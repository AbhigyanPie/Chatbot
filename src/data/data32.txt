Paragraphs:
Now more than ever, companies must focus on retaining and growing their existing customers.Acquiring customersis expensive, and most companies are seeing diminishing returns on acquisition tactics. For this reason, lower to mid-funnel tactics are gaining attention from CMOs. Companies can no longer rely upon gimmicky brand advertising on mass channels.
The following is the Lytics Playbook for retaining existing subscribers.
There are two important concepts within retention marketing as it pertains to Lytics. While these concepts apply across industries, we will focus on the subscription vertical for this playbook.  For our purposes, we will define these concepts as follows:
Lytics helps you renew and winback customers in multiple ways:
The big breakthrough for marketers is that retention teams now have the opportunity to automate consistent messaging across multiple channels. In their research,The Aberdeen Groupfound “Companies with extremely strong omnichannel customer engagement see a 9.5% year-over-year increase in annual revenue, compared to 3.4% for weak omnichannel companies. Similarly, strong omnichannel companies see a 7.5% year-over-year decrease in cost per contact, compared to a 0.2% year-over-year decrease for weak companies.”
Consider the fields available for renewal in your audiences.  Some common ones might include the time of last purchase, subscription start date, and subscription end date.  You might add additional criteria such as filters excluding complementary subscriptions.
Consider that you will likely have several renewals audiences - one per subscription.
The focus of renewals and winbacks will be cross-channel which can include:Google,Facebook,Verizon Media (Yahoo Gemini), your email service provider (ESP) available asIntegrations, and the LyticsJourney Canvas(not an export).
The most common renewal tactic is to deliver on-site modals to users with an upcoming renewal.  Take the renewal audience you created in step one, and then add custom personalized Experiences to target them.  See the slide-out modal on the left side below as an example.

Further instructions are available forbusiness usersand fordevelopers.
The email inbox is one of the most impactful places to reach your renewal users.  First, build an email in your ESP that can be triggered based on a Lytics audience.  You’ll need to follow the instructions in your ESP to do so, and this varies considerably by tool.
Once you have a triggered email built in your ESP, make use of the triggered email feature your ESP likely has.
Whatever ESP you have, you probably do not want to include “Existing Users” in the audience, so we recommend leaving that box unchecked.  Once this export is configured, new customers who enter your renewal audience will be sent the automated message.  For examples of how you can go a step further and embed custom content in your email templates, check out thisIterable use case.
Imagine incorporating your message across channels to even include telesales.  Your telesales team likely has a stronger closing rate on renewals than your site or your email programs ever could.  There are two ways to incorporate telesales:
Encourage Visitors To Call Inbound
Leveraging very simple HTML, you can createclick to callcampaigns inOrchestrate.  Then, users on a mobile phone will be able to immediately talk to a rep on the phone:

Deliver a List of Leads for Targeted Outbound
Build a list of all the upcoming renewals you care about.  Here’s an example using several audiences of subscriptions expiring within the next 30 days as building blocks for a master telesales list:

Using the same example as above, consider adding address information to the export and sending it to a fulfillment provider who can send direct mail to your renewals.

As a final note, keep in mind there are many other areas to cover including copy choices, step-by-step optimization, and common pitfalls to avoid. These are beyond the scope of this playbook, but should be taken into consideration while developing your marketing strategy to retain customers.

Paragraphs:
Lyticscontent recommendationsprovide powerful personalized, one-to-one recommendations. Sending content recommendations to your users via email is a great way to reengage them with your brand.
This guide will cover how to implement content recommendations in email withIterableas the email service provider (ESP). It will use theLytics content recommendation APIandIterable's data feedto render them inline in your email template. This technique can be combined with other email use cases such as content modularization or triggered sends for a truly rich, personalized experience.
Although you will be using the Lytics API, no code is necessary to implement this solution beyond configuring some HTML and custom variables in your email template.
You should have an Iterable account with anaudience exportrunning and anHTML email templatewith a section prepared for one or more content recommendations within it. The recommendations can include any/all of the following:
You can start by setting up your template with some static content. For context, here's how the content recommendations look in the example template that is used in this guide, it includes all of the fields listed above:

In addition, make sure you have a Lytics account with the content affinity engine activated. You will also need to generate anAPI tokenwith read access to content and user search.
To make recommendations, you will need a content collection. You can see our documentation onbuilding content collectionsfor more information. Once saved, you will also need theid of the content collectionas you will use it in the next step.
To populate recommendations in the email, you will use the Iterable feature called a Data Feed to hook into the Lytics API before sending.
Enabling this data feed in a template allows Iterable to call the Lytics content recommendation API before each email send. Iterable will replace{{#urlEncode}}{{email}}{{/urlEncode}}with the URL encoded version of the recipient's email address. The next step will cover how to access the content returned and format it to be surfaced in the email template.
You can add additional query parameters to the URL in the data feed to control things like the ranking of the recommendations or the number of documents returned. See ourContent Recommendation API documentationfor a list of possible query parameters for this end point.
Now that the data feed has been configured, it's time to apply it to your email template.
In Iterable open the template in edit mode.
Click theAdvanced optionstab and configure the following settings.
If you do not selectMerge the data feed and user contexts, you will need to use square brackets[[value]]instead of curly brackets{{value}}when accessing values from the data feed. The examples in this guide assume that this option is checked.
Under the HTML version of the template, clickSourceto view the HTML source of your template.
Locate the HTML of the recommendation section. You will need to implement templates for each of the fields you wish to use returned from the content API. Feel free to reference the response example in ourAPI documentation, but in general each field should match the following format:
Whereiis the current index of the recommendation (starting at 0), andfieldnameis one of the following:
Here is some example HTML laying out all of these fields for 3 separate recommendations:
As seen above, you must add thehttporhttpsprotocol in the href protocol before the URL field. Also the example above includes date formatting for the published date field, you can read more about this inIterable's handlebars documentation.
Once you have finished editing the template, clickSave Template. In the next step we'll verify that the data feed is working and recommendations are rendering correctly.
Iterable allows you to preview a rendered version of your email in the browser with live data from your data feed. Follow the instructions inthis tutorialto preview your email with content recommendations.

Once you're happy with the preview, you are ready to send your campaign. You can implement your template into aworkflowor send it as ablast campaign.
For best results, please talk to your Iterable representative about setting up aMessage Send Rate Limit. The Lytics' Content Recommendation API can handle up to 250 requests per second, or 15,000 requests per minute. If the rate-limit is not enabled with Iterable, Lytics may return a 429 HTTP Status Code, preventing emails from being delivered.
For more information on troubleshooting your templates, seeIterable's documentationon templating. If you're not receiving a valid response from the Lytics content recommendation API, please make sure that the email you are testing with exists as a valid profile in Lytics. You can verify this, by navigating toAudiences > Find a Userfrom the Lytics dashboard, and searching for the user you are trying to preview as. The API documentation forcontent recommendationsmay also help you verify that you're calling the endpoint correctly. If issues persist, feel free to contact[email protected]for further assistance in troubleshooting the Lytics API.

Paragraphs:
Video content is a great way to capture your users' attention. Serving your videos to a Lytics audience of users at who are likely to be interested in the content is sure to boost engagement.
In this guide, you will learn how to create a widget with a video component. While videos are not natively supported by thePathfora SDKorLytics Experiences, you can utilize a callback function to load a video with JavaScript. This callback can be applied to an Experience built through the UI with anAPI override.

Follow along with the video guide below or this written guide. You can download the complete JavaScript configuration, CSS, and API override command for this example from theGitHub examples repository.
Begin with a generic widget configuration.
This config will generate a simple modal, with a headline, message and call to action.

To add a video to the modal, you can define anonLoad callback function. This function is called just before the modal appears on the user's screen, and the variables passed to the function as arguments include the widget's DOM element, which you will append the video element to.
Start by creating adivelement which will later contain your video element. You may want to add a class name such aspf-widget-videoto style this div later. Next set theinnerHTMLof the div with the code for your video. Note that you'll need to escape quotes within the HTML when transforming it to a JavaScript string.
Now that you have the video element within adiv, simply insert thedivinto the widget. You can access the DOM node for the widget using thewidgetfield on the second argument, in this casemodule.widget. From there you will want to select two  elements with the class names:
Using theinsertBeforefunction, you can insert the div containing your video into the main content div, before the text of the widget.
With this new config you should now have a modal with a video! But it could probably use CSS to make it look cohesive.

With some additional CSS work, you can style the video to fit your modal.Download the code for this exampleto see how you can style the video to be side by side with the text of your modal.

Once you've tested and are happy with the look and feel of your video modal, it's time for the most important step: defining the Lytics audience that should receive this modal.
The example widget in this guide will be targeted at audience of users with a highcontent affinity scorefor iPhones, the product that the modal is promoting. Remember toupdate your config with the audience slugyou wish to serve the widget to.
Alternatively, you may build your widget as aweb personalize Experiencein the Lytics UI and apply theonLoadcallback with anAPI override.

Paragraphs:
Lytics web personalize Experiencesbuilt through the Lytics UI are powered behind-the-scenes by thePathfora JavaScript SDK. Not all features of the SDK are supported by the Lytics UI however such ascustom forms, orJavaScript callbacks. Luckily you can apply these features to Experiences built through the UI using a technique called API overrides.
In this guide, you will learn how to make an API requests to override the configuration of an Experience built in the Lytics UI. You will create a slideout via the Lytics Experience editor and API overrides. The overrides will include the custom form configuration, form error and success states, and the custom callback which sends the form data to a third party.

You can download the complete API request command for this example from theGithub examples repository.
The primary benefit of using the Lytics UI in combination with API overrides instead of the Pathfora SDK is that your experiences are easily integrated intoGoalsand you will have access to the native Experience, Stage, and Journey reporting features in the Lytics UI without having to build custom audiences to track users who interact with your widgets.
If you haven't already, you will need to build the base Experience through the LyticsExperience Editor. The goal is to create in the experience in the UI as close as possible the desired end state of the widget, and rely on the API overrides to fill in the gaps that are not available for configuration in the UI.
Selecting the correct tactic is key, as it determines whattypeof Pathfora widget the Experience outputs. The tactics map to types as follows:
The example in this guide uses aform widget, thus you will select theCapture Leadstactic.
You will be dropped into thecustomize form stepof the editor. Since the example form has custom checkboxes set to select which feeds to subscribe to, you can't configure this in the UI. Simply click theNext Stepbutton.
In thedesign stepenter the headline, body, and call to action text. Select theSlideoutlayout, and under theme you can check theI have my own CSSbox and enter the custom class namecustom-tracking-widget.
In thetarget step, select the audience you wish to show this slideout to. This example uses an audience of high intensity anonymous users.
In thedisplay stepconfigure when and where you want the form slideout to display on your website. This step controls to thedisplayConditionssettingsin the Pathfora SDK.
Once you've completed all the steps, you may want to preview your Experience. Though it may not look or function in the way you would like, this starting experience will generate a foundation configuration which you will augment in the next step.

You will also need to save the Experience to make API override requests. Be sure to clickSave as Draft.
To make the request for the override, you will need the ID of the Experience you just created. You can get this from the URL of the summary or review page of the experience after saving it.
In the URL example below, the ID of the Experience is2d3e345b2ac24acd9d6d3d33f93516fd:

You will also need a LyticsAPI tokenwith theAdminrole. It may help to save the token as an environment variable for future use.
You will make aPATCHrequest to the Experience endpoint with the id of the Experience. This command example usescurlandjq:
Your config changes will need to be nested in a field calleddetail_overridethis field itself is nested in theexperience.vehiclemodel:
Next you will need to convert the JavaScript configuration into a JSON payload containing the settings which you were unable to apply through the UI. In this example that is:
For the most part, you can translate a config to a JSON override in the same way that theJSON.stringify()function would convert a JS object to JSON. In this example, that works perfectly forformElementsandformStates:
But forconfirmAction, it gets tricky because it contains a JavaScript function:
However, the API can accept a JavaScript function as a string. It may help to minify your function first. There are a number of online tools or command line tools which will minify JavaScript for you. This helps for the API override because it creates a shorter, single line version of the function. This is the example callback function run through a minifier:
To include this function as a string, you will need to escape any double quotes within this before pasting it into your config.
Putting the whole thing together, your curl command will look like this:
Once you run the command, check that the response from the API includes your changes. You may make subsequentGETrequests to the same endpoint to view the entire payload of the experience.
Once you've made the API request, you should be able to view the changes as part of the regular preview process for your Experience. In the Lytics UI go the the summary or editor for your Experience. ClickPreviewand enter the URL you wish to preview the Experience on.
Note:If you are using the same browser session to preview the Experience that you did to create it, you may need to hard refresh the Lytics UI before clicking preview. This will ensure that Lytics is serving the most up to date version of the configuration.
You should be able to see the updated Experience in the preview. If this is not the case there are two scenarios to troubleshoot:
If your widget is not displaying at all, check the JavaScript console for errors. If you find a formatting error in the translated JavaScript config you may investigate and adjust your override command accordingly. This scenario can happen if you failed to escape quotes properly, for example.
If your widget is not displaying the changes, double check the response from the API and cross-reference your settings with the appropriate settings in thePathfora SDK Documentationto ensure everything is named and formatted correctly.
If the issue persists, you can always contactLytics Supportfor additional assistance with debugging.

Paragraphs:
Lytics web Experiencesare meant to provide a very simple way for marketers to spin up personalized content on their website.The Experience editorincludes some very simple options for customizing the look and feel of your Experience. But if your website has specific style guides, you may prefer to make some CSS adjustments to the Experience.
In this guide, you will learn how to construct a global stylesheet to establish a base set of styles for any Lytics Web Experience that you add to your website. In addition, this guide will cover how to write more specific styles for a single unique widget, and how to troubleshoot common issues when writing CSS for a Lytics web Experience.

You can download the completed CSS and a JavaScript configuration for testing this example from theGitHub examples repository.
If you are planning to implement many web Experiences on your site, you will want to establish a stylesheet that will lay out the foundation for common CSS rules among them. It may help to generate an Experience or Pathfora config of each layout, and think about what you want to augment for each. The example JavaScript configuration in this guide includes a slideout, bar, gate, and modal widget to test against.



The stylesheet in this guide will be kept light, by simply adding a background image to all widgets and tweaking some colors and font styles and sizes of common widget elements. However as you can imagine, you can go even further to change any aspect of the widget including the size or positioning. For reference, thePathfora SDK documentationprovides a robust list of all of the class names of elements used in Pathfora widgets.
Start by adding some general styles you would like to apply to all widgets.pf-widgetis the class name applied to the  highest leveldivelement of all Pathfora widgets.pf-widget-contentis the first child element. For slideouts, thepf-widget-contentis essentially wraps the same area aspf-widget. However for modal and gate style widgets,pf-widgetwraps the entire page with a background overlay whilepf-widget-contentcontains the modal content itself.

There's a problem though, widgets with the bar layout don't have apf-widget-contentdiv. So you can adjust the selector for the above styles as follows:

Next apply some additional styles to the call to action buttons.pf-widget-btnis the class name used on all Pathfora buttons, howeverpf-widget-okselects the first, primary CTA button.
Lastly add some styles to match the color of the headline with the widget text, and minimize the size of the thewidget footer textwhen it is not being used.

These styles will cover future widgets you wish to build on the website. As you are building your own stylesheet, if you run into issues, while testing your CSS please refer to thetroubleshooting section.
Using the Experience Editor or the Pathfora SDK, you can define a custom class name for your widget. With this class name, you can style specific elements that are unique to that widget. Always preface your selector with thepf-widgetclass name to ensure that you don't accidentally effect other elements on your website:
For a full in-depth example of specific widget styles, see theimage customization guide.
A common problem when writing CSS for Pathfora widgets is providing the correct level of specificity when selecting the element to style. If you've ever written a line of CSS and expected to see the change applied but didn't - this section is for you. The default CSS that the Pathfora library ships with is deliberately specific so that it is careful to not effect any other part of your website.
The main side effect of this is that developers wishing to override the default styles must pay special attention to their selectors or employ the use of!importantto override the default styles of the library.
Consider the following example using!important:
The selector here is short and simple. However, because the the boldfont-weightis embedded in a deeper selector in the Pathfora base styles, you have to override it with!important.
For reference, these is the relevant snippet of styles in the Pathfora CSS:
Now consider how you would need to write this CSS without using!important:
This is a ridiculously long selector! However the advantage is you no longer need to know which styles need to be overwritten with!important.
Both techniques are valid and will result in the same changes to your widget. Feel free to use whatever method is easiest for you. Keep in mind if you are using SASS, LESS, or some other CSS pre-processor that allows for nested selectors, what would longer selectors may be easier to interpret.
If you're not a fan of!important, continue reading for an in-depth look at how to easily derive the required level of specificity for your selector.
The best way to determine how to override a default style is to look the conflicting style from the CSS of the library. You can access the style sheet in thePathfora GitHub repositorywhich is open source, but it may be easier to debug your CSS using theInspect Elementfeature in Google Chrome developer tools.

Locate the relevant element in your widget by clicking on it while in the element selection mode in developer tools. You may also find it by navigating through the HTML source under theElementstab. Examine theStylestab for that element to see where the conflicting style is. Once you've located it, copy the selector and paste it in to your style sheet for modification.
Then simply add the custom class of your widget accordingly to the selector:
Add your rules, save your stylesheet, and test that the changes in the browser. Remember, you can always consult theLytics Support teamfor assistance when debugging CSS for your Web Personalize Experiences.

Paragraphs:
The Lytics JavaScript Tag commonly referred to as "JS Tag", is responsible for tracking user behavior during their site visit. This anonymous tracking is an essential input for constructing user profiles and enriching them with behavioral scores and content affinities.
In addition to tracking behavior, the Lytics JavaScript Tag is responsible for associating the current visitor with their full user profile in Lytics, known or anonymous. The subset of surfaced fields from that profile, such as Lytics Audience membership, are then available in the browser. At this point, the Lytics JavaScript Tag manages the handoff of this profile data to various web-based integrations such as Facebook Ads or Google Analytics.
The following documentation will guide you to get the most out of the Lytics platform involving your web properties.
In most cases, installing the Lytics JavaScript Tag version 3 is as easy as copying and pasting a few lines of code to your source code or Tag Manager. Full instructions and the tag itself are available from the web app.
The simplest method is using the Lytics web app verification checker. Visit your tag installation instructions, and you will find an installation checker in the top right. Be sure to visit your site after installing the tag, as this checker requires data to be fully collected and may take a few minutes to verify.
A basic check can be done using your preferred browser's JavaScript developer console. Consult your browser's documentation for access. Once you have enabled the JavaScript console, use the following command to return the installed tag version. If a version number is successfully returned, the Lytics tag has been installed correctly and has begun collecting visitor data.

With an instance ofjstaginitialized, you can easily begin collecting data about your users by firing ajstag.send()call to the SDK as demonstrated below.
The following outlines the full definition of capabilities supported by the Lytics SDK for JavaScript.
Version 3 comes configured out-of-the-box with coverage ready for most use cases. Various configuration options are available to support custom or in-depth use cases. Please find all available configuration options below with additional details listed after the table.
When callingjstag.inityou will pass in the tag configuration. You can take advantage of the above configuration options by adding them to your configuration. For example, if you want to leverage third-party cookies to enhance your brand’s ability to resolve identities between owned properties, addloadidto the configuration.

The Lytics JavaScript Tag makes collecting behavioral data about your website visitors easy. By installing our tag, you will automatically begin to collect page-level information such as URL, referrals, and browser data. This ultimately unlocks the power of a user’s content affinity. In addition to page-level data, custom data can be collected to expand user profiles further and support use cases.
The followingraw fieldsare included along with any collect event managed by the Lytics JavaScript Tag.
By default, an initial page view will be captured each time the browser fully loads a new URL. This ensures that you are collecting the base behavior out-of-the-box. Alternatively, you can capture a page view manually at any point during a session by calling thepageViewmethod.
In addition to page views, the Lytics Tag makes collecting arbitrary custom events easy. This is useful regarding user actions such as clicks, form submissions, purchases, etc. Regardless of the reason for collecting, thesendmethod can be leveraged to pass any valid JavaScript object to Lytics.
In the above example we are simply passing thekeyofnameto Lytics with a value ofJonto thedefaultdata stream. Of course, this is a basic example and something more realistic might be represented by the following examples.
In addition to a JavaScript object payload, all Lytics JavaScript Tag collection methods accept three optional parameters. These should only be implemented by advanced users who fully understand the implications of using custom streams within Lytics or require feedback on asynchronous actions.
In addition to collecting behavioral data related to a user's visit, the Lytics JavaScript Tag can also be configured to deliver real-time profile information back to the browser. By default, Lytics only returns the current audiences the visitor is a member of. However, by surfacing user fields, additional data from the visitor’s profile can be returned. Listed below are the core methods available for understanding your website visitors.
Please ensure you have access to an experienced JavaScript developer. Though most installations are straightforward, Lytics support may not be able to make recommendations or provide troubleshooting assistance as we do not have domain knowledge or access to your web property's unique source code.
Each time the Lytics JavaScript Tag is loaded, it will attempt to identify the visitor. This is done through a variety of means, the first of which is the first party_uidcookie. A unique identifier is generated and stored in the browser. This_uidis then included as part of the outbound payload in all collect methods from the JavaScript Tag aiding in identity resolution. In some cases, a developer must access or manipulate this ID. In those cases, there are two methods available.
Manipulating the_uidis an advanced feature and can significantly impact how your profiles are compiled. Use at your own risk.
Because getting the unique identifier can be an asynchronous process, you must pass a callback function with the request. Upon completing the lookup, this callback function will be called and passed an attribute that represents the visitor’s unique identifier.
Because loading of the current user's profile is done in real-time, a request to our profile API is required. This request is handled asynchronously as to never negatively impact your web properties. As such, it is recommended that access to this profile is always handled through our callback. This ensures you receive the expected result and do not run the risk of race conditions or other browser issues related to asynchronous requests. For use cases that can't support an asynchronous call, please see audiences cached in local storage below for an alternative option.
To initialize a callback simply add a listener on theentityReadyfunction:
Once the profile has been loaded, your callback function will be called and passed adataobject. By default, this data object will only contain the audiences the visitor is a member of and have also been enabled for API access. In addition to audience membership, any surfaced user fields will also be available on the object.
In the example above the three audiences in thesegmentsarray have been enabled for API access and theemailuser field has been explicitly surfaced for the account.
By default, Version 3 of the Lytics JS Tag caches the visitor's audience membership in local storage instead of a cookie. A forthcoming integration has been planned to support writing a cookie as well to facilitate some edge use cases but in the case of zero latency needs, local storage represents a better, more scalable storage solution for this type of data. In order to access the cached values on page load before the Lytics JavaScript tag has loaded the profile, you might implement something like:
In some cases it is desired to use an identifier different than the Lytics cookie, for exampleuseridfor a logged in user. This configuration option is available by definingbyFieldKeyandbyFieldValueon theentitykey of the core Lytics JavaScript Tag configuration.
Some web properties will be built as Single Page Apps (SPA). SPAs shouldalwaysbe configured and managed by an experienced developer. They represent a series of unique behaviors, many unique to particular frameworks, that can impact how the Lytics JavaScript Tag needs to be configured to support the desired use cases.
Version 3 of the Lytics JavaScript Tag has been built with SPAs in mind, along with other significant improvements. For most SPAs, there are two important things to consider as routes change:
Each of these actions are handled independently with two simple commands.
While it's possible to download and examine the core Lytics JavaScript Tag (JS Tag) source files (latest.js,latest.min.jsorlio.js), storing or serving these file(s) locally or from another domain is not recommended. Referencing the Lytics JS Tag files from Lytics' servers (i.e.,<https://c.lytics.io/api/tag/someid/latest.js>) ensures that you get access to new features and product updates as they become available, giving you the most reliable collection and delivery of your data.
That said, in some extreme cases it may be a requirement to serve all JavaScript files from your own secure environment. In these cases, we've created this document to outline the benefits, drawbacks, and a suggested approach.
Given these benefits and drawbacks, if your organization still wants to proceed with hosting the Lytics JS Tag, see the following steps to get started.
Before you begin, ensure you are installing version 3 of the Lytics JS Tag. Version 2 can't be hosted outside of Lytics, which means you will be restricted to version 3 of the tag.
Getting up and running with a hosted version of the Lytics JS Tag comes down to three main steps:
Accessing the source code and default configuration.Navigating to the source code is relatively simple. The URL can be found by visiting the Tag Installation section of the Lytics app. The tag sample on that page will include ajstag.initfunction. One line below that you will see asrcdefinition and a URL that looks something like//c.lytics.io/api/tag/.... Copying and pasting that URL into a new browser window will result in the core JavaScript tag to be loaded. Most browsers will allow you to File -> Save the source from this point to your local machine.
Hosting the source code and default configuration.The output file that was created above will need to be hosted on a public server within your infrastructure. Unfortunately, there is little to no guidance Lytics can offer here other than to be sure the hosting solution can handle the necessary load generated by your web asset(s).
Initializing the tag.Return to the Tag Installation section and copy and paste the entire script tag as you normally would. ThesrcURL in theinitconfig will need to be updated with the URL of your now hosted JavaScript tag. You'll likely end up with something like this:
Once your tag has been hosted and initialized properly, we recommend you complete the verification steps to ensure everything has been installed and is working properly.

Tag Managers make it easier to work with vendor JavaScript (JS) tags like Lytics for large, dynamic web assets. Lytics can be integrated through virtually every Tag Manager on the market today. Because each Tag Manager is different, the level of integration and development lift can vary so please consult the documentation for your preferred Tag Manager for specific details.
That being said, installation of the Lytics JS Tag is generally as simple as copying and pasting the snippet of code from theinstallation instructionsin the Lytics app to a container within your Tag Manager, and then publishing to your live instance from there.
Google Tag Manager(GTM) is recommended as a flexible and transparent Tag Manager. Follow the steps below to install the Lytics JS Tag using GTM.
The Lytics JavaScript library uses two primary APIs:
There are a few steps to ensure the Lytics JavaScript (JS) Tag is properly installed and receives data from your website.
The core JavaScript tag has a helper method that will returntrueif all Lytics resources have been loaded properly. Open theconsole in Chrome Developer toolsthen copy and paste the following to verify that the tag has finished loaded.
The Lytics Jstag sends data to Lytics after every page view or on a custom trigger configured by the client. Those "sends" are captured in the network tab in developer tools. When the data is sent, how it is sent, and if it was sent successfully are all stored within the network call metadata.
To start select the network tab and filter on"lytics.io". Once the list is populated, select a line that us structured like the one highlighted below:

The request URL can be found at the top of the "Header" section. This url indicates that data is being sent to Lytics via the /c endpoint.

The actual attributes that were sent to Lytics can be seen in the "Payload" section as seen below:

Testing
To test the sending method there is also the jstag.send() function from the console and that will send a single payload to the account configured as the cid in the initialization of the tag. Please see the example below for syntax:

The network call should then show an event sending to Lytics:

_Finally, validate the event made it to Lytics by verifying the event has come in the UI via the stream/pipeline:
The Lytics Jstag will use the/personalizeendpoint to retrieve the entity on every pageview. This ensures that the most relevant information is considered when deciding what the consumer experience should be while they are navigating the webpage.
To start select the network tab and filter on"lytics.io". Once the list is populated select a line that us structured like the one highlighted below:

The request URL can be found at the top of the "Header" section. This url indicates that data is being retrieved from Lytics via the /personalize endpoint.

Additionally the preview tab, as seen below, can be very useful in understanding what information has been pulled in to update the consumers profile client side.

Several types of consumer data are stored client side:
Consumer attributeswill be actual data from the profile like first_name, last_name etc... This information is stored on the entity itself and can be accessed for personalization. The Lytics user has full control over what attributes appear client side.
_In this example _uids has been allow listed in the account settings to surface client side.
_Account Setting:

Console in Dev Tools:

Consumer behaviorsexpose the different audiences a consumer is currently in and current experiences/campaigns they qualify for.
Both of these behaviors can be found in the payload returned when calling jstag.getEntity in the console as seen below:
Experiences

Audiences

You can see the audiences the current user is a member of using the following in yourChrome developer console:
This callback will return a list of audiences the user is a member of and should only be called after the user profile has loaded.
If you're trying to test a use case that requires a certain audience membership in the browser, follow these general tips in order to create a proper testing environment and not run into merge conflicts and false positives:
Always use incognito mode.An incognito window removes all cookies, caches, etc. ensuring you have no history with the site and that no email addresses share a cookie. The entirety of a test session must take place in the same incognito window so that all actions tie to the same profiles. All incognito windows must be closed between testing sessions to clear all cookies.Google provides instructions for opening an incognito window.
Document your testing path.Keep a testing doc that reflects the date and time of when you tested, the link of the Lytics audience you are testing, along with results and screenshots. This will assist Lytics support in tracking and debugging any issues.
If you are testing audiences that tie email and cookie actions together, you will need to perform a merge event which ties the web cookie and email together, keep the following in mind:
Use a test email only once, and then expire it after that.As mentioned above, document and log everything including which email address was used for each test. Google allows you to use punctuation in email addresses, while still sending to the same account. For example:[email protected]and[email protected]will both be delivered to the same inbox, however, Lytics will create separate profiles for each. This will cut down on how many emails you have to create.
Ensure that a merge event occurs.This will tie the incognito session cookie with your test email. Here are a few examples of how you may achieve this:
Anonymous user audiences consist of audiences containing anonymous users. When testing audiences that rely on the Lytics web cookie ID:
If you're troubleshooting numbers such as user counts within Lytics,check out this FAQon why your numbers may differ and our acceptable margin of error described below.
It is common to perform quality checks against audiences in Lytics vs. your other sources of truth. In a successful implementation, Lytics can reconcile users across channels and merge profiles, which makes one-to-one comparisons tough. However, below are quality checks that can be performed to ensure that the numbers you are seeing in Lytics match up as expected with other common data sources:
Google Audience/Web Analytics often reports higher numbers than Lytics. One main reason is Google Analytics reports how much unique traffic made it to a page. Lytics reports how many user profiles visited a page across browsers and devices. For any additional validation, you can export raw events or audience membership to Google Big Query, Amazon S3, or another data warehouse to query against.
Please contactLytics supportfor assistance understanding or troubleshooting these numbers.

Paragraphs:
Subresource Integrity (SRI) is a security feature that enables browsers to verify that the resources they fetch (for example, from a CDN) are delivered without unexpected manipulation. It allows you to provide a cryptographic hash that a fetched resource must match. This definition is sourced from MDN Web Docs, where full documentation on SRI is found.
The following demonstrates a simple, non-lytics-specific example, as provided by MDM, of how the cryptographic hash can be added to a standard script element to validate that what is loaded is, in fact, what is expected:
It is essential to remember that SRI is very technical and will require development resources on your end to facilitate. Lytics can support SRI technically but offers no services or off-the-shelf solutions.
An SRI requirement often stems from strict security compliance for enterprise-level policies. Though it adds a layer of certainty that the file you expect matches precisely what is delivered, the overhead for managing SRI is often not worth the investment.
Please read the following section carefully as leveraging SRI will have significant impacts on several of the out-of-the-box functions of the Lytics product. All will still be possible but will likely require additional, manual, steps.
With this approach comes a few significant implications:
The following outlines a recommended but not exclusive approach to implementing SRI. The following also outlines several options that may or may not be relevant based on your account's features in use and configuration specifics.
//c.lytics.io/api/tag/{{ACCOUNT_ID}}/latest.min.jsThis is the core JavaScript web SDK. It is used for identification, data collection, and personalization via the standard profile callbacks or our out-of-the-box web personalization campaigns/experiences.
//c.lytics.io/static/pathfora.min.jsThis is the core web personalization SDK managed by Lytics. This is used, and only used, to test and deploy the various Lytics web personalization Experiences and/or Campaigns. Anyone who is leveraging our modals or inline personalization/recommendations will need to ensure Pathfora is included in the SRI strategy. For those that aren't leveraging this directly, they may opt to alternatively turn Pathfora SDK off, which will prevent both this JS file and the following CSS file from being loaded.
//c.lytics.io/static/pathfora.min.cssThis default CSS file informs the look and feel of our web personalization Experiences. This file, though required, can also be hosted and customized to your liking as outlined below in the tag configuration section.
//c.lytics.io/api/experience/candidate/{{ACCOUNT_ID}}/config.jsFinally, this file loads the configuration for web personalization Experiences and Campaigns. If you leverage any Lytics-managed web Experience, this file must be included in the SRI strategy and updated each time an Experience changes.NO EXPERIENCE WILL BE UPDATED, DEPLOYED, OR SHUT OFFautomatically with SRI in place.
Due to SRI requiring the static asset, which is also loaded to match the fixed hash, all assets outlined above must be copied and hosted at an alternative location outside of Lytics' purview. This means that no bug fixes, updates, configuration changes, etc., will be managed directly by Lytics. As part of this asset management, an independent update process is recommended to be in place.
For instance, if a web Experience is configured and set to go live on the first of January, a manual update would need to be made to pull in the proper.latest.min.jsandconfig.jsfile contains the Experience information before it will show live on your site. In addition, in this example, Pathfore must also be enabled and available on the site.
Outside of the technical lift required to provide a web-accessible hosting solution, which will not be covered here, accessing, downloading, and surfacing the necessary files outlined above is relatively easy. You should be able to download the above files via your preferred method and surface that same file on a managed domain. As an example,//c.lytics.io/api/tag/{{ACCOUNT_ID}}/latest.min.jsbecomes//acme.co/lyticsjstag/latest.min.jsor whatever naming convention you'd prefer to leverage. From there, you will need to configure the asynchronous tag wrapper responsible for initializing Lytics to point to this new asset as outlined below:
Additionally, if you are using Pathfora as outlined above, the following configuration should be included to point at all of the proper static assets:
Finally, since JavaScript tag-related settings will not take effect immediately, it is possible to manually configure many of those directly in the tag as well, if preferred over an SRI update. For any other settings within theJavaScripttag section of Vault settings management consult with support for the best path forward.

The Lytics SDK for iOS makes it easy for developers to identify, manage consent, and collect user activity data from their native mobile apps. This ensures all critical channels can be associated with fully resolved user profiles. This section explains how to integrate Lytics into your iOS apps. If you are looking for information on Android apps, see the LyticsSDK for Android.
Here we will cover how the Lytics SDK for iOS enables the following:
Before you begin implementing the Lytics SDK for iOS, please make sure you have the following:
You can add the Lytics SDK to an Xcode project as a package dependency.
A variety of top-levelconfigurationoptions are available to ensure the SDK can be tailored to the needs of your particular application. To get started, however, we need only add your valid Lytics API token to theLytics.shared.startinitialization call as outlined below:
Once we have initialized the SDK, it is a best practice toidentifythe user anywhere formally they provide additional strong identifiers, such as a username or email, upon login, for example. This ensures your profiles have the highest potential for properly unifying across your various data sources.
Do note, this step is optional. By default, the Lytics SDK will create an anonymous identifier for all users and leverage that to merge with disparate sources as we do with our traditional web-based JavaScript SDK.
Once the user has been identified (optional), we can begintrackingvarious activities throughout their visit. Typical activities include screen views, clicks, purchases, etc. A full scope of event tracking flexibility can be found in the technical documentation section below.
The following outlines the full definition of capabilities supported by the Lytics SDK for iOS.
When initializing the Lytics SDK withLytics.shared.start, a variety of top-level configuration options are available to ensure the SDK can be tailored to the needs of your particular application:
Each of the above configuration options can be added to the initialLytics.shared.startinstantiation of the Lytics SDK as outlined here:
Lytics.shared.identifyis used to emit strong identifiers and attributes associated with your app user. This method provides a means to store the primary identifiers on the device itself so that all future event tracking from that device automatically is appended with information necessary to maximize the effectiveness of your identity resolution strategy. For eachLytics.shared.identifycall, you have the option to only store that data to the device or emit it to a Lytics event stream for mapping to profiles. Emitting all event types to a Lytics event stream is always our recommendation.
Exampleidentifycall where we set pass a custom stream, set of identifiers, and attributes:
Lytics.shared.trackemits activity data for a particular app user to a Lytics even stream. Each track call will automatically be appended with the strong identifiers stored on the device to ensure the highest potential resolution against Lytics user profiles.Lytics.shared.trackcalls can include a variety of optional parameters and data associated with the interaction as defined below:
Exampletrackcall where we track a purchase event and its associated properties:
Lytics.shared.screenis an additional method for appending device information to the traditional track call. This is an extension of the above definition and results in including the following information with all events:
Depending on your application's particular needs, various data privacy controls are available by default. Below you'll find the optional methods and examples of scenarios where some or all may be most applicable.
Lytics.shared.consentis a specific event type for collecting critical information related to consent, such as location, document, etc. As a best practice, aLytics.shared.consentevent should always be leveraged alongside theLytics.shared.optIn()event to ensure proper documentation of consent:
Lytics.shared.optIn()sets the state of a user's activity tracking preference. By default, all users are opted in. This default setting is fully configurable at the top-level SDK configuration. In either case, an explicit call toLytics.shared.optIn()will result in activities being tracked and sent to a Lytics stream.
Lytics.shared.optOut()is the opposite of the aboveLytics.shared.optInmethod and will prevent activity data from being emitted to Lytics after it has been called until an additional.Lytics.shared.optIn()call has been made.
IDFAoradvertisingIdentifieris an alphanumeric string that is unique to each device. Collection of this identifier requires explicit confirmation from the app user, which the Lytics SDK for iOS can trigger. In addition, upon confirmation, the IDFA will be treated as a strong identifier and included with all outbound events emitted to Lytics streams for improved resolution.
The Lytics SDK for iOS offers two methods to collect IDFA and handle the opt-out of IDFA.
To present a required modal asking for tracking access and storage/inclusion of the device-specific IDFA upon confirmation, call the following method:
To disable the storing and emitting of the user's device specific IDFA, call the following method:
Several utility-type methods are available for flushing queues, resetting stored data, and performing general maintenance or debugging.
Occasionally, it may be desired to force a flush of the event queue. This is common after a series of events, before sign-out, etc. This method will bypass any queue caps or timers and result in all queued events being emitted:
Strong identifiers and attributes are stored locally on the device. In general, there are not likely to be many use cases where it is necessary to delete all stored data and reset the SDK. By doing so, the resolution will become much more complex, and all identifiers, even anonymous, will no longer be accessible. That said, in the case of a shared device where a user is logging in and out or in the more common case of a test device, the following method is available to delete all data stored by the Lytics SDK for iOS:
Be it for testing or presenting a profile to the end user, the complete stored device-level profile is available with the following method. Do note, this is only the stored data as a result ofLytics.shared.identifycalls and does not represent the complete user profile from the Lytics system and cross-channel sources.
The Lytics SDK for iOS is optimized to leverage the fewest number of APIs possible. As such, all event collection is managed by leveraging the coreLytics event collection API.
When enabled, the.debuglog level will result in additional logs to aid troubleshooting and issue resolution. Don't hesitate to contact customer support if you have trouble implementing the Lytics SDK for iOS.

The Lytics SDK forReact Nativemakes it easy for developers to identify, manage consent, and collect user activity data from their native mobile apps. This ensures all critical channel data can be associated with fully resolved user profiles. This section explains how to integrate Lytics into your React Native apps.
Here, we will cover how the Lytics React Native SDK enables the following:
Before you begin implementing the Lytics SDK for React Native, please make sure you have the following:
Install the core React Native Library
Add the following permissions to your AndroidManifest.xml file:
This permission is required to send events to the Lytics API:
This permission is technically optional but highly recommended to allow the library to determine the best time to send events to the API.
Install native iOS modules:
There are several configuration options outlined below. At a minimum, however, you must initialize the SDK with a validAPI tokenwith data access to your Lytics account.
Once we have initialized the SDK, it is a best practice toidentifythe user anywhere they provide additional strong identifiers, such as a username or email, upon login. This ensures your profiles have the highest potential for properly unifying across your various data sources as soon as they identify themselves.
Do note that this step is optional. By default, the Lytics SDK will create an anonymous identifier for all users and leverage that to merge disparate sources as we do with our traditional web-based JavaScript SDK.
Once the user has been identified (optional), we can begintrackingvarious activities throughout their visit. Typical activities include screen views, clicks, purchases, etc. A full scope of event tracking flexibility can be found in the technical documentation section below.

When initializing the Lytics SDK withstart(), a variety of top-level configuration options are available to ensure the SDK can be tailored to the needs of your particular application:
Each of the above configuration options can be added to the initialstart()instantiation of the Lytics SDK as outlined here:
identify()is used to emit strong identifiers and attributes associated with your app user. This method provides a means to store the primary identifiers on the device itself so that all future event tracking from that device automatically is appended with information necessary to maximize the effectiveness of your identity resolution strategy. For eachidentify()call, you have the option to only store that data to the device or emit it to a Lytics event stream for mapping to profiles. Emitting all event types to a Lytics event stream is always our recommendation.
Exampleidentifycall where we set pass a custom stream, set of identifiers, and attributes:
track()emits activity data for a particular app user to a Lytics even stream. Each track call will automatically be appended with the strong identifiers stored on the device to ensure the highest potential resolution against Lytics user profiles.track()calls can include a variety of optional parameters and data associated with the interaction as defined below:

Depending on your application's needs, various data privacy controls are available by default. Below are the optional methods and examples of scenarios where some or all may be most applicable.
consent()is a specific event type for collecting critical information related to consent, such as location, document, etc. As a best practice, aconsent()event should always be leveraged alongside theoptIn()event to ensure proper documentation of consent:
optIn()sets the state of a user's activity tracking preference. By default, all users are opted in. This default setting is fully configurable at the top-level SDK configuration. In either case, an explicit call tooptIn()will result in activities being tracked and sent to a Lytics stream.
optOut()is the opposite of the aboveoptInmethod and will prevent activity data from being emitted to Lytics after it has been called until an additional.optIn()call has been made.
The Lytics SDK for React Native streamlines tracking authorization with unified calls for both iOS and Android platforms. However, it's important to note that each platform may still necessitate specific configurations to prompt for and gather device identifiers effectively.
Requesting authorization, be it for IDFA or GAID, is invoked through arequestTrackingAuthorization()call:
In addition, if at any point the user chooses to revoke access, that can be initiated via thedisableTracking()call:
IDFAoradvertisingIdentifieris an alphanumeric string that is unique to each device. Collection of this identifier requires explicit confirmation from the app user, which the Lytics SDK for iOS can trigger. In addition, upon confirmation, the IDFA will be treated as a strong identifier and included with all outbound events emitted to Lytics streams for improved resolution.
To access the IDFA from iOS devices you must add the theNSUserTrackingUsageDescriptiondependency to your appsInfo.plistfile.
GAIDthe Google Advertising ID (GAID) is a unique identifier assigned to each user's device by Google for Android devices. It's used for tracking and targeting purposes in advertising and analytics applications. GAID allows advertisers and developers to collect data on user behavior and preferences in a way that respects their privacy preferences. Users have control over their GAID, with the ability to reset it or opt out of personalized advertising, ensuring user privacy. This system is analogous to Apple's IDFA (Identifier for Advertisers) on iOS devices.
To access the GAID from Android devices you must add the Google Play Services dependency as follows to yourbuild.gradlefile:
Several utility-type methods are available for flushing queues, resetting stored data, and performing general maintenance or debugging.
Occasionally, it may be desired to force a flush of the event queue. This is common after a series of events, before sign-out, etc. This method will bypass any queue caps or timers and result in all queued events being emitted:
Strong identifiers and attributes are stored locally on the device. In general, there are not likely to be many use cases where it is necessary to delete all stored data and reset the SDK. By doing so, the resolution will become much more complex, and all identifiers, even anonymous, will no longer be accessible. That said, in the case of a shared device where a user is logging in and out or in the more common case of a test device, the following method is available to delete all data stored by the Lytics SDK for React Native:
Accessing the current user's profile for personalization is a key aspect of the Lytics SDK for React Native. To access the user profile, we've provided thegetProfile()as outlined below:
Note: If for any reason the getProfile() call fails on iOS no profile will be returned whereas in the Android version any known information that is stored on the device will be returned.
The Lytics SDK for React Native is optimized to leverage the fewest number of APIs possible. As such, all event collection is managed by leveraging the coreLytics event collection API.
When enabled, the.debuglog level will result in additional logs to aid troubleshooting and issue resolution. Don't hesitate to contact customer support if you have trouble implementing the Lytics SDK for React Native.

GAIDoradvertisingIdentifieris an alphanumeric string that is unique to each device. Collection of this identifier requires explicit confirmation from the app user, which the Lytics SDK for Android can trigger. In addition, upon confirmation, the GAID will be treated as a strong identifier and included with all outbound events emitted to Lytics streams for improved resolution.
The Lytics SDK for Android offers two methods to collect GAID and handle the opt-out of GAID.
To present a required modal asking for tracking access and storage/inclusion of the device-specific GAID upon confirmation, call the following method:
To disable the storing and emitting of the user's device-specific GAID, call the following method:
To support collecting the Android Advertising ID, add the following to the application's gradle dependencies:
implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads-identifier:18.0.1'
Additionally, declare a Google Play services normal permission in the manifest file as follows:
<uses-permission android:name="com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID"/>
After confirming with the user and getting their consent, enable Advertiser ID collection viaLytics.enableGAID().
The user's Android Advertising ID will be sent with each event's identifiers.
Note, the user can disable or change the Advertising ID via the Android system privacy settings.
Several utility-type methods are available for flushing queues, resetting stored data, and performing general maintenance or debugging.
Occasionally, it may be desired to force a flush of the event queue. This is common after a series of events, before sign-out, etc. This method will bypass any queue caps or timers and result in all queued events being emitted:
Strong identifiers and attributes are stored locally on the device. In general, there are not likely to be many use cases where it is necessary to delete all stored data and reset the SDK. By doing so, the resolution will become much more complex, and all identifiers, even anonymous, will no longer be accessible. That said, in the case of a shared device where a user is logging in and out or in the more common case of a test device, the following method is available to delete all data stored by the Lytics SDK for Android:
Be it for testing or presenting a profile to the end user, the complete stored device-level profile is available with the following method. Do note, this is only the stored data as a result ofLytics.shared.identifycalls and does not represent the complete user profile from the Lytics system and cross-channel sources.
The Lytics SDK for Android is optimized to leverage the fewest number of APIs possible. As such, all event collection is managed by leveraging the coreLytics event collection API.
When enabled, the.debuglog level will result in additional logs to aid troubleshooting and issue resolution. Don't hesitate to contact customer support if you have trouble implementing the Lytics SDK for Android.

If you don’t see your ads or marketing tool in our integrations list we offer the following options to connect with other platforms. With our Integration Options we enable flexibility across the various channels where your data exists and tools to build customized integrations. Lytics Integration Options include:
Read on for details on each option. If you have questions about any of these options or would like to further explore an integration with a specific platform reach out to your Lytics contact.
Webhooks offer one of the simplest and most flexible options for enabling applications to share data. They’re broadly used in the cloud computing world for integrations that can be stood up quickly with a minimal amount of code. The Lytics Webhook integration supports triggered delivery of audience membership (enters and exits) to a destination url where another application can pick it up. See ourWebhook documentationfor full details.
Interested to understand how a Webhook integration might be applied? Look at thisMobile Messaging use casefor a simple Lytics Webhook integration to support one-to-one personalized messaging with Twilio.
Server-to-server file transfer is a very common mechanism for data sharing. Lytics File Service options enable Lytics to pull or push user data from an SFTP (secure file transfer protocol) using a CSV (comma-separated values) or JSON file. If you have another platform that also enables integrations via SFTP, this integration path helps to automate the process of passing data between your system and Lytics. Check out theLytics File Service documentationto learn about setting up the file transfer job.
In addition to SFTP, Amazon S3 is a very commonly used medium for server-to-server file transfer. Refer to ourAmazon S3 documentationfor data import and export options.
The Lytics JS Tag is the default option for client-side (website) data sharing with Lytics. The JS Tag supports the delivery of user behavior attributes from your website into Lytics and can also return back to the website user profile data such as audience members or content recommendations from Lytics for real time personalization. Refer to our JS Tag Documentation for full details.
The Lytics Mobile SDK facilitates in-app data sharing with iOS and Android. Similar to the JS Tag, the Mobile SDK supports user behavior-based data delivery to Lytics and profile data to the app for real-time personalization. See ourMobile SDK Documentationfor more details.
If you already use a data warehouse to manage your data this is a great option for data import and export with Lytics. Lytics integrates with
Each of these providers offers options for importing data into databases which can then be imported into Lytics using Cloud Connect or our Data Import integrations. Lytics can also export data into each of these data warehouses.

Paragraphs:
This guide offers an overview of options for leveraging Lytics standard integration capabilities to connect with Adobe’s ads products.
The decisioning capabilities of Lytics can be combined with the personalized activation proficiency of the Adobe products:
Adobe Campaign
Lytics can export file based data to Adobe Campaign via hourly/daily CSV file export to an SFTP location. Adobe Campaign can import CSV files from its own secure location. This is more of a limitation on the Adobe Campaign side regarding limited API access.
There are many ways to get data into Lytics from Adobe Analytics. One common method is to use the Lytics Javascript tag (jstag.send) function to send eVars directly from the data layer into Lytics on page load. This method will simplify the onboarding process and minimize the need to do a data transfer from Adobe Analytics on a regular basis.
As part of onboarding, we can help identify which data you would like to pull in for activation and identify the right mechanisms for ingestion. Lytics provides ways to ingest this data from scheduled SFTP pickups to Bulk API imports or transactional APIs.
Our Javascript Tag will communicate user audience membership to Adobe Target, which will respond with the appropriate site personalizations.  This Lytics data will be returned from our platform on page load and the Users Profile, segmentation information and content recommendations will be placed in the web page data layer.
You can pass this information simply by leveraging the lio.data.segments object that is loaded onto every page where the Lytics JS tag is deployed.
Similar to other Adobe products, Adobe Ad Cloud supports the consumption of user audiences via SFTP, Json file upload, API (Lytics can create a webhook to stream data - but more conversation with Adobe will be needed) as well as direct from other Adobe products like Adobe Audience Manager.
Lytics can also directly send audiences from Lytics into ad platforms (e.g. Facebook, Google, Linkedin, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, LiveRamp.  With our Google partnership, Lytics has early access to Google’s API-based integration for custom audiences within DV360.
We can deliver audiences into Audience Manager via SFTP or Data Warehouse integration, similar to how the above integrations have been documented.

Import email, push, or mobile activity from Amazon Pinpoint to add behavior data to your user profiles in Lytics.
Importing Pinpoint activity into Lytics requires setting up an export of Pinpoint Events to Kinesis. SeeAmazon's documentationfor more information, and follow theseinstructionsto set it up via the Pinpoint UI.
This integration uses theAmazon Kinesis Data Streams Service APIsto get Pinpoint activity records from the Kinesis stream in near real-time. You can then start the Pinpoint import job in Lytics.
The following fields are included in the default mapping of thepinpoint_activitystream:
Follow these steps to set up and configure an import of Pinpoint activity in the Lytics platform. If you are new to creating jobs in Lytics, see theData Sourcesdocumentation for more information.
If activity data is avaiable in the Kinesis Pinpoint stream, the data will appear in Lytics within a few minutes.
Export Lytics audiences to add audience membership data to your Pinpoint endpoints, and send targeted notifications using Pinpoint as users enter or exit Lytics audiences.
This integration utilizes thePinpoint REST APIsto send Pinpoint events that set an attribute for a PinpointEndpointas a user enters or exits an audience in Lytics.
By default, Lytics exports the following fields to Pinpoint.
Follow these steps to set up and configure an export of a Lytics audience to Pinpoint.
If theExisting Usersoption is selected, audience data should be in Pinpoint within minutes. Otherwise, data will be seen when a new user enters or exits the exported audience.

Amazon Redshiftis a cloud data warehouse service provided by Amazon. With Redshift, you can query and combine structured and semi-structured data across your data warehouse, operational database, and data lake using standard SQL. Redshift lets you easily save the results of your queries back to S3. Connect Lytics to your Redshift database to leverage Lytics' data science and audience building capabilities on your data.
If you haven't already done so, you will need to set up an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account before you begin the process described below. See theRedshift Getting Started Guideto get started with Amazon Redshift. You will also have to add Lytic's IPs to yourcluster's ingress rules. Contact your Account Manager for the current list of Lytics' IP addresses.
There are two Redshift Authorization Types:
To set up AWS Redshift User you will need the following credentials: database username and password. See theRedshift Users Guidefor instructions on how to create a user in Amazon Redshift. If you are new to creating authorizations in Lytics, see theAuthorizationsdocumentation for more information.

The Redshift Export lets you create and keep updated an AWS Redshift table based on a Lytics audience. With your audience in Redshift you can use your already existing analytics tools to gain new insight into your users.
Steps/Pattern:
The Redshift Export is a two step export, it first exports users to Amazon S3, then executes a COPY operation to load those files to a table in Redshift. The table's name is based on the Lytic's audience's slug name. The files are setup to expire after 72 hours, so no manual cleanup is needed. Executing the COPY command to a temporary table allows the main table to continue to be used while data is loading; Only the brief time when the main table is removed and the temporary table is renamed will the data be unavailable. The temporary table is a full table and not an actualtemporary tablein Redshift.
By default, Lytics exports all user fields to Redshift. You may configure the fields to export by selecting them in theFields to Exportinput.Fields in Redshift will match their Lytics field names. The type depends onthe field type in Lytics:

Paragraphs:
TheAmazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)is a flexible object storage service optimized for scalability and security. Common use cases for S3 include storage for web applications, backup and recovery, disaster recovery, data lakes, and hybrid cloud storage.
Integrating Lytics with AWS S3 provides the ability to import or export files to your S3 buckets. This makes your data available to the Amazon ecosystem for reporting, analytics and archiving. Many tools provide the ability to import and export to/from S3; therefore, by linking Lytics and S3 you gain access to the wide ecosystem of tools that integrate with S3.
If you have not already done so, you will need to set up anAmazon S3 accountbefore you begin the process described below.
If you are using an IP allowlist for your AWS S3 account, contact your account administrator to add Lytics' IP addresses to your allowlist. Reach out to your Lytics Account Manager for the current list of IP addresses.
You may authorize in one of two ways:
Follow the steps below to authorize AWS with Lytics using your AWS keys. For more information on obtaining your keys, see Amazon's documentation onsecret and access keys.
If you are new to creating authorizations in Lytics, see theAuthorizationsdocumentation for more information.
To create an authorization with AWS keys and PGP encryption, follow the steps as described above, and then select either the Private or Public PGP Keys option.
Note that currently the Ed25519 method of encryption is not supported
You can also authorize using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). For more information see Amazon's documentation onIAM.
You will need to enter the following policy in your S3 bucket:
Before you start a job, please letLytics Supportknow the name of the bucket you are going to use. This will allow delegated access to the given bucket. When you start the job, just selectUse Delegated Access To Lytics with AWS IAMinstead of an AWS keys authorization.
To create an authorization with Delegated AWS access and PGP encryption, follow the steps as described above to set up delegated access, and then select either the Private or Public PGP Keys option.

This integration facilitates the enrichment of Lytics user profiles with valuable information, including identifiers, activity data, and more from Ansira.
Enabling the Ansira and Lytics integration empowers customers to enhance Lytics user profiles by incorporating user-level data from the Ansira platform. This integration facilitates the enrichment of Lytics user profiles with valuable information, including identifiers, activity data, and more. By seamlessly connecting Ansira's extensive data resources with the Lytics user profiling capabilities, customers gain a comprehensive understanding of their users' preferences, behaviors, and interactions. This enables more personalized and targeted marketing strategies, fostering deeper customer engagement and driving better business outcomes.

To successfully send and receive requests to the Ansira APIs, we must create an OAuth-based authorization using the key and secret outlined below.
This integration leverages our Webhook integration to connect with and retrieve data from Ansira's endpoints. Begin by selecting theWebhooksprovider tile.

Next, select an authorization method. If this is your first time creating an authorization for Ansira, selectOAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant.

Next, we'll configure the authorization to use a key and secret provided by Ansira. Please configure all fields as outlined below and leave any additional fields blank unless you fully understand the implications.
Create a label for your authorization. This will only be surfaced in the Lytics UI for easy navigation when selecting the authorization in additional workflows or reviewing the details and logs.

Add an optional description to provide context for where the auth came from and how it will be used.

Ansira will provide the token URL. This is the endpoint used to get a token. In most cases, your specific instance information will replace the XXXX in the example.

Enter the provided Client ID from Ansira.

Enter the provided Client Secret from Ansira.

Lastly, since the Ansira API expects an access token as part of the request, we must configure the additional parameters to include the token generated via OAuth, as described below.

This integration utilizes theLytics' Enrichment Webhookto send a secure request to Ansira when a user enters a source audience. This request is sent to thePOST/service/api/v2/userendpoint and contains user data configured within the template described below to enrich a Lytics profile with extended information about that user within Ansira. We'll outline the following steps to achieve enable this enrichment workflow:
Select or configure a new authorization as outlinedabove.
This integration works by ensuring every member of an audience has been enriched with Ansira data. In most cases, the desired outcome is matching a UUID or Ansira-specific identifier with an email address. Though the source audience is ultimately up to each customer's discretion, we recommend keeping the following in mind:
Webhook templates are created usingjsonnet. These templates provide a flexible way to reformat the outbound payload of a webhook request to meet the recipient's requirements. In this case, we'll create a template that provides the proper formatting of email and source ids for the AnsirauserAPI. This step may appear to be technical. As such, if you need assistance, please get in touch with your technical account manager or primary point of contact.
Jsonnet is highly customizable. In the example above, we pull theemailfrom the profile and hard code asourceCodekeyNameIf the desire is for thekeyNameto be dynamic, this could also leverage the.event.getmethod to pull the value from each profile. If you use the dynamic method, the field name in the event.get() function is the field name that has been defined in the Lytics schema, as seen in the example below:
To handle the response from the enrichment APIs, you'll need to add the necessary fields and mappings within Conductor to process the data correctly. In our example, we will only be mapping the email back as an identifier to ensure data is correctly stitched to the profile, along with a new field called "Ansira UUID," which will hold the UUID for each user.
When altering schema it is always best to consult with your internal technical resources or those available to you from Lytics to ensure everything is configured adequately.



Remembering what stream you decide to use for the mappings is important, as it will be needed when configuring the enrichment workflow.
In the final step, we will bring it all together by configuring our webhook destination to use the auth, template, and audience to enrich a Lytics profile.
This integration leverages our Webhook integration to connect with and retrieve data from Ansira's endpoints. Begin by selecting theWebhooksprovider tile.

Next, select theWebhook User Enrichmentjob type. This webhook job will pass the response of each request to the configured data stream to be mapped back to a user's profile.

Select one or more audiences to enrich with Ansira data. We highly recommend following the suggested approach in theaudienceof this doc to prevent invalid or unnecessary calls to the Ansira API.

Define the stream you'd like the response data passed to. This stream must align with your updated schema and mappings as outlined above.

Select the template that was created in the previous step.
Enter the fullv2/usersendpoint provided by Ansira.

Select profile fields to export. At a minimum, you must select all fields necessary to fulfill your jsonnet template. In our example, this would only beemail.

Finally, determine if you'd like to send all existing audience members to the enrichment endpoint. Selecting this box may send many API requests immediately upon saving your configuration.

BlueKaiis a data management platform owned by Oracle that enables marketing personalization through  audience targeting, optimizing media buys, and improving campaign performance.
Integrating Lytics with BlueKai enables better ad targeting by exporting Lytics audiences enriched with behavioral scores, content affinities, and data-driven insights.
If you haven't already done so, you will need to setup a BlueKai account before you begin this authorization process. Following are the two ways that allows you to export your file on an SFTP server before importing into BlueKai.
If you are new to creating authorizations in Lytics, see theAuthorizationsdocumentation for more information.
For this authorization method, you will need the following credentials: SFTP host name or IP address, port number, username and password for the SFTP server. You may also want to have your partner name (the name that Bluekai recognizes your account with), and the site ID of your Bluekai container. If you have a specific folder you want data loaded into in BlueKai, you should have the full path to it from the root of your SFTP login.
For this authorization method, you will need the following credentials: SFTP host name or IP address, port number, username and private key for the SFTP server. You may also want to have your partner name (the name that Bluekai recognizes your account with), and the site ID of your Bluekai container. If you have a specific folder you want data loaded into in BlueKai, you should have the full path to it from the root of your SFTP login.
Exporting user profiles and audience membership to BlueKai allows you to use behavioral data, content affinities, and insights from Lytics for better ad targeting. Export your audiences to SFTP to stage your files in a compressed, tab-separated value (TSV) format before importing into BlueKai.
This workflow uploads two files in the selected SFTP server: Offline file and Trigger file. In short, the Offline file contains all the exported data about the user, and the Trigger file contains meta information about the Offline file.
We followBlueKai's documentationin creating the Offline file. Data is exported in TSV format with two columns and no header row. Each line in the Offline file represents a unique user. The first column contains the identifier for the user whereas the second column contains the user profile fields that are separated by a pipe "|". An example of an entry in exported file is given below:
some_unique_idfield1=value|field2=value|field3=value*
The Offline file follows thePartner_SiteID_YYYY-MM-DD.gznaming conventions. Lytics collects Partner name and Site ID during theauthorization step.
The Trigger file contains the information about the exported Offline file such as file name, size in bytes and MD5 checksum. This file is used for verification purposes so that all the user data is transferred without any corruption. The Trigger file is created and uploaded only after the Offline file is uploaded. The Trigger file follows thePartner_SiteID_YYYY-MM-DD.gz.triggernaming convention.
Once the job is started, it will:

Paragraphs:
Lytics Customer Data Platform allows you to use real-time customer activity across various channels to trigger Brevo workflows. Instead of a static, list-based approach to automation workflows, Lytics allows you to create dynamic audience segments that sync with Brevo and update in real-time as customers flow in and out of them. For example, a segment of known visitors with an affinity for a certain topic could trigger an email workflow with targeted messaging.
To set up and authorize the Lytics Brevo integration, log into your Lytics account and click on the Data menu tab. Then, click on the Jobs tab. Here, you will see existing jobs and have the option to create a new one.
If you choose to create a new job, you’ll see a list of available integrations organized alphabetically in tiles. Scroll down and click on the Brevo tile.

You will always have two options, toExport Usersfrom Lytics into Brevo or toImport Users & Activityfrom Brevo. Either option will prompt you to setup the integration if it’s your first time. You should see this setup screen after clicking one of the options:

Click on “Create New Authorization” and you’ll be prompted to enter your a label, an API key, and a short description. You can describe your authorization in any way you like. This can be a useful way to tell multiple integrations apart.

The initial account authorization only needs to be performed one time.
Now that the account is authorized, you can begin exporting or importing your users.

In the export scenario, you’ll click on the “Export Audience” button. From there, select the Brevo List that you want to import and the Lytics audience segment that you want to sync them into from the dropdowns.  You should also select the Email field. Finally, you'll want to map each Lytics field to a Brevo field.

By default, the advanced options are set to continuously import and to add users who already exist in the selected Lytics segment.

Finally, click on the “Complete” button located below the advanced options section.

Note: You can export segments by clicking on the Brevo tile within the Integration section of the Data menu tab (as demonstrated above). Alternatively, if you are within the Audience tab, you can also click on a specific segment and then click on the export button in the upper righthand corner to begin the export workflow.

In the Import scenario, you’ll click on the “Import Audiences and Activity Data” button. Next, you’ll select the individual Brevo List(s) that you want to import by clicking on them. As you click on a list it moves from the left column to the right column. You can also click on the blue + and - buttons to do this.

By default, campaign activity data and transactional data will be synced.
In the advanced options tab, you can also specify a certain time of day and timezone for the sync.

Finally, click on the “Complete” button located below the advanced options section

Once import has started a new data stream will be created calledbrevo_users

Integrating Contentful and Lytics allows you to import content from your website, campaign, or custom structured content from Contentful to Lytics to personalize email, web, mobile, or ads content for your customers. This integration utilizes the LyticsContent Affinity Engineto classify Contentful documents and works with LyticsContent Recommendationsto act as the decisioning layer for true one-to-one content personalization.
If you haven't already done so, you will need to setup a Contentful account before you begin the process described below. If you are new to creating authorizations in Lytics, see theAuthorizationsdocumentation for more information.
SelectContentfulfrom the list of providers.
Select theContentful Sign Inmethod for authorization.
When prompted, log in to the Contentful account you wish to authorize and follow the steps per Contentful's instructions.
Enter aLabelto identify your authorization.
(Optional) Enter aDescriptionfor further context on your authorization.
ClickSave Authorization.
You can now use your authorization whensetting up webhooksto import content. You will need the ID of the authorization created, which you can copy from the authorization list:

Configuring webhooks in Contentful will allow you to send content to Lytics when it's published. You can send custom topics through this integration in addition to the standard Lytics topic extraction process using natural language processing. Imported Contentful entries can be included as part ofContent CollectionsandRecommendationsto power marketing campaigns personalized with one-to-one content.
Before you set up webhooks to go to Lytics make sure you've completed the following prerequisites:
If you are not currently using webhooks in Contentful, it may help to read through the Contentful documentation onwebhooksandwebhook transformationto familiarize yourself with these concepts.
Follow these instructions to set up the webhook integration.
Log into yourContentfulaccount.
In the space you wish to configure, clickSettingsand thenWebhooks.
ClickAdd Webhook.
Add a name for your webhook such as "Lytics Content Collection" or something similar.
UnderURL, select thePOSTmethod and enter the following URL:https://api.lytics.io/collect/json/contentful_webhooks
UnderTriggersyou can configure what events the webhook should fire on by selectingSelect specific triggering events. For this integration it is recommended to selectEntryevents onPublish.
Note: Currently this integration only supports content entry ingestion and updates. There is no way to remove, mark as unpublished, or archive entries from Contentful in Lytics, thus these event types are not recommended for use in the webhook.
You can add additional filters such as Environment or Content Types.
Note:If your content types differ vastly in the naming of common fields, you may need to create one webhook per content type as you will need to map individual Contentful fields to Lytics fields.
UnderHeadersyou will need to add two custom headers:

The next time a qualifying event (such as publishing an entry) takes place in Contentful, you should be able to see that document in Lytics.
When constructing the custom payload of your webhook, you will want to include the following fields:
Use the following sample payload as a reference when constructing your own. Be sure to rename your Contentful fields and locales as necessary and omit any fields that don't apply to your content types.
For content fields that have locales you want to send to Lytics, you should include the locale in the field mapping (the above example uses theen-USlocale). The current integration cannot accept multiple locales per field unless you map them separately.
Be sure totest your webhook. If you've mapped anything incorrectly, individual fields may not appear in Lytics as expected.
After you've configured the webhook you should test it to ensure data is being received in Lytics properly. There are some steps you can take in both tools to troubleshoot the webhook.
First you will need to trigger the webhook by taking an action in Contentful.

If your webhook request looks as expected, you can validate the content has synced and is mapped correctly in Lytics:
To ensure data has been received by Lytics, navigate toData > Data Streamsand select thecontentful_contentstream from the drop down. If this stream is not present, Lytics has not received content from Contentful yet.
If raw data is present, you can check that it is being processed by building aContent Collectionsof all your Contentful entries. Navigate toContent > Collections.
SelectNew Collection.
You will use thesoucrefield to build this collection - which contains the ID of the content from Contentful, since it is a non-standard field. You can select theAdvanced Editorfrom the...menu in the Collection editor.
UnderCustom Rulefind and select thesourcefield.
Select theequalsrule and then typecontentfulinto the text box to include all documents received from contentful in the collection. Then clickAdd Condition.
UnderSample Documentson the right side of the editor, you should see a list of Contentful documents that have been imported via the webhook. You can click on one to see the detailed view of the document.
If no sample documents appear this may be because your data is processing. It may take longer to process the first time you receive content from Contentful. If the document does not appear, but you are able to see data in the data stream, contactLytics supportto ensure the content queries for your account are up to date.
Validate that all the fields you expect to see are present and formatted correctly in the document summary.
Documents with a rich text body field will have an additional field, "HTML Body from Contentful Rich Text" which contains the rich text body parsed ad HTML, while the "body" field itself includes plain text.
Back in the advanced collection editor, you may opt to name and save your collection, or use any of the imported fields to further refine your collection for use inContent Recommendations
If you run into issues during any of these steps, feel free to reach out to theLytics support teamfor assistance.

Paragraphs:
Google Ad Manager (also known as DoubleClick for Publishers or DFP), allows you to generate revenue on your website by displaying ads inline with your site's content.
Using Lytics, you can pass the audiences an individual visitor is currently a member of to expand the level of targeting available for any Ad Manager Ad Unit. This may lead to more targeted impressions and higher CTRs.
Lytics identifies your visitor, even if they are anonymous and combines all known information about that particular visitor to improve ad targeting.
The following overview is meant to cover the basics, from a technical JavaScript standpoint. If you are not a developer or are not interested in understanding in detail how the integration will work, please skip toAccount Configurationbelow.
NOTE:Lytics targeting works for all Google Ad Manager tag typesexceptpassback tags.
The first step in targeting Lytics audiences is to configure Ad Manager to recognize them.  This is done by defining custom "key-values".

Now that Ad Manager is configured to recognize Lytics audiences, configure your site to pass that Lytics audience information to Ad Manager using the custom "Key-values" for each visitor.
Install the Lytics JavaScript Tag as described in ourJavaScriptdocumentation.
Install the additional Google Ad Manager integration tag as outlined below.
It is required that his loads AFTER the Lytics JavaScript tag to prevent errors.
Complete the site setup by installing the Google Ad Manager generated tags per their instructions. Remember, for the optimal experience all additional Google generated code should come after the Lytics code above.
For reference, please find a full example of a working installation below:
The following is provided as an example and should not be used in a production environment. Always consult with your web development team to ensure that the configuration is compatible with your specific Google Ad Manager setup. In most cases, tags are not loaded directly on the page but are typically managed through a tag manager. Additionally, it's crucial to avoid loading the same tags in multiple places, as this can lead to unexpected results.
NOTE:In many cases the above code snippets/examples will work out of the box. However, client side JavaScript can vary greatly and the Google Ad Manager's tag can be configured inconsistently.  Due to this, it may be necessary to configure the integration using theadvanced configurationsection below. This commonly resolves flickering, ads not loading, ads loading twice or any other undesired behavior.
The advanced configuration is intended to give your developer(s) access to visitors' profile and/or current audience membership via the Lytics JavaScript tag. This ensures your developer(s) retain complete control on how the Google Ad Manager integration is performed to ensure it is configured optimally based on your unique source code. Please seeTechnical Overviewsection above for a full understanding of how the Ad Manager integration should work at a base level.
Ensure ads will not be initialized before the visitors profile has been retrieved.
Configure Lytics Profile CallbackThe Lytics JavaScript tag makes adding a callback easy. Our fullJavaScriptdocumentation walks you through the process of creating and managing callbacks. Said callback will be responsible for passing the visitors profile data, including audience membership, back to your desired JavaScript function. The following is an example of the callback used in the default Ad Manager integration. You will see it receives thedataobject, verifies that it has audiences and handles the result by either passing them to Google or logging a warning to the console.
Push audience membership to Google Ad ManagerAs shown above, within the callback you will process thedataobject, full details on what is included can befound here, and ultimately passing a list of audience IDs to Ad Manager using their tags APIs.
Initialize AdsLastly, once the audience IDs have been pushed, we leverage thegoogletag.pubads().refresh()call to show the proper ads. This refresh may be unnecessary in your application if you are ensuring the audiences have been pushed before the ads tag has been initialized in the first place.
Next, create your audiences in Lytics. These will be the audiences you will be connecting to "Line Items" within Ad Manager in the final step.
Finally, configure Ad Manager to map Lytics Audiences to Line items.

That's it! Your ads will be targeted to that audience as often as you've set up within Google DFP, which allows ads to be prioritized and rotated.

If you haven't already done so, you will need to set up a Google Cloud Pub/Sub account before you begin the process below. You will use a service account to access your Cloud Pub/Sub data. See Google'sauthentication documentationfor details on the differences between user accounts and service accounts.
To authorize this integration, you will need to authenticate by creating a service account JWT JSON token.
You will need a service account credential file to use this authorization type. If you do not have one, follow the instructions inGoogle's documentationto create one. You will need to give Lytics one of the following roles depending on how you want to configure your workflow:
For importing into Lytics, the following IAM roles need to be added to the service account:
For exporting events to PubSub, you will need the following IAM roles added to the service account:
If you are new to creating authorizations in Lytics, see theAuthorizationsdocumentation for more information.
Importing user and activity data from Cloud Pub/Sub in real-time results in new users or existing user profiles supplemented with activity data. You can use this data to build and refine your existing Lytics audiences to power better, cross-channel campaigns.
The integration is similar to AWS Kinesis Streaming or Azure Event Hubs. It requires you to set up a Cloud Pub/SubTopic, which you publish JSON messages to. Lytics then listens (subscribes) to this Topic and receives those messages.
This integration utilizes theCloud Pub/Sub APImethods of receiving events from a publisher. Specifically we use theGolang library. You are the publisher who sends (publishes) events through a user-created object known as a Topic. Lytics manages an object called a Subscription, which receives the data (events) from the Topic you created. The continuously running job works like this:
Data imported by this job will be sent to a new or existing data stream in your account which you can define as part of the configuration. You will need to map the raw event data into user or content fields. You may reach out toLytics Supportfor assistance with mapping your custom data.
Follow these steps to set up and configure an import of events from Google Cloud Pub/Sub into Lytics. If you are new to creating jobs in Lytics, see theData Sourcesdocumentation for more information.
Exporting user data to Cloud Pub/Sub allows you to receive real-time audience updates from Lytics on a Pub/Sub Topic in your Google Cloud account.
The integration is similar to Webhooks Audience Triggers. You can either create a topic for Lytics to push to, or the integration can be configured to create one automatically.
Once configured, the export job will run as follows:
By default, the integration will populate the data attribute of its Pub/Sub messages with all user fields in a JSON payload of the following format:

You can sync Lytics audiences to Google Analytics and Google Display & Video (DV360) in the Google Marketing Platform.
Google Analyticsis a web analytics service that is part of the Google Marketing Platform. Connect your Google Analytics account to Lytics to run more targeted marketing campaigns based on how your prospects, customers, and other Lytics audiences engage with your website.
Lytics can pass all public audiences as a Custom Dimension to Google Analytics out-of-the-box. This allows for global filters based on Lytics audiences to be applied to reports, custom views and nearly every aspect of your existing Google Analytics account.
Google DV360enables marketers to manage their reservation, programmatic, and programmatic guaranteed campaigns across display, video, TV, audio, and other channels, all in one place. The Google DV360 Export in combination with the latest version of the LyticsJavaScripttag can be used to sync Lytics audiences to DV360.
The Google Analytics Measurement Protocolfor Google Analytics 4 allows users to augment their automatic collection via gtag, Tag Manager, and Google Analytics for Firebase.Export Lytics event streamsoraudiencesvia GA4 Measurement Protocol to tie online to offline behavior, or to send events to Google Analytics that happen outside user-interaction (e.g. offline conversions).
Passing Lytics audiences to Google Analytics requires that the Lytics JavaScript tag be installed on your site. Also, keep in mind that any Lytics audience you would like to access in Google Analytics must beAPI enabled, which Lytics also refers to as "public audiences". This will ensure the JavaScript tag can pass the audience membership to Google Analytics.
If you are new to creating authorizations in Lytics, see theAuthorizationsdocumentation for more information.
To authorize with a GA4 Measurement Protocol API Secret you will need an API secret created in Google Analytics. Your GA4API Secretcan be found in the Google Analytics UI underAdmin > Data Streams > choose your stream > Measurement Protocol > Create. See the GA4documentationfor more information
The Google DV360 export workflow does not require an authorization, as authorization is delegated to the Lytics DMP Google Ads account. In order to export to DV360 successfully, you will need to link your DV360 advertiser account with the Lytics DMP account. This is done in Google DV360 via the process describedhere.
The Google DV360 export workflow requires the DV360 tag sync to be enabled in the Lytics account settings first. Thisconfigurationcan be found in Vault, underSettings > Javascript tag.
GA4, which was first released into beta in 2019, has replaced Universal Analytics (UA) as the default version for Google Analytics installations. GA4 offers a great deal of flexibility and power over its predecessor. The following document outlines the preferred method for enriching GA4 with an individual's profile information, such as audience membership and Lytics user ID.
There are a variety of robust use cases enabled by this integration, most notably the ability to filter GA4 dashboards by Lytics Audiences as well as distribute those audiences efficiently across the Google ecosystem from GA4 directly. Lastly, web properties are complicated by nature. The following recommended approach aims to focus on ease of installation while also preventing a limitation of the power of GA4. Please note that it is always recommended that you consult with your technical teams or partners before proceeding.
If leveraging the workflow to configure new Dimensions on your behalf. Alternatively, custom user-scoped dimensions can be configured manually. Passing the audience membership data or IDs will leverage the profile request API within our JavaScript tag along with the GA4set user_propertiesAPI.
To attribute onsite events such as page views or purchases, you must first define newCustom User Scoped Dimensionsto store the set of audiences and/or User ID depending on preference. This can be done through our server-to-server integration, in which we'll create two properties:Lytics User ID (ly_user_id_dim)andLytics Audiences (ly_segments_dim). Alternatively, because we'll pass the data to Google via JavaScript, you can create whatever dimensions you want by followingGoogle's documentation. If taking the manual approach, just be sure to use theuserscope option during creation. For details on our server-to-server integration please view ourGoogle Analytics: Setup Custom Dimensionsinstructions.
Once the necessary dimensions exist within your preferred Google Analytics account, you'll need to ensure all audiences you would like to send to GA4 are flagged asAPI Enabledfrom the Audience edit area of Lytics. This feature ensures no data is ever shared or passed to another tool without your explicit instructions to do so.
Finally, leveraging the profile listener feature of our JavaScript tag, we'll get details of the current visitor and pass those along to GA4 via your new dimensions. Since there are a nearly infinite number of ways sites can be configured and constructed, it is always best to consult your technical team on this step. Here we'll outline the most common approach assuming that GA4 tag installation default instructions were followed.
A typical installation of GA4 is completed by installing a few lines of JavaScript on your site. Typically in the header or footer.
This will also need to be modified to include the setting of your custom dimensions as well as optionally altering how the initial pageview event is fired. The following example shows ultimately how we'll be sending data to GA4.
To pass the current user's audience information as well as optional user ID, you'll first need to retrieve the profile via our personalization API. Luckily the Lytics tag makes this simple using ourentityready listener. The Lytics tag will call the desired function once it has identified the user and accessed their profile. Using the information returned, we'll send the user properties as outlined above.
We'll alter the default listener example to verify we did receive audience membership data and then pass that along to GA4 as ourlytics_segments_dimdimensions or whatever you named it during the manual creation process.
In this case, we also log a warning to the console when a set of audience memberships are unavailable for debugging purposes. For demonstration purposes, a full HTML example of loading the GA4 tag, Lytics tag, and listener function might look like the following:
At this point, you should successfully pass audience membership to GA4 for each user. Given the flexibility of GA4, there are a variety of configuration options. That said, there are a couple of common points that are worth considering.
The final step of this integration is to followGoogle's recommended approachfor building an audience inside of GA4 using custom dimensions. When prompted which dimension to use, you'll want to select thely_segments_dimor whatever custom parameter you created and then match based on the value of your audience or a regex match. When passing the audiences to GA4, Lytics converts them to astringseparated by commas as Google does not accept arrays. As such, the dimension value will look similar toaudience1,audience2,audience3.
Combining this export job with the latest version of the Lytics JavaScript Tag allows you to create powerful audiences for targeting in Google DV360.
Due to a Google requirement beginning March 1, 2024, the User Consent Confirmed checkbox must be selected for the DV360 Export Audiences workflow to run successfully.
The client-side part of this integration uses the LyticsJavaScripttag (Version 3) and Google DV360 cookie sync to sync visitors to your website. Once a user visits a page of your website where the tag is installed and the DV360 plugin is enabled, the following will happen:
When an export job is created in Lytics, it will do the following:

The Google Analytics Measurement Protocol for Google Analytics 4 allows users to augment their automatic collection via gtag, Tag Manager, and Google Analytics for Firebase. Export Lytics event streams via GA4 Measurement Protocol to tie online to offline behavior, or to send events to Google Analytics that happen outside user-interaction (e.g. offline conversions).
When an export is created, events from the selected streams will be exported via HTTP to Google Analytics, starting from the first event ever received on the stream and continuing in chronological order. Thereafter, events will be sent as received in near real time (note that a small processing delay is expected between when events are received by Lytics and when they are triggered for export in this workflow). Events are formatted using the fields and inputs selected in the job configuration. For more information on GA4 Measurement Protocol payload formatting see theGA4 documentation
The configuration options and fields sent as identifiers depend on theGA4 Versionselected in step 8 of the configuration options below. TheClient IDandMeasurement IDfields are required for exports selectinggtag.js, whileFirebase App IDandApp Instance IDare required for those that selectFirebase.

Paragraphs:
This document assumes that you already have access to a Google Tag Manager(GTM) account and the container you will be using is installed on your web property(s). If not, please refer to theGTM documentationfor getting the tag manager up and running before proceeding.
Note: This will load the Lytics tag on all pages. Feel free to customize the triggering to your liking but it is recommended to place our tag on all pages in order gather the best behavioral data for your visitors.
Once you have published the container your changes should take effect within a few minutes.
Since GTM is a tag manager there are various approaches to sending data related to a users behavior, such as filling out a form or clicking a button, to any number oftagsmanaged by GTM. In the following section we'll cover the basics and give a few examples of common use cases but this is no way covers the gamut of what can be done to collect custom data. It is always best to refer to your account manager and the support team to get recommendations on solving specific data collection challenges.
All of the following examples will assume you understand the basics of creating a newtagof typeCustom HTMLwithin GTM (steps 1 through 6 underInstalling the Latest Lytics Tag), just be sure to name the new tag(s) something descriptive and relative to the action being taken such as "Pass form data to Lytics." In addition, for more information on collecting data with Lytics view our detailedJavaScriptdocumentation.
This contains several pre-built helpers such as listening for clicks on an element with a particular class, ID, etc.
Now that we have configured a trigger to listen for our specific action we can now tie that to a tag that sends Lytics information every time that action takes place.
After you have created a newtagand selected type ofCustom HTMLwe'll configure the data sent and our trigger.
In our example we are going to pass a simple event that sends context of what the user clicked but this could be expanded to be full featured and dynamic. Paste the following snippet into theHTMLtext area:
Under the *Triggeringmenu we'll then select our custom trigger we created in the initial steps.
Save the tag and publish.
Note: When it comes to collecting form data using the built-in GTM helpers is a great place to start. However, it is always best to refer to your Engineering resources to ensure what is being collected is correct, secure, etc. This is merely an example of what can be done rather than the recommended approach. That very much will change based on your unique architecture and use case.
Warning: Never collect/send secure data such as passwords, credit card numbers, etc. via this method.
Now that we have configured a trigger to listen for our specific form submission we can now tie that to a tag that sends Lytics information every time that action takes place.
After you have created a newtagand selected type ofCustom HTMLwe'll configure the data sent and our trigger.
In our example we are going to pass along one of the inputs within the form with the namefirstName. Keep in mind that for your collected data to make it to user profiles the sent data must match what is mapped with LQL. Paste the following snippet into theHTMLtext area:
Under theTriggeringmenu we'll then select our custom trigger we created in the initial steps.
Save the tag and publish.
GTM variables are very useful and make the actual collection of data far simpler though they take a bit of work to configure. In our form example above, instead of using jQuery to get the actual value of inputs those values are already passed to the GTM data layer upon submit. By creating aVariablemapping of that input you can refer to the variable in your tag as opposed to writing more custom JavaScript. Google has somegreat documentationto get you started. Likewise, by searching on Google for things like "collecting form data with GTM" you will get some great step by step walk throughs on how to configure these variables.
The Lytics JavaScript tag is highly customizable. For additional configuration options visit ourJavaScriptdocumentation.

Paragraphs:
Iterableis an integrated, cross-channel platform that supports email, mobile, and web touch points.
Integrating Lytics with Iterable allows you to import user and activity data such as clicks and opens to your Lytics user profiles, or export users based on audience membership in real-time to update lists or trigger timely email or push notifications.
The Lytics Canvas supports Iterable email, SMS, Push, and In-app Experiences. Using the Lytics Canvas you can manage the cross-channel customer lifecycle and use Iterable campaigns as your email and mobile touch points.
Read more on using Iterable with Lytics below. Plus, check out our comprehensivePlaybookand blog,How to increase email conversions with intent based personalization.
If you haven't already done so, you will need to setup an Iterable account before you begin the process described below. You will also need to be a Admin or Super Admin user who canadd or edit API Keysas you will need anIterable API Keyto authorize Lytics to use your Iterable account.
If you are setting upIterable webhooksyou will also need aLytics API token. You can find your API tokens in youraccount settings.
If you are new to creating authorizations in Lytics, see theAuthorizationsdocumentation for more information.

Import Iterable users and activity data to add information such as clicks and opens to your Lytics user profiles. Use that data to build behavioral audiences and refine your targeting.
This integration utilizes theIterable APIsto receive user data. On each run of the job, it will:
In addition to running this job, you can also use webhooks for real-time event capture of your Iterable events. Learn more about how toconfigure webhooksin Iterable to send data to Lytics.

User data will begin to import into Lytics from Iterable and should be available within an hour. IfKeep Updatedwas selected, user data and activity will be updated hourly until the import is cancelled.
This job type will export a Lytics audience to an existing Iterable list or create a new Iterable list. All existing members of that audience are exported to the chosen list and new members are exported in real-time. You can use this export in conjunction with anIterable workflowto send users a triggered Iterable email as they enter an audience in Lytics.
This integration utilizes theIterable APIto send users to the selected list in Iterable. Upon starting, this job will:
By default, Lytics exports the following fields to Iterable:
In addition to the default fields, you can export any Lytics user fields toIterable fieldsthat are present in your Iterable account. Lytics allows you to map user profile fields with the corresponding Iterable field as part of the jobconfiguration.
Follow these steps to set up and configure an export job for Iterable. If you are new to creating jobs in Lytics, see theJobs Dashboarddocumentation for more information.

Users should be available in the Iterable list within a few minutes of starting the export. Larger audiences may take a few hours to be completely added to the list. You can find the new list in Iterable underUsers>Lists.
LyticsExperiencessupport Iterable email, SMS, push, and in-app campaigns. These Experiences may be run as stand-alone campaigns such as newsletters or blast emails. Using the Lytics Canvas, you can manage the cross-channel customer lifecycle and use Iterable campaigns as your email and mobile touchpoints.
Like all Experience enabled providers, you canimport Experiencesfrom Iterable to Lytics. During the import process, you will be asked to select an authorization. Read theIterable authorization documentationfor more information.

During the Experience import process, tactics are determined by theCampaign TypeandMessage Mediumset during the creation of your campaign in Iterable.

Iterable Experiences in Lytics support the following tactics:
The "triggered" Experiences tactics will only work properly if they are set up with aworkflowthrough the Iterable UI. See theactivation detailsfor more information.
After importing an Iterable Experience you can configure it for activation.  All tactics for Iterable Experiences have the same three configuration steps within theExperience Editor:
Once you've finished configuring the Experience you can save and activate it.
For all Iterable Experiences, activating simply pushes users to a list within Iterable. As mentioned in the configuration step, an Iterable Experience functions similarly to theExport Audiences workflow. However, the steps necessary to successfully deploy your campaign vary by the tactic.
For blast Experiences, simply assign the list exported to the associated Iterable Campaign once the list has populated. This should occur within a few minutes of activation if you do not have Delivery Optimization enabled.
For triggered Experiences, you will utilize anIterable workflowto deliver your Experience as users enter or exit the list. You will need to create and configure the workflow before importing the Experience to Lytics, and enable the workflow after the Experience has been activated in Lytics.
Iterable metrics are collected throughwebhooks. You must enable webhooks as described in that doc for Lytics to populate the reach and conversion metrics for Iterable Experiences.

Metrics from the webhooks are mapped to Lytics user fields as follows:
Reach- The followingevent types from Iterablecount as impressions for Iterable campaigns of the appropriate tactic:
Converted- The followingevent types from Iterablecount as conversions for Iterable campaigns of the appropriate tactic:
These events are also mapped to the Lytics user fieldsReached with Iterable ExperienceandConverted on Iterable Experience, which are available in the audience builder so that you can create audiences of users who have been reached by or converted on your Iterable Experiences.

Lytics highly recommends setting up Iterablesystem webhooksfor real time event capture of your events. This will allow Lytics to get real-time activity data such as clicks, opens, bounces etc. on your Iterable campaigns.
Lytics requires that webhooks are enabled to use Iterable Experiences as part of Lytics Orchestrate because it allows for the collection of reporting metrics for your Iterable Experiences.
If you are running a continousimport from Iterableand using webhooks, some user activity data may be captured twice.
To set up system webhooks to go to Lytics, you will need to have a Lytics API token ready, you can read how togenerate a new API tokenif you do not already have one. Then follow these steps:
Log into yourIterable account.
Navigate toIntegrations>System Webhooks.
Click+CREATE WEBHOOK.

In theEndpoint URLbox, enter:https://api.lytics.io/collect/json/iterable?access_token=YOUR_API_TOKENwhereYOUR_API_TOKENis your Lytics API token which can begeneratedin your account settings.

Set theAuth TypetoNoAuthby clicking theNoAuthradio button.
ClickCREATE WEBHOOK.
Then scroll to the far right edge and click theEDITbutton.

Click theEnabledcheckbox.
Select the events you'd like to send data to Lytics by clicking on their respective checkboxs. The available options for Webhook events are:
ClickSAVE.

After saving the changes to the webhook, the selected events will be sent to your Lytics account in real-time. Events collected via the webhook are processed and mapped in the same way that activity data via the import workflow is mapped, reference thefields tablefor a full list of user fields.
You may want to pass a unique Iterable identifier from links within your email to allow cross-channel identity resolution. This will help Lytics identify users across data streams and merge their email with web activity. For more information about dynamically passing this parameter, seeIterable's documentation on creating unique URLs for emails.
The easiest and safest way to pass a unique identifier from Iterable click-through links to Lytics is to encode the user's email with Base64, in Iterable, via the custom link parameters.
The Lytics JavaScript tag must be installed on your site, and the LyticsImport Audiences and Activitywill need to be active withemailset for import (default state). In addition, a line of LQL (Lytics Query Language) will need to be added to the Iterable data mapping file in order to decode and map the email field to the user's profile. For assistance contact your Lytics representative orLytics support.
Follow these steps to add a Base64 encoded email as an identifier to your email links in Iterable.
Now all email clicks will pass theencoded_emailto your website when users click the links, and Lytics will automatically grab the encoded_email, decode it and stitch it to the user's web behavior via our JavaScript web tag.

Paragraphs:
The following document outlines the recommended pattern for ensuring all information collected via Jebbit can be associated with the fully resolved C360 profiles built and managed by Lytics. This document will cover the core mechanics of what is happening and instructions on achieving an initial implementation.
It is always recommended that you consult with the technical resources responsible for managing your web properties to ensure no existing implementations or usecases are negatively impacted by added additional code via tag manager or directly to your code base.
Pulling this use case together requires the following three milestones:
Identify the end user during a website visit.
Hand off the identity information, Lytics _uid, to Jebbit to leverage inside of their managed properties.
Complete the survey or other Jebbit-managed interaction.
Deliver all interaction data back to Lytics to be associated with the origin user's profile.
Identifying the visitor is simple and comes out of the box as part of the installation of ourJavascript SDK. By installing this tag, we'll automatically place a first-party cookie on the visitor's device specific to Lytics. This cookie contains the Lytics_uid, which enables associating interactions across your site with a single C360 profile.
In our handoff to Jebbit below, we'll leverage one of the many available utilities to access and deliver this value per Jebbits preferred method.
There are several ways that Jebbit can be leveraged. This document outlines the recommended path for using an iFrame embed for your Jebbit Experiences. If you are using an alternate method, consult the Jebbit documentation. However, a similar approach can be used across all Jebbit launch methods.
From the Jebbit UI, navigate to your desired experience. Along the top, you'll see a navigation option for "launch." This is where you'll access the source code and configuration options for the iFrame launch method.
To the right of the code snippet, you'll find a toggle for "User ID," as shown below. Ensure that this is enabled, as it allows the Lytics _uid to be passed to Jebbit and associated with all tracked interactions.

Finally, place the Jebbit snippet on your website as you usually would. No additional actions are necessary specific to Lytics. Further details on Jebbit's iFrame Experience launch configuration can be foundhere.
Feeding interaction data back to Lytics in near real-time is always recommended. This is made possible via the Jebbit to Lytics integration. This integration leverages a webhook that passes data to a unique data stream for mapping into the profile.
Both webhooks and the Lytics integration require assistance from the Jebbit team to configure and will require a validaccess tokenalong with the name of your desired stream. Stream definition is entirely up to you, but we recommendjebbit_activityto take advantage of a set of pre-defined mappings.
Though any role with the ability to create and manage data sources will work without an issue, we recommend creating a token with theData Managerprivilege exclusively for this integration. This reduces any risk of granting unnecessary access.
As a result of a properly configured connection, you'll have access to all interaction data collected via Jebbit, which in most cases looks similar to the following:
The last step in the process is to dynamically update the iFrame url to include the visitors Lytics _uid. There are several ways to do this, depending on the tools and resources at your disposal. Below you'll find one example and a description of what is happening. Please review this code in its entirety with your development partners to ensure there is no chance of an unintended conflict with your source code.
The following snippet requires the Lytics JavaScript tag to be present on your site before it can be called. Failing to ensure that load order will result in a JS error due tojstagbeing undefined.
Out of the box, the Lytics JavaScript SDK provides an asynchronous"getid" function. This is used to retrieve the visitor's current_uid. To leverage this function, the core Lytics SDK must already be present. Otherwise, a JavaScript error will occur.
In the example below, we leverage this function to find the current "src" definition for the Jebbit iFrame.An assumption is made that only 1 Jebbit iFrame is present on the page and that it leverages a class of "jebbit-iFrame."If this is false, the querySelector on line 4 must be altered to match your implementation.
We then leverage a simple query add or update function to determine if the src already contains a uid. If it does, we'll update and if not we'll append a new query param to the src, which includes the uid, as per Jebbit's preferred method and documentation.
Example
In most cases, the above example can be dropped into your preferred tag manager alongside the core Lytics JavaScript SDK.
Upon completing the above configuration a test can be performed for a published Jebbit Experience. Simply visit the test site where the Lytics tag and Jebbit iFrame are present. Complete the survey and verify data is being updated in the defined Lytics stream. In our testing, it can take several minutes for the form data to populate in Jebbit and be subsequently passed to the Lytics platform.

Paragraphs:
LiveRampis an identity resolution platform that provides data onboarding and connectivity services. It connects campaign exposure data, offline purchase data, and third-party data at the consumer level to help create a unified view of customer activity.
Integrating Lytics with LiveRamp lets you leverage Lytics insights, behavioral data, and content affinities with LiveRamp's identity resolution to better understand and target your consumers.
Before starting a workflow, it's important to understand the terminology differences of “audiences” and "segments" between LiveRamp and Lytics:
LiveRamp“audiences” are a collection of users included for cross-device identity resolution. The corresponding concept in Lytics is the file being exported from Lytics into LiveRamp.
Lytics“audiences” are sent as attributes (columns) within the file exported to a single LiveRamp audience. Each Lytics audience inside a file will become a “segment” in LiveRamp.
If you haven't already done so, you will need to setup a LiveRamp account before you begin the process described below. There are additional configuration steps that will need to be done in LiveRamp before the exported file can be fully processed. Reach out to your technical point of contact at LiveRamp to complete this configuration.
If you are new to creating authorizations in Lytics, see theAuthorizationsdocumentation for more information.
Follow the steps below if you want to drop the file in a S3 bucket before importing into LiveRamp.
Follow the steps below if you want to drop the file on an SFTP server before importing into LiveRamp.
Exporting user profiles and audience membership to LiveRamp allows you use behavioral data, content affinities, and insights from Lytics combined with LiveRamp's identity resolution to fine-tune your targeting. Export your audience to S3 in a LiveRamp CSV format. Use S3 to stage your files before importing into LiveRamp.
Data is exported as aCSV with a header row. The columns are an identifier field in the first column, followed by user profile fields, followed by audience membership. Audience membership is represented by columns containing the digit 1 if the user is a member of that audience and blank if not. Headers for the audience membership columns are the audience slugs.
This integration operates by creating a CSV file in S3 to be imported by LiveRamp. Once started, the integration will:
It usually takes 1-2 days for a file to fully process into LiveRamp, another 1-2 days to distribute that audience to ad platforms, then another 1-2 days for statistics on match rates to be available in the LiveRamp UI. So, for a first time setup end-to-end, it can take about a week.

Exporting user profiles and audience membership to LiveRamp allows you to use behavioral data, content affinities, and insights from Lytics combined with LiveRamp's identity resolution to fine-tune your targeting.Export your audience to an SFTP server in a LiveRamp CSV EU format. Use SFTP to stage your files before importing into LiveRamp.
This job exports the user profiles as a CSV file. The CSV file format is specific and follows the Liveramp EU CSV format. The number of User Fields that will be exported is limited. We also append an audience column which will contain the Lytics audience name or slug the user is part of and can beconfigured.
This integration once started it will:
We follow the Liveramp SFTP file format to create the SFTP file. Following table shows the fields that can be mapped and exported. By default, none of the below fields are mapped except for Customer ID which will be filled by the Unique Identifier. Note that you can customize the Lytics source fields as part of the jobconfiguration.

Upload user identifier like RampID, Cookie ID or Mobile ID to leverage LiveRamp's Identity Resolution to improve the ads campaign.
This job exports the identifiers as a CSV file. The CSV file format is specific and follows the LiveRamp'sfile format. The csv file will have two columns: one for the identifier and the other for the Lytics audience name that the user is part of. In the case of multi audience export, multiple lines (one for each audience) are added for the user if the user is part of multiple audience.
Once the integration is started it will:
By default, Lytics will export the user identifier and audience membership to LiveRamp. Note that you can customize the Lytics source fields as part of the jobconfiguration:

Enrich Lytics users to addRampIDto their user profile. Use this RampID to identify consumers to target with more relevant ad campaigns.
This integration uses theLiveRamp APIto acquire the RampID for the envelope belonging to the user. Please refer to the documentation onRamp IDsto learn more about it.
Each job run will proceed as follows:
Once the ID is enriched, it is refreshed whenever the envelope ID is changed.
The following fields are included in the default mapping of theliveramp_id_enrichstream:
Follow these steps to set up and configure an enrich job for Liveramp in the Lytics platform.
Associate a Lytics profile with a LiveRamp encrypted envelope as a means to power theLiveRamp RampID Enrichmentintegration. This approach should be leveraged only when a known identifier is present such as email.
Ensure that your website is already configured with the LiveRamp ATS tag. Implementation of this tag is outside of the pervue of Lytics but is a requirement to collect and send the envelope from your customer's browser to Lytics.
Option 1 for implementation is recommended. This option leverages an event listener to send ATS envelope information to Lytics as soon as it is received from ATS. Additional information about this approach is available inLiveRamps documentation.
Option 2 for implementation is focused on sending data to Lytics if you are confident that an ATS-managed envelope will already be in place when the page loads. It is always best to consult with your web development team to ensure that suggested implementation patterns are compatible with your environment(s).
Regardless of the implementation option, adding additional context may be beneficial. For instance, you can incorporate a variable into the payload to track a specific LiveRamp envelope originating from ATS. As illustrated below, for any envelope sourced from ATS, the event will include a variable named _e holding the value "ATS_AUTHENTICATED." This variable can subsequently be utilized for mapping profiles, reporting, data analysis, and more.
Associate a Lytics profile with a LiveRamp encrypted envelope as a means to power theLiveRamp RampID Enrichmentintegration. This approach should be leveraged when there is no known identifier present.
Upon completion, a tracking pixel will be initialized to a LiveRamp domain (we'll cover this in step 2). LiveRamp will associate the anonymous _uid from Lytics with their Ramp Envelope and return that association to an API endpoint at Lytics. To get started, we must ensure that LiveRamp sends the link data to the proper Lytics endpoint and your account is configured to receive and associate that data with user profiles.
(Required)Provide proper URL to the LiveRamp team for forwarding RTIS pixel call to (Manged in LiveRamp).
(Optional)Stream configurationBy default, all link data will be delivered to theliveramp_idldata stream. If you would like this data to be delivered to an alternate stream, you can configure the account settingliveramp_idl_streamto point to your desired stream.
(Required)Map link data to your user profiles.For each identity that is linked, the configured stream will receive the following key/value pairs:
RTIS leverages acookie syncintegration between Lytics and LiveRamp. Below is an example implementation. It is always best to consult your web development team to ensure the proper checks and balances are in place to prevent unplanned errors and impacts on site traffic based on your unique environment.
Theliveramp_pixel_urlwill be provided by the LiveRamp team and generally will look similar to the followinghttps://id.rlcdn.com/xxxxxxxx.gif.

The following fields are included in the default mapping of thelocalytics_profilesstream:
Follow these steps to set up and configure an import job for Localytics in the Lytics platform. If you are new to creating jobs in Lytics, see theData Sourcesdocumentation for more information.
Profile data should appear in thelocalytics_profilestream within an hour, and the mapped user fields above will be added to the user profiles as new profile data is imported.
Trigger push notifications through Localytics when users enter a Lytics audience.
This integration utilizes theLocalytics Push APIto send push notifications to Localytics users. As new users enter a Lytics audience who have a Localytics ID, a push notification will be triggered via Localytics.
By default, Lytics exports the following fields to Localytics. Other user fields can be sent using the templating explainedbelow.
Follow these steps to set up and configure triggered push notifications job to Localytics in the Lytics platform. If you are new to creating jobs in Lytics, see theDestinationsdocumentation for more information.
User profile fields can be dynamically inserted into an alert using templating of supported fields. The Localytics fields including the alert title, alert subtitle, and alert body fields. For template examples and details on how to find available user fields, see theTemplatingsection.
Send Lytics audiences and user fields to Localytics to refine your targeting and improve engagement on your mobile marketing campaigns through Localytics. All existing members and new members of your selected Lytics audiences will be exported in real-time.
This integration utilizes theLocalytics Profile APIto create/update Localytics profiles. Once initiated, the workflow will:
Creating or updating a Localytics profile is done using theProfile ID Fieldwhich can beconfiguredwhen setting up this workflow. If the Lytics user with selectedProfile ID Fielddoes not exist in Localytics, then Lytics will create a Localytics profile with that ID and fill their attributes with the ones selected in the workflow.
If the user being exported to Localytics already exists, then Lytics will update its attribute. The attribute values will be overwritten except for thelytics_audiencesattribute. The update will happen only for the attributes that are selected duringconfiguration. If the Localytics user has other attributes which are not in the workflow configuration, then those attributes will remain unchanged in Localytics.
For each user entering the audience, it will also create/update thelytics_audiencesset attribute for the profile with the slug of Lytics audiences that the user is in. If this attribute already exists, Lytics will update its value depending on enter/exit, not overwrite it. For each user exiting the audience, the workflow will remove the Lytics audience slug from thelytics_audiencesattribute of Localytics profile for that exit event.
You can export any Lytics user fields toLocalyticsas profile attributes. Lytics allows you to select user fields as part of the workflow configuration described below.
Follow these steps to set up and configure an export job for Localytics in the Lytics platform. If you are new to creating jobs in Lytics, see theJobs Dashboarddocumentation for more information.

Mailchimpis a marketing platform for email campaigns including audience segmentation, content templates, reporting and more.
Integrating Lytics with Mailchimp allows you to import email and other user activity data (such as opens and clicks) or export Lytics' cross-channel, behavioral-driven audiences to build and send personalized marketing campaigns from Mailchimp.
The Lytics Canvas supports Mailchimp Experiences. Use Lytics to enrich your Mailchimp user lists with cross-channel data, behavioral scores, and content affinities to improve campaign engagement and performance.
If you haven't already done so, you will need to set up aMailchimp accountbefore you begin the process described below.
If you are new to creating authorizations in Lytics, see theAuthorizationsdocumentation for more information.
Importing user and activity data from Mailchimp results in new users or existing user profiles supplemented with Mailchimp campaign data. You can use this data to build and refine your existing Lytics audiences to power better, cross-channel campaigns.
This integration utilizesMailchimp APIsto receive user and activity data. On each run of the job, it will:

The following fields are included in the default mapping. Custom fields are not exported to Mailchimp.
Follow these steps to set up and configure an export job for Mailchimp in the Lytics platform. If you are new to creating jobs in Lytics, see theDestinationsdocumentation for more information.
Lytics Experiencessupport Mailchimp campaigns and automations. These Experiences can be run as stand-alone campaigns or, using the Lytics Canvas, you can manage the cross-channel customer lifecycle utilizing Mailchimp campaigns as the email touchpoint.
Like all Experience enabled providers, you canimport Experiencesfrom Mailchimp. During the import process, you will be asked to select an authorization. Read theMailchimp authorization documentationfor more information.

If you're not seeing the emails you would like to import on this list make sure that it is a Campaign or Automation created of one of theeligible types. If you would like toactivateyour Experience with Lytics, you may want to create a new Campaign or Automation and save it in a draft state before selecting targeting details.
Tactics are determined by whether or not the email in Mailchimp is aCampaignorAutomationand further by the type of automation.  Mailchimp Experiences in Lytics support the following tactics:
Note:TheEmail on List Addtactic applies to Mailchimp automations of theWelcome new subscriberstype, and theEmail on Tag Addtactic applies to automations of theEmail subscribers when they're taggedtype.
After importing a Mailchimp Experience you can configure it for activation. All Mailchimp Experiences have the same three configuration steps within theExperience Editor:
Once you've finished configuring the Experience you can save and activate it.
Activating a Mailchimp Experience exports Lytics users to the associated Mailchimp list. Once the export from Lytics has populated in Mailchimp, it can be used for targeting in your Campaign. The export should complete within a few minutes of activation. If you haveDelivery Optimizationenabled, users will export at the optimal delivery time at which point the list will be created in Mailchimp.
Once an Experience with the Campaign tactic has been activated in Lytics, follow these steps to finalize your email in Mailchimp:

Marketois a marketing automation software that provides inbound marketing, social marketing, CRM, and other related services.
Connect Marketo and Lytics to import Marketo's robust lead information, including profile and activity data, into Lytics. You can also export Lytics audiences enriched with cross-channel data and behavioral scoring to Marketo.
This integration allows you to give high-value prospects a more targeted experience, follow up on unresponsive leads with a Facebook ad, or make your media spend more efficient by removing leads that you already have from lead generation activities.
If you haven't already done so, you will need to set up a Marketo account before you begin the process described below. Create a newAPI userin Marketo. You will need your Client ID, Client Secret, and the portion of Marketo's Endpoint after://and before/restfor the REST URL.
If you are new to creating authorizations in Lytics, see theAuthorizations Dashboarddocumentation for more information.
Import leads and activity data from Marketo for use in Lytics audiences.
This integration utilizesMarketo's REST APIto import user data. Once the import is started the job will:

The following fields are included in the default mapping of themo_activitystream:
Follow these steps to set up an import leads and activities job for Marketo. If you are new to creating jobs in Lytics, see theData Sourcesdocumentation for more information.
Lytics uses theMarketo Bulk API, which allows an import of activity and leads data via large CSV files. However, Marketo restricts the amount of data Lytics can import daily. The default value of this limit is 500 MB per day.
For example, if your Marketo account generates a 700 MB file whileimporting leads and activities, the first 500 MB will be imported the first day and the remaining 200 MB will be imported when the daily limit resets on the following day.
If daily updates are critical for your use cases, spikes in activity volume may affect how timely Lytics can import data. In such scenarios, you can increase the daily limits for your Marketo account by contacting yourMarketo customer success manager.
When data is imported from Marketo, it is queried with one of the fields:
NOTE: Importing based onupdateAtis preferred so that any new changes are received. However,updatedAtis not available as a filtering field for all Marketo accounts. IfcreatedAtis the only filter field available, this means that any updates made to existing leadswill notbe reflected in Lytics. See Marketo's documentation regardingBulk Lead Extract Filtersand contact their support to discuss gaining access to theupdateAtfilter.
Export Lytics audiences to Marketo to refine your targeting and personalization efforts for high-value prospects.
This integration utilizes theMarketo REST APIto send user data. Once the export is started the job will:
You can export any Lytics user fields toMarketo Lead Fields. Lytics allows you to select user fields as part of the workflow configuration described below.

Meta Ads Manageris a powerful ad management tool that is designed for advertisers of any experience level. Using Meta Ads Manager, you can run ads on Facebook, Instagram, or Messenger.
Connect Meta Ads with Lytics to access predictive user audiences in your Meta Ads Manager. You can use your rich, behavioral-driven audiences as the target for your ads, or build lookalikes off of these audiences to reach more users who are likely to engage with your brand.
Using theLytics Canvas, you can manage the cross-channel customer lifecycle and use Meta ad sets as your advertising touchpoint.
If you have not already done so, you will need to set up a Meta Ads Manager account before you begin the process described below. If you are new to creating authorizations in Lytics, see theAuthorizations Dashboarddocumentation for more information.
Note:Regardless of authorization type, before you can build a custom audience in Meta, you must agree to theMeta Custom Audience Terms of Service.
Authorizing as a Meta user will guide you through an Oauth process to authorize access to ad accounts tied to that particular Facebook user. Using Oauth is fast and simple, but can be prone to failure in the long run as authorizations can be canceled if the user changes their password, leaves the organization, and some other authorization invalidating event.
Authorizing with a Business Manager System is not tied to a specific user, so it is more reliable in the long-term than the User Oauth, and is valid until revoked in the Business Manager settings. This is therecommended authenticationmethod if possible.
Before creating a system user, your Meta Business Manager must:
Once you satisfy these requirements, complete the following steps to set up your authorization:
Sync your Lytics audiences with Meta custom audience lists to target those users in the Meta Ads platform.
This integration utilizes theMeta Marketing APIsto send user data. Once the export is started the job will:
By default, Lytics exports the following fields to Meta. Many of these fields areconfigurable.
Follow these steps to set up an Export Audiences job for Meta. If you are new to creating jobs in Lytics, see theJobs Dashboarddocumentation for more information.
The custom audience should appear immediately in Meta Ads. When you begin syncing audiences, it may take some time for them to process within Meta.
Immediately after export, in the Meta UI you will see a size ofBelow 1000and under this you may see the wordPopulating. Even if the audience is much larger than 1000 users, Meta will always sayBelow 1000if it isPopulating. Meta says about this state:
Audience Is Populating
We're finding people who fit your audience criteria. You can start running ads with this audience right away, but be aware that your audience size will increase as the audience is populated.

This process may take a number of days to complete.
If the exported audience has a lot of activity, such as an audience that has users enter/exit every hour, then the Meta status mayalwayssay "Populating" since the job is continually sending new data to Meta. If you would like to see the current side of the audience in the Meta UI, the only way is to pause the job in Lytics on theJob Summarypage for that job.
Once you've seen the audience size and want to continue adding users, you can unpause the job on the same page by clickingResume. After resuming, the audience size may go back into the "Populating" and "Below 1000" state.
In addition to the size shown, in the Meta UI, you can click through to the audience and see theCustom audience updatedmessages on the History tab to see the batches of users that were sent to Meta.
Target people who visit your website using the Meta Pixel. Create audience definitions powered by Lytics that can be used as custom website audiences or lookalike audiences in Meta Ads.
The client-side part of this integration uses the LyticsJavaScript TagandMeta Pixelto sync users who are members ofAPI enabled Lytics audiences. This will include anonymous users where theexport custom audienceintegration can only sync known users.
Once a user visits a page of your website where both tags are installed, the following will happen:
Since Lytics tag sends users as they are matched during web site visits, the audience will usually be smaller then what you see in the UI. A troubleshooting step for user verification would be to create an audience with web_visitor last visit within a specific recent time window (e.g. last 30 days).
The server-side workflow of this integration uses theMeta Marketing APIto create custom website audiences in Meta that are populated by the users synced through the client-side integration. After running the job:
Lytics does not send any fields to Meta as part of this integration beyond the event field necessary for recording audience membership. The job only creates audience definitions in Meta Ads that can be used for targeting.
Follow these steps to set up and configure the job to create Meta website custom audience definitions in the Lytics platform.
If you haven't done so already, add the Meta Pixel to your website. See Meta documentation for assistanceadding the Meta Pixelandadding the Meta Pixel using Google Tag Manager.
Also ensure that theLytics JavaScript taghas been installed. This integration needs both tags present to work properly.
Once you have added the tag and pixel to your site,enable API accessfor the Lytics audience(s) you would like to target.
You can verify that Meta is receiving Lytics audience membership via events. Use theMeta Pixel HelperChrome extension to help verify this:
Proceed with the job steps below to make this user data available for targeting in Meta.
You should now see the website custom audiences in Meta Ads. They may already be populated if your audience was previously API enabled, or they may need time to populate as users visit your website. You can also build a lookalike audience with Lytics and Meta based on these users.
Send Lytics Audience events to theMeta Conversion APIto improve your ad campaign performance.
This integration uses theMeta Conversion APIto send the Lytics audiences events. Once the job is started, it will:
You can send Lytics user fields to Meta's Conversion API ascustom data parameters. You can also send the Lytics audience membership to Meta. An example of the payload that is sent to Meta Conversion API is:
Follow these steps to set up and configure an Export Audiences to Conversion API job for Metak. If you are new to creating jobs in Lytics, see theDestinationsdocumentation for more information.
LyticsExperiencessupport Meta Ad sets that can be run as stand-alone ad campaigns or as a part of your cross-channel customer life-cycle. Using the Lytics Canvas, you can activate Meta ads with Lytics audiences to re-engage and entice users to convert.
Like all Experience enabled providers, you canimport Experiencesfrom Meta to Lytics. During the import process, you will be asked to select an authorization. Read theMeta authorization documentationfor more information.
Before you can import, you will also need to select your Meta Ads Account ID since the authorization you select may be associated with multiple ad manager accounts.
Once you've selected an ad manager account, you can import eligible ad sets as Lytics Experiences.

During the Experience import process, tactics are determined by theOptimization Goalset during the creation of your ad set in Meta.

Meta Experiences in Lytics support the following tactics:
Ad Recall Lift- Optimize for people more likely to remember seeing your ads.
App Installs- Optimize for people more likely to install your app.
App Downloads- Optimize for app downloads.
Brand Awareness- Optimize to reach the most number of users who are likely to spend at least a minimum amount of time on the image or video.
Engaged Users- Optimize for people more likely to take a particular action in your app.
Event Responses- Optimize for people more likely to attend your event.
Impressions- Show the ads as many times as possible.
Landing Page Views- Optimize for page views.
Lead Generation- Optimize for people more likely to fill out a lead generation form.
Link Clicks- Optimize for people more likely to click on the link of the ad.
Offer Claims- Optimize for people more likely to claim the offer.
Offsite Conversions- Optimize for people more likely to make a conversion on the site.
Page Engagement- Optimize for people more likely to engage with your page.
Page Likes- Optimize for people more likely to like your page.
Post Engagement- Optimize for people more likely to engage with your post.
Reach- Optimize to reach the most unique users each day.
Social Impressions- Increase the number of impressions with social context, i.e. with the names of one or more of the user's friends attached to the ad who have already liked the page or installed the app.
Video Views- Optimize for people more likely to watch videos.
After importing a Meta Experience you can configure it for activation. All tactics for Meta have the same three configuration steps within theExperience Editor:
Target- select the target audience for your Experience.
Configure Meta- set up how the audience for your Experience will be exported. There are two different methods for syncing audiences to Meta based on the type of audience.
The configuration step will generally function the same as the respective workflow chosen, but without theAudienceselection, as that is configured by the Target step in the Experience editor.
Configure Delivery- choose to turn the Delivery Optimization feature on or off. Turning on Delivery Optimization means that known users will not be synced to a Meta audience immediately, but instead will wait to sync individual users based on the time that they are most likely to respond to an ad. Depending on the cost metric for your ad, Delivery Optimization may help you save ad spend and see a higher conversion rate.
Once you've finished configuring the Experience, you can save and activate it.
For all Meta Experiences, activating simply pushes users to an audience within Meta. As mentioned in the configuration step, a Meta Experience functions similarly to theExport Audienceworkflow. However, there are additional steps necessary to use your new audience with the ad set you imported.
Note:It may take some time for audiences to process and be ready to use in an ad set. Read theExport Audiencedocumentation for further information.
There is a workflow that runs in the background to collect aggregate metrics for your Meta Experience metrics. This metrics workflow runs hourly and uses theMeta Insights APIto query for conversions and reach.

Currently, only conversion events have user attribution for Meta Experiences, and there is someadditional setupnecessary to make this work for your ad set. Once configured it means that there is a user field in Lytics which records the click events from an ad set but there is no way of tracking impressions at the user level. The Meta Insight API merely returns an aggregate number based on the event.
Lytics metrics are recorded using the followingfieldsto query against the Meta Insights API:
Reach:reachThe number of people who saw your ads at least once. Reach is different from impressions, which may include multiple views of your ads by the same people. This metric is estimated.
Converted:unique_clicksThe number of people who performed a click (all). This metric is estimated.
Conversion Rate:unique_ctrThe percentage of people who saw your ad and performed a unique click (all). This metric is estimated.
As mentioned above, Lytics brings in the conversion count for a Meta Experience directly from the Meta API. You can also begin to track click-throughs byadding custom UTM parameters. Follow these steps to configure these custom parameters using Lytics, and you may also refer to theMeta documentationfor URL parameters.
While editing your ad in Meta, locate theTrackingsection, and underURL Parametersclick onBuild a URL Parameter.
It is recommended you fill out the default campaign UTM tracking variables, as Lytics will automatically capture these query parameters when users visit your website.
UnderCustom Parameterscreate the following new parameters:
This dynamic value will be populated with the ID of the ad set so that Lytics will recognize which Experience the user clicked on.

ClickApplyto save the changes to your URL parameters.
ClickPublishto save the changes to your ad.
After you've added these parameters and users begin clicking on your ad, you should see values populating theUTM conversions user fieldin Lytics.

MicrosoftAzureis a Cloud Computing Platform that provides a range of services such as Databases, Mobile, Networking, Security, Storage, Web, Windows Virtual Desktop and more.
Connect Lytics to Microsoft Azure Storage, Event Hub, and Azure SQL to import and export data from Lytics. This allows you to leverage Lytics behavioral scores, content affinities, and insights to drive your marketing efforts through Azure.
If you haven’t already done so, you will need to setup aMicrosoft Azure accountbefore you begin the process described below. If you are new to creating authorizations in Lytics, see theAuthorizationsdocumentation for more information.
Use the Microsoft Azure Storage Connection String to import or export files to and from Azure Blob storage. Please refer toAzure's documentationto setup the connection string for the Blob storage, and then follow the steps below to connect Lytics with Azure:
Use the Microsoft Azure Event Hub authorization method to export Lytics Audiences to Azure Event Hub. You will need theEvent Hub Connection String. Once obtained, enter the connection string in theEvent Hub Connection Stringbox.
For Azure SQL Database you will need the following credentials. Note that if your Azure SQL server enforces IP firewall rules, you will need to add Lytics production IPs to the allowlist. Please contact your Lytics account manager for a range of IPs.
Importing custom data stored in Azure Blob Storage to Lytics allows you to leverage Insights provided by Lytics data science to drive your marketing efforts.
This integration uses theStorage Service APIto read the CSV file stored in Azure Container. Each run of the job will proceed as follows:
Fields imported via CSV through Azure Storage Service will require custom data mapping.
Follow these steps to set up and configure a CSV Import from Azure Storage in the Lytics platform. If you are new to creating jobs in Lytics, see theData Sourcesdocumentation for more information.
NOTE:For continuous imports, files should be in the following format:timestamp.csv. The job will understand the sequence of files based on the timestamp. If no next file is received, the continuous import will stop and a new export will need to be configured.
Azure SQL Databaseis an intelligent, scalable, relational database service built for the cloud. By connecting Lytics directly to your Azure SQL instance, you can easily import full tables of audience and activity data to  leverage Lytics' segmentation and insights.
This integration ingests data from your Azure SQL Database by directly querying the table selected during configuration. Once started, the job will:
Run a query to select and order the rows that have yet to be imported. If the import is continuous, the job will save the timestamp of the last row seen, and only the most recent data will be imported during future runs. To ensure consistent ordering of records and to improve performance for batch ingestion, the result of this query will be written to a Local Temporary Table of the format#TMP_{UUID}_{TIMESTAMP}, whereUUIDis a unique identifier associated with the job andTIMESTAMPis the unix timestamp marking the start of the current run, in nanoseconds. This table is only visible in the current session, and is automatically dropped when the batch ingestion completes. For more information, see theTemporary Tablessectionhere.
Once the initial query completes, the result set will be imported from the temporary table in batches, starting from the oldest row.
Once the last row is imported, if the job is configured to run continuously, it will sleep until the next run. The time between runs can be selected during configuration.
Fields imported through Azure SQL will require custom data mapping.
Follow these steps to set up and configure an Azure SQL import job for Microsoft Azure in the Lytics platform. If you are new to creating jobs in Lytics, see theData Sourcesdocumentation for more information.

In this case we'll issue a warning if the query returns less than 1 for 5 minutes and a full alert if we see less than 1 for 15 minutes.

We could also create an alert to watch traffic collection which may tell us if there is an issue with the JavaScript tag on a production website. In this case if the value of collection counts falls below one, we know no data is coming into any stream so there is likely an issue.

Paragraphs:
GDPR and CCPA have introduced consumer privacy requirements that are important to understand and have a strategy for.
In online and email marketing, the key regulations that have long influenced targeted advertising to consumers are obtaining consent for contact and the use of tracking cookies. Traditionally, this has been achieved through opt-in mechanisms during account registration for email newsletters or through website footers that disclose the use of cookies.
However, this has dramatically changed with the introduction of new consumer privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). These regulations grant consumers additional rights to comprehend and govern the usage and tracking of their data for marketing and other purposes. These rights are commonly referred to as the Right of Access or Right to Know and the Right of Erasure or Right to Delete. They empower consumers to take actions such as requesting the removal of their personal information or requesting a report detailing the data known about them by the business.
To effectively manage these consumer privacy processes and ensure compliance with GDPR and CCPA requirements, many enterprises leverage the capabilities offered by Lytics and OneTrust. These tools provide valuable automation functionalities that streamline the necessary activities mandated by the regulations. Organizations already using OneTrust Privacy Rights Automation in their privacy compliance workflows can enhance their privacy management efforts and establish a robust framework for safeguarding consumer data by integrating with Lytics APIs to allow real-time compliance.
When it comes to managing cookie consent primarily on the client side, the common approach is to use explicit opt-out methods. One popular tool for cookie consent management is OneTrust. By utilizing OneTrust's cookie consent management, you can configure it to read the consent opt-out and prevent loading any configured tags. This means that the Lytics tag, responsible for sending data downstream and storing cookies client side, will be effectively disabled.
To learn more about OneTrust's cookie consent management, visit their website:OneTrust Cookie Consent.
For configuration purposes the Lytics cookie has flexibility in how is categorized depending on how the cookie is going to be used.
In addition to cookie consent management, Lytics offers a comprehensive platform for managing customer consent. Integrating Lytics with OneTrust can elevate your customer consent management to new heights. Lytics enables you to gather and handle customer consent data effectively, providing you with actionable insights and enabling personalized experiences while respecting consumer preferences.
To learn how to leverage Lytics for managing customer consent, we have created a dedicated resource:Using Lytics to Manage Customer Consent. This guide will walk you through the process of utilizing Lytics alongside OneTrust to ensure compliance and build stronger customer relationships.
As a consumer in California, you hold certain rights concerning your personal data, including the right to access and request the removal of information stored by companies. OneTrust offers efficient solutions for handling Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs), Data Erasure Requests, and automating privacy rights management.
Data Subject Access Requests can be sent from OneTrust to the LyticsGet User API endpoint. This endpoint requires an API token to authorize the request and the by-field of the profile (typically email address). Any fields on the user profile can be returned and included in the reporting sent back to the consumer.
Requesting the deletion of a consumer profile in Lytics can be triggered through the LyticsDelete User API endpoint. This endpoint again requires an API token to authorize the deletion request, as well as the email address (or other appropriate by-field) of the consumer profile to identify what to delete. This process returns a deletion request ID, which can be used to monitor the process completion. As the deletion involves removals from data archives anywhere else that the data may be retained, this can take up to 14 days in some cases.
Here's an overview of how OneTrust handles DSARs:
To further enhance your privacy rights automation and consent management, OneTrust allows you to configure a custom webhook integration with Lytics. This integration enables seamless communication between the two platforms and streamlines the following key functions:
Implementing automation of consumer profile reporting and privacy regulation management should be done with careful consideration of the entire environment and systems which consumer data may be retained or synced from. Timing of syncs between systems, availability of complete data for reporting, and archive retention periods are all important to keep in mind when planning, designing, and implementing these types of automations.

For assistance contact your Lytics representative orLytics support.
For example:
Ensure the Lytics Sailthru importHash Algorithmoption is set to 'SHA-256' (default).
Log in toSailthruand navigate toCommunications > Templatesthen select your email template.
Select theAdvancedtab.

Dividing by two allows you to allot the same number of API calls to the upcoming Salesforce Export.
To roughly estimate how long your initial import will take, use the following formula:
(Total Leads + Total Contacts + Total Opportunities + Total Accounts) / Total Daily API Calls Allowed for Lytics Import
This will yield the approximate number of days that will be required.
Note: this estimate will be slightly low because each time the import encounters an API limit, it sleeps for 24 hours rather than restarting at the same time the following day.

Paragraphs:
Connecting Lytics and Salesforce Data Management Platform (DMP) allows you to use Lytics audiences and behavioral data within the Salesforce DMP ecosystem. This is achieved through a two-step process. First, Lytics uses the Salesforce DMP pixel to send our_uid, or unique web indentifier, to Salesforce DMP linking the user. Next, a CSV with selected Lytics user fields and_uidis exported from Lytics and imported into Salesforce DMP addding additional user attributes and enhancing targeting capabilities.
This article covers:
When a user visits your site the Lytics JavaScript tag will automatically pass the unique_uidto Salesforce DMP. You can confirm that this is happening by searching for the Krux pixel on your site:https://beacon.krxd.net/1x1_usermatch.gif?partner=lytics&partner_uid=<your _uid>
This feature is currently in beta and requires a CSV with a particular format to be generated in order to import data to Salesforce DMP. Though it is possible to export a standard CSV from Lytics and then reformat the CSV using alternative tools we recommend contacting our success team for assistance and further information on this process.
Additional information related to the CSV format.

Salesforce Marketing Cloudis a digital marketing platform that allows you to create and manage marketing relationships and campaigns with customers.
Connecting Lytics and Salesforce Marketing Cloud allows you to export Lytics audience membership to a data extension or trigger an event definition journey in real-time, and receive activity data in Lytics for further segmentation.
TheLytics Canvassupports Salesforce Marketing Cloud Experiences. Using Lytics to enrich user data with cross-channel behavior and content affinities, you can send responsive campaigns through Salesforce Marketing Cloud.
In order to allow Lytics to access your Salesforce Marketing Cloud account, you'll need the following:
To get Salesforce Marketing Cloud client keys, see theMarketing Cloud API Integration guide. Your Salesforce Marketing Cloud client keys will need the following access permissions to work with your Lytics and Marketing Cloud workflows:
If you are new to creating authorizations in Lytics, see theAuthorizationsdocumentation for more information.
Importing subscribers and activity data from Marketing Cloud results in new users or existing user profiles supplemented with Marketing Cloud campaign activity data. You can use this data to build and refine your existing Lytics audiences to power better, cross-channel campaigns.
This integration utilizes both the Marketing Cloud REST and SOAPAPI Integrationto pull in subscriber and event data.
The following fields are included in the default mapping of thesfmc_eventsstream:

Push users into a Marketing Cloud journey when users enter a Lytics audience to send event-driven, responsive campaigns across any channel.
This integration utilizes the REST and SOAPAPI Integrationto push data to a Marketing Cloud journey. When the export is started the job will:
There are two required fields,ContactKeyandEventDefinitionKey, that are selected in configuring the job and sent to the Marketing Cloud journey. Additional Lytics user fields can be mapped to Marketing Cloud journey data fields when setting up the job.
Follow these steps to set up and configure the export to a Marketing Cloud journey in the Lytics platform. If you are new to creating jobs in Lytics, see theDestinationsdocumentation for more information.
This export will run continuously until it is terminated by a user. For every new user that enters the chosen Lytics audience, the selected data will be written to the Marketing Cloud trigger journey data extension within a couple of minutes.
Lytics Experiencessupport Salesforce Marketing Cloud journeys based on your data extensions or triggered API events. These Experiences are best kept as simple email journeys with a single email send action. Any actions beyond the first email send will not be counted in reach and conversion metrics. To manage the full customer lifecycle, you can create multiple Salesforce Marketing Cloud Experiences, each with a single email send, in the Lytics Canvas.
Like all Experience enabled providers, you canimport Experiencesfrom Salesforce Marketing Cloud to Lytics. During the import process, you will be asked to select an authorization. Read theSalesforce Marketing Cloud authorization documentationfor more information.

Tactics are determined by the journey'sentry source.Salesforce Marketing Cloud Experiences in Lytics support the following tactics:
After importing a Salesforce Marketing Cloud Experience you can configure it for activation. All tactics for Salesforce Marketing Cloud have the same three configuration steps within theExperience Editor:
The activation will generally function the same as the export jobs, but with some changes:
Once you've finished configuring the Experience you can save and activate it.
Activating Salesforce Marketing Cloud Experiences will export users and populate a Data Extension, but the exact method depends on the Experience tactic.
The API Event tactic will push users via theTriggered Journey export. The users sent to Salesforce Marketing Cloud will bestored in a data extension.
NOTE:For this tactic, you will activate the Salesforce Marketing Cloud journey before activating the Lytics Experience so that it is ready to process incoming events. If Delivery Optimization is enabled, the API event will be sent at the best time to email the user. No delay should be configured in the Salesforce Marketing Cloud journey between user entry and email send.
The Data Extension tactic will push users via theData Extension export. The Salesforce Marketing Cloud journey will evaluate the Data Extension once the journey is activated.
NOTE:For this tactic, you will activate the Experience in Lytics before activating the journey in Salesforce Marketing Cloud, which gives the export time to populate the Data Extension. Exact timing will depend on your audience size, among other factors.

Salesforce Marketing Cloud metrics are collected through theRetrieve APIto populate thereach and conversion metricsfor Salesforce Marketing Cloud Experiences.

Metrics from the SalesForce Marketing Cloud are mapped to Lytics as follows:
Reach- Impressions are counted by the number of users who have opened the email sent by the Experience. Lytics will retrieve all theOpenEventsfrom Salesforce Marketing Cloud for the Experience.
Converted- Conversions are counted by the number of users who have clicked a link in the email sent by the Experience. Lytics will retrieve all theClickEventsfrom Salesforce Marketing Cloud for the Experience.
These events are also mapped to the Lytics user fieldsReached with SFMC ExperienceandConverted on SFMC Experience, which are available in the audience builder so that you can create audiences of users who have been reached by or converted on your Salesforce Marketing Cloud Experiences.

Paragraphs:
SendGridis a cloud-based transactional email service and email marketing platform.
Integrating Lytics with SendGrid allows you to import email and other user activity data (such as opens and clicks) or export Lytics' cross-channel, behavior-driven audiences to build and send personalized marketing campaigns from SendGrid.
TheLytics Goalssupports SendGrid email Experiences. You can manage the cross-channel customer lifecycle with the Lytics Goals and use SendGrid marketing campaigns as your email touchpoints.
If you haven't already done so, you will need to setup a SendGrid account before you begin the process described below.
To authorize a SendGrid workflow, you must provide a SendGrid API key so Lytics can communicate with SendGrid's APIs to send and receive data from your account. For instructions on how to create an API key, refer toSendGrid's API key documentation.
Importing user and activity data from SendGrid results in new users and/or existing user profiles supplemented with SendGrid campaign activity data. You can use this data to build and refine your existing Lytics audiences to power better, cross-channel campaigns.
This integration utilizes theSendGrid APIsto receive user data. On each run of the job, it will:
If theImport email eventsoption is selected during the configuration process, on the first run of the job it will also:
The following fields are included in the default mapping of thesendgrid_usersstream:
Lytics will import all custom fields from SendGrid, however this stream does not automatically map these fields. If you would like to map the imported custom fields to Lytics user fields, contactcustomer supportfor assistance.
The following fields are included in the default mapping of thesendgrid_activitystream:
Follow these steps to set up and configure an import of SendGrid in the Lytics platform.If you are new to creating jobs in Lytics, see theData Sourcesdocumentation for more information.
Exporting a Lytics audience to SendGrid allows you to send a Single Send email to your users based on your own, relevant targeting criteria, such as: cross-channel behavior, content affinities, and more.
This integration utilizes theSendGrid APIsto send user data. Once the export is started the job will:
The SendGrid segment(s) created by the job will ultimately contain the users from the exported Lytics audience(s). For example, if a Lytics audience named "High Value Users" with the id5cecf2aa79b0a5641920e0607b95c793is exported to SendGrid, you will see a new segment in SendGrid named "High Value Users". The definition of this segment will belytics_segmentscontains5cecf2aa79b0a5641920e0607b95c793.

After a backfill, the job will receive real-time updates when a user enters or exits the audience. For each user to export, regardless if the user is being added as part of the backfill, or they're entering/exiting the audience in realtime, it will:
Thelytics_segmentsfield is automatically populated with the a comma separated list of Lytics audience IDs the user is currently a member of. That is, once a user leaves the audience in Lytics, this field will be updated in SendGrid, and they will be removed from the SendGrid segment. Users will not automatically be removed from your SendGrid account, or the list your segment is on.
By default, Lytics exports the following fields to SendGrid. You can export any Lytics user field to a custom SendGrid field, so long as the field type is astring,intordate. You can customize the Lytics source fields as part of the jobconfiguration.
Note:additionallytics_segmentsfields (with an integer suffix e.g.lytics_segments_1) may be created if the total number of segments exported exceeds the max field size.
Follow these steps to set up and configure an export of users to SendGrid in the Lytics platform.If you are new to creating jobs in Lytics, see theDestinationsdocumentation for more information.
You can use Lytics to trigger a SendGrid transactional email to your customers when they enter a Lytics audience. For example, send a welcome email when a customer moves from unknown to known, or a retention email when a customer becomes disengaged.
The job uses SendGrid'sv3 Mail Send APIto deliver emails with the template you select during configuration. Thus before you can set up this job, you must first have created the dynamic transactional template you will usein your SendGrid account. Each time a user enters the audience selected during configuration, the job will:
The job will then wait for more users to enter the audience, and repeat this process as necessary.
Note:SendGrid's v3 API does not support "Legacy" Transactional Templates, thus they are not supported by this integration. If you have any legacy templates in your SendGrid account, they will not be available to choose from when selecting the template for this job. Please ensure that you first migrate any existing legacy template you may want to use. See SendGrid's legacy template migrationdocumentation here.
As mentioned above, the payload to the SendGrid Mail Send endpoint is populated with the following keys underpersonalizations.dynamic_template_data:
Example email payload:
Follow these steps to set up and configure the SendGrid triggered email export in the Lytics platform. If you are new to creating jobs in Lytics, see theDestinationsdocumentation for more information.

In this integration, you can send Lytics user fields to SendGrid for use in personalizing the email. It's important to design and test your template carefully before setting up this job to ensure your emails will look the way you want them to.
SendGrid dynamic templates support Handlebars syntax for substitution (see SendGrid's docs about using Handlebars here), so you just need to make sure that your template has the right variable name for the Lytics user field that are being sent.
Let's say you want to personalize our email to show a known user's first name in the greeting line. There is a user field, called "First Name" (the slug for which isfirst_name). You can see the slug for the field in parentheses in the "Fields To Include" section when you are configuring the job.
In SendGrid, the template HTML should look something like this (such that the variable name matches the Lytics user field slug exactly):
Importing user and activity data from SendGrid results in new users and/or existing user profiles supplemented with SendGrid campaign activity data. You can use this data to build and refine your existing Lytics audiences to power better, cross-channel campaigns.

Lytics Experiences## Experience Import
Like all Experience enabled providers, you canimport Experiencesfrom SendGrid to Lytics. During the import process, you will be asked to select an authorization. Read theSendGrid authorization documentationfor more information.

SendGrid Experiences in Lytics support the following tactics:
The tactic for an Experience is determined by the type of email created in SendGrid,single send,campaign, ortransactional template. Theimport listis generated using all three of the endpoints in SendGrid.
After importing a SendGrid Experience you can configure it for activation. All tactics for SendGrid Experiences have the same three configuration steps within theExperience Editor:
The activation will generally function the same as the corresponding job, but without theAudienceselection, as that is configured by the Target step in the Experience editor.
Once you've finished configuring the Experience you can save and activate it.
Single SendandLegacy Marketing Campaignactivation pushes users to a SendGrid contact List that you select and creates a segment of users to assign to your campaign, and function similarly to theExport Audiences, and theExport Audiences (Legacy)jobs respectively.Transactional EmailExperiences trigger real-time emails using theExport Audiences (Triggered Emails)job.
When you activate this Experience, users will be pushed to a SendGrid contact list, and a segment will be created for the Experience in SendGrid.
When you activate this Experience, users will be pushed to a legacy contact list in SendGrid, and a segment will be created for the Experience.
After you activate this Experience, emails will automatically begin sending when users enter the audience in Lytics. No further configuration is necessary assuming your HTML template is ready to go. Confirm that emails are sending, you can check yourSendGrid email activity feedonce new users have entered the audience in Lytics.
SendGrid metrics are collected throughwebhooks. You must enable webhooks as described in that doc for Lytics to populate thereach and conversion metricsfor SendGrid Experiences.
Note:If you are already running theImport Audiencesjob, webhooks should automatically be configured to send to Lytics.

Metrics from the SendGrid are mapped to Lytics user fields as follows:
Reach-Open eventsin Sendgrid are mapped to Lytics impressions.
Converted-Click eventsin Sendgrid are mapped to Lytics conversions.
These events are also mapped to the Lytics user fieldsReached with SendGrid ExperienceandConverted on SendGrid Experience, which are available in the audience builder so that you can create audiences of users who have been reached by or converted on your SendGrid Experiences.

Lytics highly recommends setting upSendGrid event notificationsto post event data to the Lytics. This will allow Lytics to get real-time activity data such as clicks, opens, etc. on your marketing campaigns and transactional emails. If you are running theSendGrid Import Audiences, the job will configure webhooks for you. However if you want to set them up manually, or you had previously configured webhooks to send to another system, you may need to update your settings.
Lytics requires that webhooks are enabled to use SendGrid Experiences as part of the Lytics Canvas because it allows for the collection of reporting metrics for your SendGrid Experiences.
To set up event notifications to go to Lytics, you will need to have a Lytics API token ready, you can read how togenerate a new API tokenif you do not already have one. Then follow these steps:
Lytics will then receive real-time event data to thesendgrid_webhooksstream. If you've run theSendGrid Import Audiences job, default mapping is automatically provided. Otherwise, contactLytics supportto add the mappings for SendGrid activity in your account.

This document outlines a solution that isnot managed by Lytics. Please use it at your own discretion.
Note:This solution has not been updated to use the latest version of the Lytics JavaScript tag. Therefore, additional steps are provided to ensure data is stored and accessible using this legacy integration.
Unlock the power of personalization in your CMS! Connecting Lytics to Sitecore enables you to access segments created in Lytics and use them to drive rules in Sitecore's native personalization engine. Lytics combines behavior from your other marketing tools with known user identities to create predictive segments based on how your users interact with your brand. Use your custom segments to create personal and powerful experiences.
The integration setup in Sitecore is simple but requires back-end Sitecore and .NET development experience and access to your site's codebase.
Install Sitecore connector as explainedhere
Once the Sitecore connector is installed, establish content to be personalized in Sitecore's Content Editor and/or xEditor.
Select to use Lytics segments for personalization in the Rule Set Editor, just like you would any other rule.
Select the specific Lytics segment to use as the target segment for personalization.
The above plugin was created and managed by a third party outside of Lytics' control. At the time of writing, it leverages legacy JavaScript tag functionality that is no longer available by default. The following code leverages the modern jstag3 listeners to polyfill thely_segscookie to ensure backward compatibility with the Sitecore module. This must be installed after the core Lytics JavaScript tag and should be installed by a site admin who is aware of the inherent risks and impact of introducing JavaScript code to your web properties.

SurveyMonkeyis an online survey development platform. SurveyMonkey makes it easy to measure and understand feedback so you can drive growth and innovation. SurveyMonkey has a suite of tools for measuring customer satisfaction and customer loyalty, conducting market research, and concept testing.
Integrating Lytics with SurveyMonkey enables you to import content from your surveys, as well as contact information. These insights can help you activate more effective and personalized campaigns.

Lytics recommends the following best practices for collecting identifiers from SurveyMonkey and using your survey data to build audiences in Lytics.
There are three ways to collect identifiers from SurveyMonkey surveys in order of complexity:
This is the easiest to setup. Just followSurveyMonkey's instructionsto send out your survey by email to a list of contacts. The recipient's email address will be included in their responses and will allow them to be merged with their Lytics profile when imported.
This method takes a little more setup, but is much more flexible in delivery options. Your surveys will need to havecustom variablesadded to themand will need to have the user's information inserted into the web link collector's URL. Depending on your delivery method, specific instructions on how to insert identifiers into the web link collector's URL will vary.
TheSurveyMonkey Importwill automatically use thelytics_emailandlytics_uidcustom variables as identifiers.lytics_uidshould be a Lyticsuid. You can export theuidto a tool that sends the survey link, or retrieve the uid from theLytics JavaScript tagto embed or link to the survey from a webpage.lytics_emailshould be the user's email address that is stored in Lytics. Additionalcustom variablescan be used, but will need to bemapped in LQLto be used in Lytics.
This method is the most complicated to configure. It will require specific wording of questions on all surveys you want to track and custom LQL to implement. To implement this method you will need to create a question in your survey to collect an identifier. For example:
You will then need to createcustom LQLto recognize the responses to these questions as identifiers so the responses can be merged into the user's profile. Using the example questions above, the LQL would look something like:
Only questions with the exact wording used in the LQL will be recognized as an identifier, this includes capitalization and punctuation at the end of the question. Using the example LQL above, the following questions would not be recognized as containing an identifier:
This is the only method that works with all SurveyMonkey collector types, but due to the added complexity, we recommend using one of the other methods if possible.
By default, all questions and answers are stored in a map field,question_answer, on the user profile. This can be difficult to use as the map keys will be a truncated version of the question text.
We recommend creatingcustom LQL mappingsfor questions that are relevant to your marketing audiences. Questions and their answers are placed into thesurveymonkey_responsesstream in the fieldquestions_answers. They are stored as a map with the question text as the map key, and the answer as the value.Long questions will be truncated. Questions should be kept as short as possible.
For example, if you wanted to create an audience around users that were planning to retire soon you might have a true/false survey question like:Are you planning to retire in the next year?
This will appear in the Lytics stream as:questions_answers.Are you planning to retire in the next year?
This can be difficult to use in an audience definition, so we suggest remapping it using LQL like:
This would remap the response to the user fieldretire_next_yearfor use in Lytics audiences.

Match identifiers from theLytics JavaScript tagwith Taboola IDs to expand user profile data and enable the Taboola audience export within Lytics.
When the integration is enabled, anytime a user visits your website where the Lytics JavaScript tag is active, the tag will initiate a request to theTaboola pixelcontaining the Lytics cookie ID. In response, this endpoint will redirect to a Lytics collector endpoint containing the Taboola ID for that user. This ID is recorded through thetabooladata stream in Lytics.
The following fields are included in the default mapping of thetaboolastream:
You may need tocontact Lytics supportto add these field mappings to your account if you have not run theCSV exportyet.

The cookie sync needs time to sync users with Taboola and populate profiles in your Lytics account with Taboola IDs. The S3 export will only send users that have been captured by the cookie sync and that have a valid Taboola ID on their profile. It is recommended to turn on the cookie sync at least a week prior to sending audiences via theS3 export.
Follow these steps to verify the successful setup of the integration in your browser.
For additional assistance in testing or troubleshooting the integration, feel free to reach out toLytics support.
Export Lytics audiences to Taboola to reach the most relevant users with your Taboola ads.
To export audiences to Taboola, an active cookie sync using the Lytics JavaScript Tag is required. Additionally, only audiences that have been manually configured in Taboola can be exported to using this workflow. See theRequired Setupsection below.
This export requires additional account setup before you can begin exporting audiences. Follow these steps to prepare your account for exporting audiences to Taboola:
The LyticsJavaScript Tagsupports aJavaScript Tag Integrationwhich syncs Taboola cookie IDs to your Lytics profiles. See theCookie Syncdocument for more information.
Once the cookie sync is set up, the S3 CSV Export workflow is used to export Lytics audiences to Taboola. The export uploads CSVs containing audience membership to an S3 shared between Lytics and Taboola. Taboola ingests the files from the S3 and updates audience membership in Taboola accordingly.

TikTok Custom Audience requirements
It might take a few hours for the audience matching to be completed in TikTok. After the initial file upload in a TikTok custom audience, a new file will not be appended until the custom audience is available to do so.
The resulting TikTok custom audience must have a minimum of 1,000 matched and opted-in users in order to be available for use. If this minimum has not been met the custom audience will be marked asUnavailablewithin TikTok.
We recommend sending at least 5,000 phone numbers or 10,000 emails, as phone numbers tend to have a higher match rate in TikTok. This suggestions is based on TikTok's requirement for 1000 matched trackable users within their platform.
The export job gives you an option to send Users ID to TikTok. You can send Apple IDFA (Identifier for Advertisers), GAID (Google Advertising ID), Email or Phone Number as part of job configuration. You may send multiple ID types in a single file. Please refer to TikTok'sfile requirementdocumentation for more information on what can be sent to TikTok in a file.

If you want toexport audiencesfrom Lytics to The Trade Desk you will need a field in Lytics, "The Trade Desk Identifier". One way to add this identifier to a Lytics profile is using this client-side cookie sync to exchange Lytics cookie IDs with matching IDs from The Trade Desk.
This integration is only supported by the current version (version 3) of the Lytics JavaScript tag. If you currently have version 2 installed, please read ourmigrating to version 3article in our archived documentation.
Once the integration isenabled, the following will occur on every page load where the Lytics JavaScript tag is installed on your website:
The following fields are imported to thethetradedeskdata stream:
In addition, as part of this sync, the current_uidfield for that user will be exported to The Trade Desk.
Follow these steps to set up and configure the cookie sync between Lytics and The Trade Desk:
Export your Lytics audiences to The Trade Desk for use in your advertising campaigns.
This integration utilizes The Trade Desk API to send Lytics audiences. Once initiated, the job will proceed as follows.
It will take around 24 hours after the users have been exported for the active IDs count to display in The Trade Desk. The segment in The Trade Desk is targetable as soon as it surfaces in the DMP as long as there are more than 1,000 IDs received in the segment. Learn more inThe Trade Desk docs.
Follow these steps to set up and configure an audience export to The Trade Desk from Lytics. If you are new to creating jobs in Lytics, see theDestinationsdocumentation for more information.
Lytics Experiencessupport The Trade Desk Ad Groups that can be used to assemble targeting specifics and strategies. Using the Lytics Canvas, you can activate Ad Groups in The Trade Desk with Lytics audiences to engage users and drive conversions.
Like all Experience enabled providers, you canimport Experiencesfrom The Trade Desk to Lytics. During the import process, you will be asked to select an authorization. ReadThe Trade Desk authorization documentationfor more information.
Before you can import, you will need to select the Advertiser that owns the Ad Groups you wish to import. The Advertisers accessible to the authorization you selected will be displayed in the drop down menu below.
Once you've selected an Advertiser, you can import eligible Ad Groups as Lytics Experiences.
On import, tactics are included in the label for the experience in Lytics. Lytics determines an Ad Group's tactic via theAdGroup.RTBAttributes.ROIGoalfield from The Trade Desk API.
The Trade Desk Experiences in Lytics support the following tactics:
After importing a The Trade Desk Experience you can configure it for activation. All tactics for The Trade Desk Experiences have the same three configuration steps within theExperience Editor:
Target- select the target audience for your Experience.
Configure The Trade Desk- set up how the audience for your Experience will be exported. This step will match the configuration instructions of theThe Trade Desk Export Audiencesand will generally function the same, but without theAudienceselection, as that is configured by the Target step in the Experience editor.
Configure Delivery- choose to turn the Delivery Optimization feature on or off. To learn more about this feature, see ourDelivery Optimization Documentation.
Once you've finished configuring the Experience you can save and activate it.
Activating The Trade Desk Experiences in Lytics initiates anAudience Exportof the target audience, it will appear in The Trade Desk under the name of the Experience. Once exported, the Experience audience can be added to your Ad Group in The Trade Desk.
Experience Metrics are collected for The Trade Desk Experiences by launching an Experience Metrics collection workflow. Metrics are collected for The Trade Desk Ad Groups via theMy Reports API. When the workflow starts, it will schedule a performance report for the Ad Groups that have been imported into Lytics. The report schedule will be named using the following convention: "Lytics {WORK ID}." When started for the first time, the workflow will schedule a report to pull in the last 24 hours of performance data, and thereafter to pull in data daily. Every hour, the workflow will check for a new report execution to ingest. If one is available, the workflow will download and parse the report for Ad Group Impressions and Clicks. From these, the Click Rate will be calulated.
Metrics from The Trade Desk appear in the experience UI as follows:
Reached- How many users have seen the creatives in your Ad Group since import to Lytics was initiated.
Clicks- How many users clicked on creatives in your Ad Group when reached.
Click Rate- This is calculated as the ratioClicks/Impressions

Paragraphs:
Webhooks are commonly used in conjunction with custom development. They are an easy way to have your product or application receive a signal from Lytics when we notice a change in a user's state (enter/leave audience). This can be very valuable for triggering changes in multiple systems without asking our platform for an update.  Instead, we 'tell' your system when something has changed so that you can take action. If an audience definition needs to be changed and it has an active webhook, we recommend stopping the webhook workflow and recreating it after making the changes.
If you use webhooks to export an audience that relies on a time-based trigger, for example, users who have been modified within a window of time, the window must be at least 30 minutes. Smaller windows may be unreliable due to the pipeline necessary for checking audience membership at a specific time.
Combining Lytics and webhooks with lightweight web apps offers powerful ways to deliver custom experiences across any channel. Check out theMobile Messaging with Lytics Webhooksuse case for a real-world example. See ourSubscription API documentationfor more information about utilizing webhooks with Lytics.
Complete the following steps to authorize your target webhooks resource. If no authorization is required, you may select theWebhook endpoint does not require authorizationoption below.
If you are new to creating authorizations in Lytics, see theAuthorizationsdocumentation for more information.
To provide authorization as a request header or parameter you will need to enter the following:

Before attempting to create an Oauth 2.0 Client Gredentials Grant authorization, make sure the service you are connecting with supports authenticating via theclient_credentialsgrant type. For authorizing with an OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant you will need the following credentials. Once these are submitted, they will be used to retrieve an access token from theToken URLand stored securely in order to retrieve a new token when the existing one expires. When a job is configured using this authorization, the access token will be included in calls from the export as a header in the formAuthorization: Bearer YourAccessToken.

Use this job  to send Lytics audience enter/exit event triggers to your webhooks URL. If you use webhooks to export an audience that relies on a time-based trigger, for example, users who have been modified within a window of time, it is important that the window be at least 30 minutes. Smaller windows may not be reliable due to the pipeline necessary for checking audience membership at a specific time.
By default, the job will send all the user fields as a JSON payload of the POST request to the configured webhooks URL. There are two kinds of JSON payloads for POST requests: the Lytics default version, and a CloudEvents version.
Lytics default:
Lytics defaultaudience enterevent with user fields selected:

Paragraphs:
Lytics Webhook Templates enable the configuration of customized workflows for any destination. The setup process may vary based on the downstream provider. Below is a step-by-step guide for configuring a robust workflow with Insider.
If you haven't already done so, you will need to setup an Insider account before you begin the process described below.
To authorize an Insider workflow, you must provide an Insider API key so Lytics can communicate with Insider's APIs to send and receive data from your account. For instructions on how to create an API key, refer to Insider'sAPI key documentation.
Select Insider from the list of providers.
Select theAPI Keymethod for authorization.
Enter a Label to identify your authorization.
(Optional) Enter a Description for further context on your authorization.
Enter the Insider API Key that you generated.
Click Save Authorization.

To successfully send requests to the Insider APIs via Lytics webhook workflow, we must create an authorization using the key and secret outlined below.
This integration leverages our Webhook integration to connect with and retrieve data from Ansira's endpoints. Begin by selecting theWebhooksprovider tile.
Next, select an authorization method. If this is your first time creating an authorization for Insider, selectProvide authorization as request header or parameter.
Next, we'll configure the authorization to use a request header and request parameter provided by Insider. Please configure all fields as outlined below and leave any additional fields blank unless you fully understand the implications.
Create a label for your authorization. This will only surface in the Lytics UI for easy navigation when selecting the authorization in additional workflows or reviewing the details and logs.
Add an optional description to provide context for where the auth came from and how it will be used.
Insider will provide both theX-PARTNER-NAMEand theX-REQUEST-TOKEN.
Leave this field blank.
This integration utilizes theLytics' Audience Trigger Webhookto send a secure request to Insider when a user enters the source audience. This request is sent to thePOST api/user/v1/upsertendpoint and contains user data configured within the template described below to send a Lytics profile with extended information about that user to Insider. The Insiderupsert API docswill inform on the type of information that can be sent. We'll outline the following steps to enable this enrichment workflow:
Select or configure a new authorization as outlinedabove.
Webhook templates are created usingjsonnet. These templates provide a flexible way to reformat the outbound payload of a webhook request to meet the recipient's requirements. In this case, we'll create a template that provides the proper formatting of identifiers, attributes, and event data for the InsideruserAPI. This step may appear to be technical. As such, if you need assistance, please contact your technical account manager or primary point of contact.
The example below shows how to structure the template in order to send segment entrances, segment metadata, and profile attributes to Insider. The  Insider upsertAPI docshas more information on how the data should be structured if there are additional questions.
Jsonnet is highly customizable. In the example above, we pull theemailfrom the profile and hard code alanguageIf the desire is for thelanguageto be dynamic, this could also leverage the.event.getmethod to pull the value from each profile. If you use the dynamic method, the field name in the event.get() function is the field name that has been defined in the Lytics schema, as seen in the example below:
This integration utilizes theLytics' Audience Trigger Webhookto send a secure request to Insider when a user exits the source audience. This request is sent to thePOST auser/v1/attribute/deleteendpoint and contains user data configured within the template described below to send a Lytics profile with extended information about that user to Insider. The Insiderdelete API docswill inform on the type of information that can be sent. We'll outline the following steps to enable this enrichment workflow:

If you use the dynamic method, the field name in the event.get() function is the field name that has been defined in the Lytics schema, as seen in the example below:
In the final step, we will combine it by configuring our webhook destination to use the auth, templates, and audience to enrich a Lytics profile. It is important to ensure the auth is selected for the corresponding webhook trigger for entrances and exits. Because they have different structures, the data will not be updated properly in insider if this step is not followed.
This integration leverages our Webhook integration to connect with and retrieve data from Ansira's endpoints. Begin by selecting theWebhooksprovider tile.
Next, select theAudience Triggers Webhookjob type. This webhook job will pass the response of each request to the configured data stream to be mapped back to a user's profile.
There is a list of fields available to configure for the Lytics webhook. The details for those configurable fields can be found in the webhook documentation. Below are the required fields specific to the Lytics and Insider workflow.
Select one or more audiences to enrich with Ansira data. We highly recommend following the suggested approach in theaudienceof this doc to prevent invalid or unnecessary calls to the Ansira API.
Select the template that was created in the previous step.
This should be Exit or Entrance, depending on the JSONNET template it is linked to.
Do not select any fields. This will default to syncing the entire profile based on the defined template.

Paragraphs:
Lytics Insights provide visibility into how your audiences and campaigns perform and recommend how you may improve engagement, drive conversions, and increase marketing ROI.
You can think of Lytics Insights as a way to connect thedatayou have with thedecisionsyou are making for marketing campaigns. Defined in a few words, Lytics Insights are:
Insights serve as a key ingredient to achieve marketing personalization. To effectively leverage customer data, you must apply it throughout your campaign planning and execution process. Unlike metrics that remain on a BI dashboard or report, Lytics Insights are designed beimmediately activatedin your segmentation and campaign strategies.
If your account package includes Insights, you can access Insights from anywhere in the Lytics UI.
Insights surface meaningful data and recommended action, enabling you to make better, data-driven decisions during your campaign planning and execution. The core idea behind Insights is simple. Insights are a combination of facts and actions:
Insights are made possible thanks to the data science capabilities built into Lytics. The heavy lift of processing and interpreting data is automatically handled by machine learning models under-the-hood.
This is a prime example of how machine learning can augment (not replace) a marketer’s role. Machines efficiently and accurately sift through lots of data, allowing people to then make use of the important information in the most relevant context. For example, a model can predict which users are most likely to churn, and a marketer can then target those at-risk users with a win-back campaign on Facebook.
Insights are presented asInsight Cardsthat are available throughout the entire app.Simply navigate to the left-hand side of the Lytics UI to open theInsights Drawer, which contains a list ofInsight Cardsunique to your account.
Below is an example of an Insight card and what it's comprised of:

Insights are generated and refreshed on aweekly basisto ensure you are viewing the most recent user data. Insights expire after 2 weeks, so you only target and activate an audience and campaigns during a relevant time frame.
The Insights Drawer will display a maximum of 25 cards at a time. Insights will be created for up to10 custom audiences, in addition to Lytic's out-of-the-box engagement audiences. Lytics will prioritize Insights based on the statistical significance of the data and the most frequently used audiences.
Compositional Insights help you understand the makeup of your audiences. This information can answer, “what makes an audience unique?” and “How should I target these users differently?”
Compositional Insights make it easier for you to create effective segmentation strategies. They compare data fields within audiences to surface which attributes drive user behavior. Compositional Insights currently include the following:
This Insight compares high-value audiences on their levels of engagement. This can take the form of comparing Lytic's out-of-the-box audiences on a particular behavioral score or a custom audience.

As a bite-size piece of information, this Insight Card has provided:
This Insight compares the prevalence of specific data fields within two audiences. Candidates included arefields used in audience definitionsand fields from thePromoted Schema Fieldsin yourAccount Settings.

Having a granular understanding of your audiences allows you to make more strategic targeting decisions. For example, there may be a data field that your organization is paying to collect. If you discover through an Insight Card that this field is not performing as expected in your campaigns, you could save marketing spend by eliminating that field and using others that are shown to be more predictive of user behavior.
Experience Insights help you track and understand campaign performance. This information can answer, “Which campaigns are resonating with my users?” and “Are my marketing tactics driving engagement or conversions?”
Experience Insights allow you to refine campaigns based on current metrics proactively. Since Lytics Insights are generated and refreshed every week, you can take action to improve a campaign while it’s running.
Experience Insights include the following types:
This Insight will surface when an experience is missing UTM parameters, which enable Lytics to track conversions from downstream tools such as Facebook.

While this Insight is more straightforward than the other types Lytics offers, it helps you quickly identify when an Experience configuration is incomplete, affecting your ability to track performance and target users who have previously engaged in future campaigns.
This Insight appears when a significant spike up or down in campaign performance exists. Awareness of such incidents allows you to make the necessary changes to improve campaign ROI.
For example, if conversion rates have rapidly declined for a particular campaign in the last week, you may need to reevaluate and consider changes such as refining your audience, messaging, or campaign tactics.
Taking action based on your Insights is the most important part of the process. As the introduction explains, Lytics Insights are designed to be actionable. By understanding how users interact with your brand at a granular level, you can iterate campaigns to improve their performance and deliver better user experiences.
User engagement is a crucial component of personalization. Each Lytics Score (quantity, frequency, recency, intensity, momentum, propensity) indicates a different aspect of user behavior,  but overall, higher scores indicate high engagement, while lower scores indicate low engagement.
Below are some everyday use cases you might consider, depending on whether the target audience hashigherbehavioral scores (anything above 50) orlowerbehavioral scores (anything below 50).
There are two main approaches to reaching unengaged users. The first is to drive engagement using a variety of tactics, such as messaging on different channels, targeting based on content affinities, etc. The second approach is to increase marketing efficiency by suppressing these users, thus improving your conversions.
When creating strategies around your most active users, you will want to keep them engaged by delivering relevant content and establishing a first-party relationship that increases their Lifetime Value (LTV). You can find more users who are similar to your best customers using lookalike audiences.
You can also learn more about what makes these engaged users different, which can inform your overall targeting strategies.
Giving your users more of what they love is a great tactic to consider to either drive engagement for less active users or to keep currently active users engaged.

Crawling: https://docs.lytics.com/docs/importing-external-experiences
Paragraphs:
You can import existing marketing initiatives currently managed by your channel providers, which enables you to quickly gain insights about the campaigns you’re already running. You can then take action by connecting these Experiences to your Lytics audiences.
While you can monitor Experiences and activate audiences for them within Lytics, the management of external Experiences still happens inside your channel tools. If you want to stop, delete, or edit the execution of an Experience, you need to do so within the provider. If you choose to delete an Experience in Lytics that still has a matching campaign in your channel tool, it will show up on the import list and can be re-imported.
Lytics serves as a central hub to monitor your cross-channel marketing, making it easier to understand and improve the performance of  your campaigns. For example, instead of logging into Facebook to check your ad campaign metrics and Iterable to check your email newsletter open rates, you can monitor the performance of both tools within your Lytics dashboard.
To start monitoring external Experiences on Lytics, follow the batch import steps.
On your Lytics dashboard, navigate toExperiences, and selectAdd Experiences > Import.
The Lytics Canvas connects out-of-the-box with select channel providers. Over time, more providers will be added to this list. If you want to use a provider that is not currently available, you can use the "Generic Experience" workflow to export Lytics audiences to any of your integrated providers.

Next, you will be prompted to select an authorization for your chosen provider. Existing authorizations will be shown. If you have multiple accounts within a particular channel such as Facebook, you will choose which account to import from. If you don’t have an authorization, you will be prompted to add one before continuing. For Facebook, there is a second step for authorizing Ad Set ID after you’ve selected your account ID.
Finally, select the Experiences you want to import into Lytics (up to 10 at a time). The total number of Experiences you can bring into Lytics is only limited by the amount in your connected provider. However, to have meaningful and accurate reporting, it's recommended to only import Experiences that will add value to your use cases.

Completed experiences, such as an Ad Set that previously "ended", will not show on the list of importable Experiences. But if you have Ad Sets in Facebook that are saved as drafts, paused, or currently running, those will be available to import.
Once you start monitoring external Experiences, you can activate them by adding a Lytics audience. This lets you enrich your existing campaigns with Lytics behavioral audiences, content affinities, and delivery optimization.An example use case is to conserve Facebook ad spend by only targeting “Currently Engaged” users who have a high affinity for the content of a particular campaign. Leveraging data science under the hood, Lytics audiences can bring immediate value to your existing marketing campaigns.
If you have already imported an external Experience, you can activate it from the Experience summary view by clickingEditin the top right.

If you want to activate an Experience that you haven't imported yet, follow the single import steps below, which will guide you through the Experience editor.
To activate an Experience that you haven't imported yet, you will follow the workflow of creating a new Experience in Lytics. From the Experiences list view, clickAdd Experiences>New.
Select your chosen provider and thenImportthe campaign, ad set, or journey. This example will continue with importing a SendGrid campaign.

Next you will select an Authorization for your chosen provider as described above.

Then you will select the campaign or ad set to import. Note that here you can only import one Experience at a time. ClickImport 1 Experienceto continue.
Finally, you will complete the following Experience Editor steps:
Upon completion, your Experience will be ready to publish.

Crawling: https://docs.lytics.com/docs/idp-initiated-sso-legacy
Paragraphs:
This document describes a legacy implementation that Lytics is actively deprecating. If you're looking for details on the current SSO implementation, check out thenew documentation.
Lytics supports enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) by usingAuth0as a service provider usingSAML protocol. Lytics integrates with Identity Providers (IdPs) in such a way that the IdP initiates SSO. That is, when your end user logs in to their IdP, they will use a global portal for your organization. Users can then click a link or button that will log them into Lytics seamlessly.
Behind the scenes, the IdP will be contacting the Lytics Auth0 service provider to verify the user and redirect them to a logged-in instance of the Lytics app. This document describes the process for integrating with a new IdP that uses SAML.
To configure SAML for the Lytics service provider some information is required about your IdP. If you have a metadata file that contains SAML provider information this may be appropriate, just make sure that the following information is provided toLytics Support:
Further configuration details such as mappings may need to be provided. Once this information has been received, Lytics can configure the SAML connection in Auth0.
After Lytics configures the SAML connection on the service provider,Lytics Supportwill provide a metadata XML file with the following information in order to complete the IdP configuration. The key fields in this metadata are:
With this information, your IdP connection can be configured to complete the SSO integration.
Once all the information has been configured in both the IdP and the Lytics service provider, you can test and verify that the SSO implementation works as expected. If you are using SSO as your only sign-in method, please disable any password restriction or expiration settings that may have been enabled in the UI.
During the testing process, Lytics can be configured to allow both SSO logins and regular username and password (or Google OAuth) login through the app. This allows users to test SSO without disrupting the day-to-day usage of the app.
If requested, once the SSO implementation has been tested and verified, Lytics can disable the use of other logins for an account.
If it's known that SSO is going to be added to an account, then the user email addresses added to the account should match the email address present within the IdP. If the email address doesn’t match, then the login will fail as Lytics will not be able to verify that there is a user with that email address.
For instance, if the email listed in the IdP isabc@123, and within Lytics it’sdef@456, then the user will have successfully been verified by their IdP, but the login within Lytics would fail as the authenticated user email would not match the user within Lytics. You would need to create a new user within Lytics with the email addressabc@123for the SSO login to be successful.
It should also be noted that primary accounts are decided as the first account that a user was added to.  Due to this,  users from a single group/organization will often have different primary accounts. This is important for SSO as it will also be the account that the user is logged into at the start of their session. If SSO is enabled as the only means of login on one account and a user attempts to log-in using Google OAuth or their username and password, the login session will fail. The following options are possible solutions:
Lytics Supportcan assist in the troubleshooting process. When testing for the first time Lytics can enable logging to help troubleshoot any issues you may encounter. If you are receiving the error message shown below after being redirected to the app, that means there is an issue on the application side.

TheLytics Supportteam can help debug this if you provide information on the login attempt such as the time of the login and the user and account.
If you’re encountering an error earlier in the login process, such as before you are redirected to the Lytics app, this may be an issue with the SAML configuration either on the IdP or Service provider side. Lytics’ support team can review these issues and coordinate a fix, just contact us with the details of the issue.

Published campaigns can be thought of as your "active" campaigns. In order for a campaign widget to show up on your website, the campaign must be published. To edit a published campaign, it needs to be paused. This will temporarily hide it from your website while you make changes.
If you want to save a partially completed campaign, or save a finished campaign that you’re not ready to put on your website, you can save it as a draft. A campaign draft can be published or edited at any time.
Published campaigns automatically become archived when they reach their end date. In order to keep their reporting historically accurate, archived campaigns cannot be edited.

How long does it take
                to

Paragraphs:
To ensure that content classification, affinities, and real-time user profiles function as expected, we'll walk you through a few easy steps to ensure your account is configured correctly. You'll need to navigate to your account settings for all of the steps within this section.
Use the left-hand navigation to selectAccount>Settings>Details.
Ensure theAccount Nameused is accurate and descriptive.
Verify that theDomainreflects your primary web address.Note: Your domain should include the relevant subdomain (www, etc.) and exclude the protocol (httporhttps).
EnsureAllow access via APIis checked.
PressSave Changesto confirm the updates.
TheAllow access via APIsetting ensues that the current visitor's profile is surfaced and accessible via JavaScript on your website. If unchecked, the Personalization API will prevent access and no profile will be made available.
Use the left-hand navigation to selectAccount>Settings>Content.
Scroll down toContent domains allowlist.
Update theContent domains allowlistto include all domains and subdomains where the tag will be installed.Note: Be sure to update the domains allowlist, not the paths allowlist.
Automated classification requires a valid robots.txt file on your configured domain(s). In addition, we highly recommend using your production URL rather than a development URL for classification. This will greatly reduce confusion when it comes to recommendations and moving to production.
For the content classification and affinity service to run properly, you must ensure all target domains have been listed. This prevents content from an unintended domain from ever being classified and associated with your profiles.
