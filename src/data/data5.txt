Paragraphs:
With Segment, you can collect, transform, send, and archive yourfirst-party customer data. Segment simplifies the process of collecting data and connecting new tools, allowing you to spend more time using your data, and less time trying to collect it. You can use Segment to track events that happen when a user interacts with the interfaces. “Interfaces” is Segment’s generic word for any digital properties you own: your website, mobile apps, and processes that run on a server or OTT device.
When you capture interaction data in Segment, you can send it (often in real-time) to your marketing, product, and analytics tools, as well as to data warehouses. In most cases, you won’t even need to touch your tracking code to connect to new tools.
Let's walk through the steps to get up and running on Segment. Let's go!

Paragraphs:
On this page
In a nutshell, the Segment libraries (Sources) generate messages about what’s happening in your site or app, and send them to the Segment servers. Segment then translates the content of those messages into different formats for use by other tools (which Segment callsDestinations), and sends the translated messages to those tools. The Segment servers also archive a copy of the data, and cansend data to your storage systems(such as databases, warehouses, or bulk-storage buckets).

Segment Spec methodsare how you collect interaction data from your interfaces, and theSourcesare what you package with your interfaces to collect and route the data.
Once you’ve collected your interaction data, there are several different actions you can take:
You can collect data by implementing Segment’s tracking libraries as your Sources:
Segment also offers these other source libraries to cover less straightforward cases:
Segment also offersCloud App Sourcesto integrate data from your third-party tools:
Segment supports several ways to implement tracking. The two most common are to usedevice-basedorserver-basedlibraries. You can use Segment’s device-based libraries, such as JavaScript, iOS, and Android, to make calls on users’ browsers or mobile devices. You can also track data with Segment’s server-based libraries, such as Node, Python, or PHP, where the calls are triggered on your own servers and then sent to the Segment servers.
When you collect data using device-based libraries, you can choose between these two different connection modes:
Although there are some tradeoffs between the two approaches, neither is better than the other, and Segment recommends that you implement a mix of both. In general, more direct interaction data is available using a device-based library, but server-based collection is more secure, reliable, and can’t be blocked by ad blockers.
The Segment libraries generate messages about what happens on your interface, translate those messages into different formats for use by destinations, and transmit the messages to those tools.
There are severaltracking API methods, that you can call to generate messages. The four most important methods are:
Every call shares the samecommon fields. When you use these methodsas intended, it allows Segment to detect a specific type of data and correctly translate it to send it on to downstream destinations.
Segment maintains a catalog of destinations where you can send your data.

Welcome to Segment! This doc mirrors Segment’s in-product guide, and walks you through each of the tasks to level up your workspace strength and become familiar with Segment.
The guide is broken into three categories of tasks:
The tasks included in Basics help you send and debug your very first data from aSource(a library that sends data to Segment), and into aDestination(tools you use to analyze or act on your data).
The Basic tasks include:
Segment allows you to invite team members to your workspace. To decide who on your team should be added to Segment, think about who might be responsible for implementing, owning, or using your data in downstream tools.
For example, as a developer, you might invite:
To invite team members to your workspace:
A Source is a website, server library, mobile SDK, or cloud application which can send data into Segment. It’s where your data originates. Add a Source to collect data to understand who your customers are and how they’re using your product. Create a source for each website or app you want to track.
To add a Source:
Learn More
Once you’ve added your Segment Source, you’re ready to send data into Segment. The simplest data to send into Segment is a Page call (for website Sources) or Screen call (for mobile Sources). Page and screen calls send automatically once you install the Segment snippet or SDK on your website or mobile app. Page and screen calls allow you to record whenever a user sees a page of your website or screen of your app, along with any optional properties about the page or screen.
Learn how toinstall the Segment snippet or SDK on your website or mobile appto start sending data.
Learn More
Destinations are the business tools or apps that Segment forwards your data to. Adding Destinations allow you to act on your data and learn more about your customers in real time.
To add a Destination:
Learn More
The Source Debugger is a real-time tool that helps you validate that API calls made from your website, mobile app, or servers arrive at your source. You can use the Source Debugger to make sure that your source functions properly and your events actively send.
The Debugger shows a live stream of events that flow through your Segment Source, so that you can check that your events send in the correct format. When you click on a specific event, you’ll be able to see these two views of an event:
To access your Source Debugger:
Learn More
The tasks in this phase help you create a data strategy and send additional types of data (identify and track calls) to get a clearer picture of who your users are and what actions they’re taking.
The Instrumentation tasks include:
The Identify call allows you to tie a user to their actions and record traits about them. It includes a unique User ID and any optional traits you know about the user, like their email, name, and address. Sending an Identify call is your first step towards understanding who your users are.
An example of the types of details you might want to learn and track about your users in an Identify call are:
Learn More
The Segment Track call allows you to record any actions your users perform, along with any properties that describe the action. Sending a track call is your first step towards understanding what your users are doing.
Each action that a user takes is known as an event. Each event has a name and properties. For example, the User Registered event might have properties likeplanoraccountType.
To save time on instrumentation, be sure to check ifone of Segment’s Business Specsmeets your needs.
Learn More
Segment recommends you to create and maintain a Tracking Plan to have data clarity and team alignment about what customer data you need to collect and why. It’s best to think about the measurable business outcomes you’re trying to track or improve, and then drill down to track the events needed for each business outcome.
For example, if you’re looking to reduce cart abandonment, you may want to engage cart abandoners by sending emails and in-app messaging to them using Customer.io and Intercom. You also might want to track events like Product Added or Cart Viewed along this customer journey.
Segment maintains a number of industry or product-specific specs to help you get started:
Learn More
When it comes to data collection, the best way to set your company up for success is to establish consistent naming conventions. This makes your code easier to read, and it helps everyone at your company understand what your events mean.
Segment recommends the best practice of using an “Object Action” (Noun Verb) naming convention for all Track events (for example, Menu Clicked) and using noun_noun snake case for property names (for example, property_name). You can view all the event names you’re currently tracking in the Schema view to ensure you’re using consistent conventions and casing.
To view your event names in the Source Schema:
Learn More
A data warehouse is a central location where you can store your raw customer data from multiple sources. A data warehouse gives you flexibility to query your data, which allows you to answer analytical questions that may not be possible with a standard analytics tool.
A data warehouse also allows you to collect and compile data from third party tools asCloud Sourcesin Segment, to help you gain a 360 view of your customer touchpoints.
Learn More
Adding more destinations allows you to connect all your business tools to run through Segment. This gives you the confidence that they are all acting on the same data. Most users connect a variety of marketing, advertising, product, and analytics tools.
With all your tools acting on the same set of customer data, you can personalize your customer engagement and deliver a consistent message across multiple channels
To add more destinations:
Learn More
The tasks in this phase help you to optimize your Segment implementation and take it to the next level.
The optimization tasks include:
Adding any additional data sources that you might have, like a mobile app, marketing website, server, or cloud tool will give you a more complete view of your customer.
Each touchpoint you have with your customers is a potential area to gain a better understanding of them.
To add more sources:
Learn More
Cloud sources allow you to pull in customer data from third-party tools (like Twilio or Stripe) into a data warehouse for complex querying. Consolidating your customer data enables you to eliminate data silos to get a single view of your customer.
Before adding a cloud source, you need to make sure you:
Once you have the necessary credentials, to add a cloud source:
Learn More
Protocols automate and scale thedata quality best practicesdeveloped over years of helping users implement Segment. Investing in data quality improves trust in your data, reduces time spent by your engineering and business teams navigating and validating data, and allows your business to grow faster.
There are steps to take when you use Protocols:
Learn More
Engage is a powerful personalization platform that enables you to create unified customer profiles in Segment, to build and enrich audiences, and to activate audiences across marketing tools.
Engage allows you to enrich user profiles with custom traits, allowing you to create granular audiences for campaigns, advertising, and analysis.

Paragraphs:
On this page
When you implement Segment, you add Segment code to your website, app, or server. This code generates messages based on specific triggers you define.
In a basic implementation, the code can be a snippet of JavaScript that you copy and paste into the HTML of a website to track page views. It can also be as complex as Segment calls embedded in a React mobile app to send messages when the app is opened or closed, when the user performs different actions, or when time based conditions are met (for example “ticket reservation expired” or “cart abandoned after 2 hours”).
The best way to learn about how Segment works is to see it in action. This tutorial walks you through an installation using one of Segment’s libraries: JavaScript, PHP, or the iOS library.
Before you start your Segment implementation, you need:
Tip! If you don’t have any of those things, consider creating a simpleGitHub Pages website.
When you develop and test sources, Segment recommends you to create and use separate sources for each of your environments (production, development, staging) to prevent testing and development activities from filling production systems with invalid data.
You can give each source an environment label when you create it, and Segment strongly suggests that you use these labels to sort your sources. When you create a source during the steps below, make sure you enter an environment label.
Double-check when you enter write keys for dev and production environments to make sure that you send the right data to the right place.
To create a Segment source:
The write key is a unique identifier for a source that tells Segment which source the data comes from, to which workspace the data belongs, and which destinations should receive the data.
To find your write key:
Make note of or write down your write key, as you’ll need it in the next steps.
Any time you change a library’s settings in the Segment App, the write key regenerates.

Cloud-sourcesdo not have write keys, as they use a token or key from your account with that service. Cloud-sources have other considerations and aren’t part of this tutorial.
Click a tab below to see the tutorial content for the specific library you chose.
NavigateConnections > Sources > JavaScriptin the Segment app and copy the snippet from the JavaScript Source overview page and paste it into the<head>tag of your site.That snippet loads Analytics.js onto the pageasynchronously, so it won’t affect your page load speed. Once the snippet runs on your site, you can turn on destinations from the destinations page in your workspace and data starts loading on your site automatically.
Note:If you only want the most basic Google Analytics setup you can stop reading right now. You’re done! Just toggle on Google Analytics from the Segment App.
The Segment snippet version history available onGitHub. Segment recommends that you use the latest snippet version whenever possible.

Theidentifymethod is how you tell Segment who the current user is. It includes a unique User ID and any optional traits you know about them. You can read more about it in theidentify method reference.
Note:You don’t need to callidentifyfor anonymous visitors to your site. Segment automatically assigns them ananonymousId, so just callingpageandtrackworks just fine withoutidentify.
Here’s an example of what a basic call toidentifymight look like:
This identifies Michael by his unique User ID (in this case,f4ca124298, which is what you know him by in your database) and labels him withnameandemailtraits. When you put that code on your site, you need to replace those hard-coded trait values with the variables that represent the details of the currently logged-in user.To do that, Segment recommends that you use a backend template to inject anidentifycall into the footer ofevery pageof your site where the user is logged in. That way, no matter what page the user first lands on, they will always be identified. You don’t need to callidentifyif your unique identifier (userId) is not known.Depending on your templating language, your actual identify call might look something like this:
With that call in your page footer, you successfully identify every user that visits your site.
Note:If you only want to use a basic CRM set up, you can stop here. Just enable Salesforce, Intercom, or any other CRM system from your Segment workspace, and Segment starts sending all of your user data to it.

Thetrackmethod is how you tell Segment about the actions your users are performing on your site. Every action triggers what Segment calls an “event”, which can also have associated properties. You can read more abouttrackin thetrack method reference.Here’s an example of what a call totrackmight look like when a user signs up:
This example shows that your user triggered theSigned Upevent and chose your hypothetical'Enterprise'plan.Properties can be anything you want to record, for example:
If you’re just getting started, some of the events you should track are events that indicate the success of your site, likeSigned Up,Item PurchasedorArticle Bookmarked. Segment recommends that you track a few important events as you can always add more later.Once you add a fewtrackcalls, you’re done with setting up Segment. You successfully installed Analytics.js tracking. Now you’re ready to turn on any destination you like from the Segment App.
To install Analytics-iOS, Segment recommends you to useCocoaPods, because it allows you to create a build with specific bundled destinations, and because it makes it simple to install and upgrade.1) Add theAnalyticsdependency to yourPodfileby adding the following line:
2) In your application delegate’s- application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:method, set up the SDK like so:

You don’tneedto use initialization config parameters to track lifecycle events (Application Opened,Application Installed,Application Updated) and screen views automatically, but Segment highly recommends that you do, so you can start off already tracking some important core events.
3) Import the SDK in the files that you use it by adding the following line:

To keep the Segment SDK lightweight, theAnalyticspod only installs the Segment library. This means all of the data goes first to Segment’s servers, and is then forwarded to any destination tools which accept the datafrom Segment.Some destinations don’t accept data from the Segment servers, and instead require that you collect the data from the device. In these cases you must bundle some additional destination code with the Segment SDK. This document skips over this part, but you can see the instructions onhow to bundle the destination tools.Now that the SDK is installed and set up, you’re ready to start making calls.
Theidentifymethod is how you tell Segment who the current user is. It takes a unique User ID, and any optional traits you know about them. You can read more about it in theidentify reference.Here’s an example of what a basic call toidentifymight look like:
This call identifies Michael by his unique User ID (f4ca124298, which is the one you know him by in your database) and labels him withnameandemailtraits.
Note:When you put that code in your iOS app, you need to replace those hard-coded trait values with the variables that represent the details of the currently logged-in user.

Thetrackmethod is how you tell Segment about the actions your users are performing in your app. Every action triggers what we call an “event”, which can also have associated properties. You can read more abouttrackin thetrack method reference.
The Segment iOS SDK can automatically track a few important common events, such asApplication Installed,Application Updated, andApplication Opened. You can enable this option during initialization by adding the following lines:
You should also track events that indicate success in your mobile app, likeSigned Up,Item Purchased, orArticle Bookmarked. Segment recommends that you track a few important events as you can always add more later.Here’s what atrackcall might look like when a user signs up:
This tells us that your user triggered theSigned Upevent, and chose your hypothetical'Enterprise'plan.Properties can be anything you want to record, for example:
Once you’ve added a fewtrackcalls, you’re all set. You successfully instrumented your app, and can enable destinations from your Segment workspace.
To install the library:1) Clone the repository from GitHub into your desired application directory. (If you’re a composer user,you can use this.)
2) Add the following to your PHP script to load the Segment analytics library in your code:
3) In your initialization script, make the following call (In the example, Segment first renames this module toAnalyticsfor convenience):
4) ReplaceYOUR_WRITE_KEYwith the actual write key, which you can find in Segment under your project settings. Otherwise, all that data goes straight to/dev/null.You only need to callinitonce when your php file is requested. All of your files then have access to the sameAnalyticsclient.
Note:The default PHP consumer is thelibcurl consumer. If this is not working well for you, or if you have a high-volume project, you might try one of Segment’s other consumers like thefork-curl consumer.

Theidentifymethod is how you tell Segment who the current user is. It includes a unique User ID and any optional traits that you might know about them.Here’s what a basic call toidentifymight look like:
This identifies Michael by his unique User ID (in this case,f4ca124298, which is what you know him by in your database) and labels him withnameandemailtraits.
Note:When you actually put that code on your site, you need to replace those hard-coded trait values with the variables that represent the details of the currently logged-in user. The easiest way in PHP is to keep a$uservariable in memory.
With that call on the page, you’re now identifying every user that visits your site.If you only want to use a basic CRM set up, you can stop here. Just enable Salesforce, Intercom, or any other CRM system from your Segment workspace, and Segment starts sending all of your user data to it.

Thetrackmethod is how you tell Segment about the actions your users are performing on your site. Every action triggers what Segment calls an “event”, which can also have associated properties.Here’s what a call totrackmight look like when a user signs up:
This tells us that the user triggered theSigned Upevent, and chose your hypotheticalEnterpriseplan.Properties can be anything you want to record, for example:
If you’re just getting started, some of the events you should track are events that indicate the success of your site, likeSigned Up,Item PurchasedorArticle Bookmarked.To get started, Segment recommends you to track track a few important events as you can always add more later.

Call the Segmentflush()method. This manually sends all the queued call data to make sure it makes it to the Segment servers. This is normally done automatically by the runtime, but some PHP installations won’t do it for you, so it’s worth calling at the end of your script, just to be safe.
You’ve successfully installed PHP tracking. Now you’re ready to turn on any destination from the Segment App.
Once you’ve set up your Segment library, and instrumented at least one call, you can look at the Debugger tab for the Source to check that it produces data as you expected.
The Source Debugger is a real-time tool that helps you confirm that API calls made from your website, mobile app, or servers arrive at your Segment Source, so you can quickly see how calls are received by your Segment source, so you can troubleshoot quickly without having to wait for data processing.

The Debugger is separate from your workspace’s data pipeline, and is not an exhaustive view of all the events ever sent to your Segment workspace. The Debugger only shows a sample of the events that the Source receives in real time, with a cap of 500 events. The Debugger is a great way to test specific parts of your implementation to validate that events are being fired successfully and arriving to your Source.
Tip: To see a more complete view of all your events, you might consider setting up either awarehouseor anS3 destination.
The Debugger shows a live stream of sampled events arriving at the Source, but you can also toggle from “Live” to “Pause” to stop the stream and prevent it from displaying new events. Events continue to arrive to your Source while you Pause the stream, they just are not displayed.
You can search on any information you know is available in an event payload to search in the Debugger and show only matching payloads. You can also use advanced search options to limit the results to a specific event.

Two views are available when viewing a payload:
Once you’re satisfied that data is arriving from your new source, it’s time to set up your first destination! As long as you havepageorscreendata coming from the source, you can quickly enable Google Analytics to look at the page view statistics.
If you don’t have a Google Analytics account, you can either set up a free account, or look at the Destination Catalog for a different destination to enable.
You’ll need a tracking ID for Google Analytics (either a “website” or “serverside” tracking ID), or another API key if you’re substituting another destination. Make a note of this ID or key as you’ll need it to connect your destination.
To set up your first destination:
Congratulations! Data is now flowing from the source you set up, to the first destination. Do some test browsing on your site or app, then log in to your downstream tool to see the data in place.
You can click around and load pages to see your Segment calls in action, watch them arrive in the Debugger, and see them arrive in the destination tool.
Note:When you’re done with this test source and destination, you can delete them. This prevents you from getting unplanned “demo” data in your production environment later.
The basics of the Segment platform and what you can do with it.
Think through your goals, plan your calls, and set yourself up for success.

Paragraphs:
On this page
Now that you’ve seen Segment in action, step back and think through what a full implementation of Segment for your organization would look like. Figuring out what events to track in Segment can feel overwhelming. You should expect this planning process to have the following steps:
Be prepared to invest time deciding with stakeholders how to track your data, and planning how you’ll analyze it. The time you spend here will save you lots of time in the future, as following Segment’s best practices allows you to easily change your tracking later.
Tracking is about learning and taking action. Think about what you want to know about your product or customers. Think about what assumptions need to be tested and what theories need to be proven true or false. Think about the unknowns. Here are some helpful questions to get started:
While it may seem obvious, we highly recommend documenting your high-level business objectives. More specifically, ask yourself: what are the measurable business outcomes you want to achieve this year? Do you want to acquire new customers? Generate more new sign-ups, drive more incremental revenue among your current customer base?
The best way to answer this question is to interview stakeholders in your organization who will consume the data.
With your business goals documented, the next step is to map user actions to those business goals. For example, if one of your goals is to activate new signups, you want to think about which activities are related to a signup. Ask yourself, what actions do people takebeforesigning up? Do specific actions predict a user signing up?
As an example, you might end up with a list like this:
While this list represents a tiny fraction of the user actions youcouldtrack, it gives a list focused on your top business objectives. This helps break up the huge project of data collection into smaller chunks.
With your business objectives documented and mapped to user actions, it’s time to build standards that you can use when deciding what to track. With your stakeholders, make a list of the actual events (page or screen views, and user actions) that you want to track. Think about all of the ways your users can interact with your site or app
When you’re first starting out, we recommend that you limit your tracking plan to a few core events, but add lots of properties to provide context about them. We generally see more success with the “less is more” philosophy of tracking data, but you might also decide to take a more liberal “track more and analyze later” approach. Like everything, each alternative has pros and cons that are important to consider especially as it relates to your company’s needs.
Segment maintains several “Business Specs”, which are recommendations based on your type of business that give recommendations on what to track, what additional traits or properties to collect, and how to format them. The two most common are the B2B (business-to-business) Spec, Ecommerce Spec, and Mobile and Video specs.
If these specs meet your business needs, you’re in luck. These specs are built into Segment tracking plan templates, so you don’t need to start from a blank slate.
If your organization sells a product or services to other businesses, you might have different analytics and marketing needs than most companies. You need to understand your customer behaviors both at the user-level, and also at the company or team-level.  You can read more abouthow Segment thinks about B2B tracking, andread more about the B2B Spec.
If your organization sells products online, the E-commerce Spec covers the customer’s journey as they browse your store, click on promotions, view products, add those products to a cart, and complete a purchase. It also provides recommendations about off-page interactions, including interactions with email promotions, coupons, and other systems. You can read more aboutwhy companies need an Ecommerce Spec, read more aboutEcommerce tracking plans, and dive directly into ourEcommerce Spec.
The native Mobile Spec is a common blueprint for the mobile user lifecycle. The Spec outlines the most important events for mobile apps to track, and automatically collects many of these events when you use theSegment Android and iOS SDKs. Read more about thebenefits of the native mobile spec, or read throughthe Native Mobile Specdirectly.
Segment’s video spec helps you understand how customers engage with your video and ad content, including playback events, types of media displayed, and performance metrics. You canread more about our Video Spec.
Regardless of approach, here are some important best practices to keep in mind:
Pick a casing convention:We recommendTitle Casefor event names andsnake_casefor property names. Make sure you pick a casing standard and enforce it across your events and properties.
Pick an event name structure:As you may have noticed from ourspecs, we’re big fans of the Object (Blog Post) + Action (Read) framework for event names. Pick a convention and stick to it.
Don’t create event names dynamically:Avoid creating events that pull a dynamic value into the event name (for example,User Signed Up (11-01-2019)). If and when you send these to a warehouse for analysis, you end up with huge numbers of tables and schema bloat.
Don’t create events to track properties:Avoid adding values to event names when they could be a property. Instead, add values as a property. For example, rather than having an event called “Read Blog Post - Best Tracking Plans Ever”, create a “Blog Post Read” event and with a property like"blog_post_title":"Best Tracking Plans Ever".
Don’t create property keys dynamically:Avoid creating property names like"feature_1":"true","feature_2":"false"as these are ambiguous and very difficult to analyze

Got all that? Great. You’re now ready to develop a Tracking Plan.
Atracking planclarifies what events to track, where those events live in the code base, and why you’re tracking those events (from a business perspective).A good tracking plan represents the single source of truth about what data you collect, and why.
Your tracking plan is probably maintained in a spreadsheet (unless you use Segment’s tracking-plan tool,Protocols), and serves as a project management tool to get your organization in agreement about what data to use to make decisions. A tracking plan helps build a shared understanding of the data among marketers, product managers, engineers, analysts, and any other data users.
The Identify call updates all records of the user with a set of traits, and so is extremely important for building your understanding of your users. But how do you choose which traits to include?
The example below shows an Identify call usinganalytics.js) for Segment:
The traits represent dimensions in your data that you can group or pivot on. For example, in the above, you can easily create cohorts of all types that areusersor accounts created within a time window of your choosing.
When you plan your deployment, think about what information you can collect as traits that would be useful to you when grouping users together, and plan how you will collect that information.
The Group call is similar to the Identify call, but it adds traits associated with a parent account to the user’s profile. If your organization is a B2B company, you should also plan the group traits to collect, and how you’ll use them once they’re applied to a user account.
We recommend starting with fewer events that are directly tied to one of yourbusiness objectives, to help avoid becoming overwhelmed by endless number of possible actions to track. As you get more comfortable, you can add more events to your tracking plan that can answer more specialized questions.
At Segment, we started out tracking these events:
Then we added some peripheral events to to better understand how we’re performing, for the following reasons:
For an Ecommerce company, however, the main events might be something like:
Tip: As mentionedabove, Segment has a set of “reserved” event names specifically for ecommerce, called theEcommerce Spec. Check it out to see which events Segment covers and how they are used in downstream destinations.
An online community, on the other hand, has an entirely different set of actions that indicate engagement, as listed below. For example, a community might want to track actions like:
With these actions tracked, the community can develop metrics around engagement, and understand how users move towards their ultimate conversion events. You can read more inthis article from the online community GrowthHackersabout the events they track and why.
Each Track call can accept an optional dictionary of properties, which can contain any key-value pair. These properties act as dimensions that allow destination tools to group, filter, and analyze the events. They give you additional detail on broader events.
Events should be generic and high-level, but properties should be specific and detailed. For example, at Segment,Business Tier Workspace Createdis a horrible event name. Instead, we usedWorkspace Createdwith apropertyofaccount_tierand value ofbusiness:
Similar to the traits in the Identify call, the properties provide a column that you can pivot against or filter on in your analytics tools or allow you to create a cohort of users in email tools.
Don’t create dynamically generated property names in the properties dictionary. Eachkeycreates a new column in your downstream tools, and dynamically generated keys clutter your tools with fragmented data that makes it difficult and confusing to use later.
Here is Segment’sLead CapturedTrack call:
The high-level event isLead Captured, and all of the details appear in the properties dictionary. Because of this, we can easily see in our downstream tools how many leads were captured, and from which parts of the site.
If you want to learn more about how properties are used by downstream tools, check outThe Anatomy of a Track Call.
Once you’ve completed your tracking plan, there’s one more step you might want to do before you move on to actually implementing Segment. TheSegment destination catalogcontains hundreds of tools, many of which you’ll be familiar with already.
If your organization has an established set of analytics tools, look for those tools in the catalog and bookmark their documentation pages. These docs pages contain important information about how Segment transforms data for the destination tool, and they also contain useful details about troubleshooting, set-up, and implementation considerations.
Once you have an initial list of the destination tools your organization uses, you can also checkwhich Segment methods those tools accept. This helps you at implementation time to ensure that the calls you use can be consumed by the tools they’re intended for.
Additionally, you should checkwhich connection modes each tool supports, so you know ahead of time which destinations may need to be bundled.
Tip: If you know you’re looking for a tool for a specific purpose, but haven’t chosen one yet, you can also check theConnection Modes by category pageto see which tools might be compatible with the least implementation changes.
Walk through a disposable, demo implementation.
Take your plans, and make them real.

Before you start implementing from your tracking plan, let’s review the Segment methods, what they do, and when you should use each.
Segment’s libraries generate and send messages to our tracking API in JSON format, and provide a standard structure for the basic API calls. We also provide recommended JSON structure (also known as a schema, or ‘Spec’) that helps keep the most important parts of your data consistent, while allowing great flexibility in what other information you collect and where.
There are six calls in the basic tracking API, which answer specific questions:
Among these calls, you can think of Identify, Group, and Alias as similar types of calls, all to do with updating our understanding of the user who is triggering Segment messages. You can think of these calls as adding information to, or updating an object record in a database.Objectsare described using “traits”, which you can collect as part of your calls.
The other three, Track, Page, and Screen, can be considered as increasingly specific types of events.Eventscan occur multiple times, but generate separate records which append to a list, instead of being updated over time.
A Track call is the most basic type of call, and can represent any type of event. Page and Screen are similar and are triggered by a user viewing a page or screen, however Page calls can come from both web and mobile-web views, while Screen callsonlyoccur on mobile devices. Because of the difference in platform, the context information collected is very different between the two types of calls.
Segment recommends that you always use the Page and Screen calls when recording a page-view, rather than creating a “Page Viewed” Track event, because the Page/Screen calls automatically collect more contextual information.
The most basic Segment message requires only auserIDoranonymousID; all other fields are optional to allow for maximum flexibility. However, a normal Segment message has three main parts: thecommon fields, the“context” object, and the properties (if it’s an event) or traits (if it’s an object).
The common fields include information specific to how the call was generated, like the timestamp and library name and version. The fields in the context object are usually generated by the library, and include information about the environment in which the call was generated: page path, user agent, OS, locale settings, etc. The properties and traits are optional and are where you customize the information you want to collect for your implementation.
Another common part of a Segment message istheintegrationsobject, which you can use to explicitly filter which destinations the call is forwarded to. However this object is optional, and is often omitted in favor of non-code based filtering options.
The Identify call allows Segment to knowwhois triggering an event.
Call Identify when the user first provides identifying information about themselves (usually during log in), or when they update their profile information.
When called as part of the login experience, you should call Identify as soon as possible after the user logs in. When possible, follow the Identify call with a Track event that records what caused the user to be identified.
When you make an Identify call as part of a profile update, you only need to send the changed information to Segment. You can send all profile info on every Identify call if that makes implementation easier, but this is optional.

Best Practices for Identifying Users
These are calledtraitsfor Identify calls, andpropertiesfor all other methods.
The most important trait to pass as part of the Identify call is userId, which uniquely identifies a user across all applications.
You should use a hash value to ensure uniqueness, although other values are acceptable; for example, email address isn’t the best thing to use as a userid, but is usually acceptable since it will be unique, and doesn’t change often.
Beyond that, the Identify call is your opportunity to provide information about the user that can be used for future reporting, so you should try to send any fields that you might want to report on later.
Consider using Identify and traits when:
You can call Identify from any of Segment’s device-based or server-based libraries, includingJavascript,iOS,Android,Ruby, andPython.
Here are two examples of calling Identify from two different libraries:
When a user explicitly signs out of one of your applications, you can callanalytics.reset()to stop logging further event activity to that user, and create a newanonymousIdfor subsequent activity (until the user logins in again and is subsequently identify-ed).This call is most relevant for client-side Segment libraries, as it clears cookies in the user’s browser.
Make areset()call as soon as possible after sign-out occurs, and only after it succeeds (not immediately when the user clicks sign out). For more info on this call,see the JavaScript source documentation.
The Page and Screen calls tell Segment what web page or mobile screen the user is on. This call automatically captures important context traits, so you don’t have to manually implement and send this data.
You can alwaysoverride the auto-collected Page/Screen propertieswith your own, and set additional custom page or screen properties.
Some downstream tools (likeMarketo) require that you attach specific properties (like email address) to every Page call.
This is considered a destination-specific implementation nuance, and you should check the documentation for each destination you plan to use and make a list of these nuances before you start implementation.
You can specify a page “Name” at the start of the page or Screen call, which is especially useful to make list of page names into something more succinct for analytics. For example, on an ecommerce site you might want to callanalytics.page( "Product" )and then provide properties for that product:
Segment automatically calls a Page event whenever a web page loads. This might be enough for most of your needs, but if you change the URL path without reloading the page, for example in single page web apps, you must call Page manually .
If the presentation of user interface components don’t substantially change the user’s context (for example, if a menu is displayed, search results are sorted/filtered, or an information panel is displayed on the exiting UI)measure the event with a Track call, not a Page call.
Note: When you trigger a Page call manually, make sure the call happensafterthe UI element is successfully displayed, not when it is called. It shouldn’t be called as part of the click event that initiates it.
For more info on Page calls, reviewPage specandAnalytics.js docs.
Segment Screen calls are essentially the Page method, except for mobile apps. Mobile Screen calls are treated similarly to standard Page tracking, only they contain more context traits about the device. The goal is to have as much consistency between web and mobile as is feasible.
The Track call allows Segment to knowwhatthe user is doing.
The Track call is used to track user and system events, such as:
Your Track calls should include both events and properties.Events are the actions you want to track, andproperties are the dataaboutthe event that are sent with each event.
Propertiesare powerful. They enable you to capture as much context about the event as you’d like, and then cross-tabulate or filter your downstream tools. For example, let’s say an eLearning website is tracking whenever a user bookmarks an educational article on a page. Here’s what a robust analytics.js Track call could look like:
With this Track call, we can analyze which authors had the most popular articles, which months and years led to the greatest volume of bookmarking overall, which button locations drive the most bookmark clicks, or which users gravitate towards infographics related to Data Planning.
Each event you track must have a name that describes the event, like ‘Article Bookmarked’ above. That name is passed in at the beginning of the Track call, and should be standardized across all your properties so you can compare the same actions on different properties.
Segment’s best practice is to use an “Object Action” (Noun<>Verb) naming convention for allTrackevents, for example, ‘Article Bookmarked’.
Segment maintains a set ofBusiness Specswhich follow this naming convention around different use cases such as eCommerce, B2B SaaS, and Mobile.
Let’s dive deeper into the Object Action syntax that all Segment Track events should use.
Nouns are the entities or objects that the user or the system acts upon.
It’s important to be thoughtful when naming objects so that they are referred to consistently within an application, and so that you refer to the same objects that might exist in multiple applications or sites by the same name.
Use the following list of objects to see if there is a logical match with your application. If you have objects that aren’t in this list, name it in a way that makes sense if it were to appear in other applications, and/or run it by Product Analytics.
Verbs indicate the action taken by either a user on your site. When you name a new Track event, consider if you can describe the current interaction using a verb from the list below.
If you can’t, choose a verb that describes what the user is trying to do in your specific case, but try to be flexible enough so that you could use it in other scenarios.
Segment recommends that you record property names usingsnake case(for exampleproperty_name), and that you format property values to match how they are captured. For example, ausernamevalue would be captured in whatever case it the user typed it in as.
Ultimately, you can decide to use a casing different from our recommendations; however,the single most important aspect is that you’re consistent across your entire tracking with one casing method.
You can read more aboutbest practices for Track calls, .
All of the basicSegment methodshave a common structure and common fields which are automatically collected on every call. You can see these in thecommon fields documentation.
The following properties should be sent with every Track call:
You can make a Track call from any of Segment’s client-side or server-side libraries, includingJavaScript,iOS,Android,Ruby, andPython. Here are two examples of calling Track from two different libraries:

Crawling: https://segment.com/docs/getting-started/05-data-to-destinations/
Paragraphs:
On this page
Once you’ve got data flowingintoSegment, what do you do with it? The Segment Destination catalog lists all of the places we can send your data.
When you enable a destination in the Segment App, you link it to a specific source (or sources). By default, Segment first processes the data from the selected source(s), then translates it and routes it from the Segment servers to the API endpoint for that destination.
This means that if you previously had loaded code or a snippet for that tool on your website or app, you should remove it once you have Segment implemented so you don’t send duplicate data.
You might also want to enable tools that need to be loaded on the user’s device (either a computer or mobile device) in order to function properly. For our Analytics.js library, you can make these changes from the Segment App, and the Segment systems then update the bundle of code served when users request the page to include code required by the destination. You can read more about this in ourdocumentation on Connection Modes.
Adding a destination is quick and easy from the Segment App. You’ll need a token or API key for the tool, or some way to confirm your account in the tool.
If you’re just starting out, we know thecatalogcan be really overwhelming. How do you choose from all of the available destinations?
We’ve written a lot abouthow to choose your tools, but as a start, we recommend that you have one tool from each of the following categories:
If you’re adding more destinations after you’ve done your Segment instrumentation, you might want to check that the destinations you choosecan accept the methodsyou’re already using, and that they canuse the Connection Modesyou’re already using.
We also feel that it’s really important to have a data warehouse, so you can get aclearer view of all of your datafor analytics purposes. More on that just below.
Warehouses are a special type of destination which receive streaming data from your Segment sources, and store it in a tableschema based on your Segment calls. This allows you to do a lot of interesting analytics work to answer your own questions about what your users are doing and why.
All customers can connect a data warehouse to Segment. Free and Team customers can connect one, while Business customers can connect as many as needed.
You should spend a bit of timeconsidering the benefits and tradeoffs of the warehouse options, and then choose one from ourwarehouse catalog.
When you choose a warehouse, you can then use the steps in the documentation to connect it. This may require that you create a new dedicated user (or “service user”) to allow Segment to access the database.
Once your warehouse is configured and running, you can connect to it using a Business Intelligence (BI) tool (such as Looker, Mode, Tableau, or others) to analyze your data in-depth.
There are also a number of Business tier features you can then use with your warehouse, includingselective syncandReplay.

Paragraphs:
On this page
One of the most important questions you’ll ask early on is“How do I know if Segment is working?”
There are several ways to check if your data is flowing. One is theDebugger tab in each Sourcein the Segment web app, where you can see data coming from a source into Segment. Another is theEvent Delivery toolwhich shows which data is arriving at specific destinations.
For monitoring purposes, you’ll also see alerts in theWorkspace Healthtool if your sources or destinations produce repeated errors.
Want more? Check out our course on debugging and troubleshooting. (Must be logged in to access.)
The Source Debugger is a real-time tool that helps you confirm that API calls made from your website, mobile app, or servers arrive to your Segment Source, so you can troubleshoot your Segment set up even quicker. With the Debugger, you can check that you’re sending calls in the expected format, without having to wait for any data processing.

The Debugger is separate from your workspace’s data pipeline and is not an exhaustive view of all the events ever sent to your Segment workspace. The Debugger only shows a sample of the events that the Source receives in real time, with a cap of 500 events. The Debugger is a great way to test specific parts of your implementation to validate that events are being fired successfully and arriving to your Source.
To see a more complete view of all your events, we recommend that you set up either awarehouseor anS3 destination.
The Debugger shows a live stream of sampled events arriving into the Source, but you can also pause the stream from displaying new events by toggling “Live” to “Pause”. Events continue to arrive to your Source while you Pause the stream.
You can search in the Debugger to find a specific payload using any information you know is available in the event’s raw payload. You can also use advanced search options to limit the results to a specific event.

Two views are available when viewing a payload:
The Event Delivery tool helps you see if Segment is encountering issues delivering your data from your sources to their connected destinations.
Segment sends billions of events to destinations every week. If our systems encounter errors when trying to deliver your data, we report them in the Event Delivery tool.
Here is an example of what the Event Delivery tool looks like:

Event Delivery is most useful when:
You can access the Event Delivery tool from the destinationSettingstab in any supported destination.

Event Delivery is only available for cloud-mode destinations, which receive data through the Segment servers. Device-mode destinations receive data through an API endpoint outside the Segment servers, where we cannot monitor or report on it.Event delivery is not available for Warehouses or Amazon S3 destinations.
The UI shows three parts that report on Segment’s ability to deliver your source data: Key Metrics, Error Details, and Delivery Trends.
Before you begin,select a time period from the drop down menu at the right. The Event Delivery display updates to show only information about your selected time period.

This panel displays quantitative information about the destination’s data flow:
Delivered:The number of messages Segment successfully delivered to the destination in the selected time period.
Not Delivered:The number of messages Segment was unable to deliver. If this number is greater than zero, the reasons for these failures appear in the errors table below.
P95 Latency:The time it takes for Segment to deliver the slowest 5% of your data (known as P95 latency). The latency reported is end-to-end: from the event being received through the Segment API, to the event being delivered to partner API. This helps tell you if there is a delay in your data pipeline, and how severe it is.
The Error details table displays a summary of the errors in a given period, and the most important information about them. You can click any row in the table to expand it to show more information.

The Error Details view gives you as much information as possible to help you resolve the issue. The example below shows an example Error Details panel.

This view includes:
You Sent- the data you sent to Segment’s API.
Request to Destination- the request Segment made to the Partner API. This payload will likely be different from what you sent it because Segment is mapping your event to the partner’s spec to ensure the message is successfully delivered.
Response from Destination- the response Segment received from the Partner API. This will have the raw partner error. If you need to troubleshoot an issue with a Partner’s Success team, this is usually something they’ll want to see.
View Segment’s list ofIntegration Error Codesfor more information about what might cause an error.
When debugging, it’s helpful to see when issues start, stop and how they trend over time.
The Event Delivery view shows a graph with the following information:
Delivered: The number of events that were successfully delivered in the time period you selected.
Not delivered: The number of events that were not successfully delivered in the time period you selected.
The Latency view shows the end-to-end P95 latency during the time period you selected.

You can onboard to Segment with a Use Case if you’re a new Business Tier customer or haven’t yet connected a source and destination.
Segment supports 25 use cases, organized into 4 main business goals:
These goals represent key ways businesses often use customer data for improved performance and growth.
Looking for a technical breakdown of each use case? View theUse Cases Reference.
Follow these steps to identify which use case to implement:
The use case you select will guide your Segment setup, including the events you’ll track and the integrations you’ll implement. However, Segment’s flexibility allows you to adapt and expand your strategy over time as your business needs evolve.
The following sections explore each business goal and associated use cases in detail.

Use Cases help you onboard quickly and efficiently to Segment by guiding you through specific steps tailored to your business needs.
This page walks you through the steps to set up a use case in your Segment instance.
Permissions
To implement a use case, you’ll need to be a Workspace Owner for your Segment account. See theRolesdocumentation for more information.
You can onboard to Segment with a Use Case if you’re a new Business Tier customer or haven’t yet connected a source and destination.
From a high level, setting Segment up with a use case takes place in four stages:
This section provides a detailed, step-by-step guide to setting up thePersonalize Winbackuse case from thePersonalize communications and product experiencesbusiness goal in your Segment account. All use cases follow this same setup flow.
Choosing a use case
Segment lets you implement one use case. If you’re not sure which use case to choose, viewChoosing a Use Case.
For most cases, you’ll want to start with development or staging sources to test and debug your Segment implementation. This approach lets you verify that everything is working correctly before sending live data downstream. To facilitate this, Segment automatically creates development (dev) and production (prod) spaces for you and labels your sources accordingly to simplify tracking.
Segment strongly recommends beginning your setup in the dev environment. This allows for thorough testing and debugging of your configuration. Once you’re confident in your dev setup, Segment will guide you on how to apply these configurations to your live production sources.
Changing your use case
Once you’ve reviewed the suggested events for a use case, you won’t be able to change the use case. If you want to see a full breakdown of each use case before commiting to one, clickChange use caseto begin the use case flow again. You can also view theUse Cases Reference guideto see what Segment recommends for each use case.
On theSetup checklistpage, you’ll see the full checklist for the use case you’ve chosen. This checklist applies to all use cases, though the suggested events, sources, and destinations differ between use cases.
This table shows Segment’s recommended events and properties for the Personalize winback use case:
Make sure that you’re tracking these events to get the most of the Personalize winback campaign. For more information on event tracking, seeData Collection Best Practices.
You’re now ready to connect sources to your dev environment.
Adding a warehouse as a souce
If you connect a warehouse as a source, Segment automatically creates a Profiles destination that shows up in theConnect your datatab. Do not delete this destination, as Segment requires this destination to create profiles from your warehouse.
Cloud object sources
If you connect a cloud object source, you’ll need to create a warehouse to sync profiles into Segment. For more information, seeCloud Sources.
With sources connected, you can now connect destinations to your dev environment.
Until this point, you’ve set up event tracking and connected sources and destinations to a development environment.
After you’ve confirmed that data is flowing from your sources into your destinations as expected, you’re ready to publish your setup to a production environment.
Your data is now in production, and you’ve successfully configured Segment.
Now that you’ve successfully set up Connections and Destinations, you can build upon your Segment implementation with Unify and Engage.
Accessing Unify and Engage
Unify and Engage may not yet be enabled for your account. To add Engage to your Segment workspace, clickRequest a demoin the Unify and Engage tabs on the Guided Setup page.
Your identifiers are now set up in your dev space, though it could take a few minutes for Segment to create profiles from your selected identifiers.
For more information, see theUnify documentation.
Segment then begins sending your new audience(s) to the destinations in your dev environment. Verify in those destinations that the audiences are coming through as intended, then clickMark complete.
For more information on Audiences, see theEngage documentation.
At this point, you’ll have already published your initial setup to a prod environment. Next, you’ll publish your Unify and Engage setup to the same prod environment.
Segment then begins sending your new audience(s) to the destinations in your dev environment. Verify in those destinations that your audiences are coming through as intended, then clickMark complete.
Use Cases pulls together a number of core Segment features, likeSources,Destinations,data collection, andReverse ETL. View the documentation for each to learn how you can continue to expand and build on what you’ve alreay achieved.

Crawling: https://segment.com/docs/guides/
Paragraphs:
On this page
Welcome! This page is a high-level introduction to the Segment Platform, including what it does and how. (If you’re looking for detailed information about architecture, setup, or maintenance, you canskip ahead.)
Segment is a Customer Data Platform (CDP), which means that it provide a service that simplifies collecting and using data from the users of your digital properties (websites, apps, etc). With Segment, you can collect, transform, send, and archive yourfirst-party customer data. Segment simplifies the process of collecting data and hooking up new tools, allowing you to spend more time using your data, and less time trying to collect it.
You can also enrich the customer data you collect by connecting data from your other tools, and then aggregate it to monitor performance, inform decision-making processes, and create uniquely customized user experiences. You can also use Unify, Segment’s identity resolution tool, to unify data from individual users to gain a wholistic understanding of their actions.
Check out how to get started with Segment in Segment University! (Must be logged in to access.)
In its very simplest form, Segment generates messages about what’s happening in your site or app, then translates the content of those messages into different formats for use by other tools (called ‘Destinations’), and transmits messages to those tools. The Segment servers also archive a copy of the data, and cansend data to your storage systems(such as databases, warehouses, or bulk-storage buckets).
Segment’s libraries generate and send messages to the tracking API in JSON format. Segment provides a standard structure for the basic API calls, along with a recommended JSON structure (also known as the ‘Spec’, a type of schema) that helps keep the most important parts of your data consistent, while allowing great flexibility in what other information you collect and where.
When you implement Segment, you add the Segment code to your website, app, or server, which generates messages based on specific triggers you define. At its very simplest, this code can be a snippet that you copy and paste into the HTML of a website to track page views. It can also be as complex as Segment calls embedded in a React mobile app to send messages when the app is opened or closed, when the user performs different actions, or when time based conditions are met (for example “ticket reservation expired” or “cart abandoned after 2 hours”).
Segment hasSourcesandDestinations. Sources send messagesintoSegment (and other tools), while Destinations receive messagesfromSegment.
The most basic Segment message requires only auserIDoranonymousID; all other fields are optional to allow for maximum flexibility. However, a normal Segment message has three main parts: thecommon fields, the“context” object, and the properties (if it’s an event) or traits (if it’s an object).
The common fields include information specific to how the call was generated, like the timestamp and library name and version. The fields in the context object are usually generated by the library, and include information about the environment in which the call was generated: page path, user agent, OS, locale settings, etc. The properties and traits are optional and are where you customize the information you want to collect for your implementation.
Another common part of a Segment message istheintegrationsobject, which you can use to explicitly filter which destinations the call is forwarded to. However this object is optional, and is often omitted in favor of non-code based filtering options.
Segment provides several types of Sources which you can use to collect your data, and which you can choose among based on the needs of your app or site. For websites, you can embed a library which loads on the page to create the Segment messages. If you have a mobile app, you can embed one of Segment’s Mobile libraries, and if you’d like to create messages directly on a server (if you have, for example a dedicated .NET server that processes payments), there are several server-based libraries that you can embed directly into your backend code. (You can also usecloud-sourcesto import data about your app or site from other tools like Zendesk or Salesforce, to enrich the data sent through Segment.)
Once Segment generates the messages, it can send them directly to the Segment servers for translation and forwarding on to the Destinations you’re using, or it can make calls directly from the app or site to the APIs of your Destination tools. Which of these methods you choose depends on which Destinations you’re using and other factors. You can read more about these considerations in ourConnection Modes documentation
Messages sent to the Segment servers using the tracking API can then be translated and forwarded on to Destination tools, inspected to make sure that they’re in the correct format or schema, inspected to make sure they don’t contain any Personally Identifying Information (PII), aggregated to illustrate overall performance or metrics, and archived for later analysis and reuse.
In addition toConnections(our core message routing product) Segment offers additional features to help your organization do more with its data, and keep data clean, consistent, and respectful of end-user privacy. The following products are available:
I’m a Segment Developer
I’m a Segment Data user
I’m a Segment Workspace administrator
A workspace is a group of sources that can be administered and billed together. Workspaces help companies manage access for multiple users and data sources. Workspaces let you collaborate with team members, add permissions, and share sources across your whole team using a shared billing account.
When you first log in to your Segment account, you can create a new workspace, or choose to log into an existing workspace if your account is part of an existing organization.
In Segment, you create a source (or more than one!) for each website or app you want to track. Wehighly recommendcreating a Source for each unique source of data (each site, app, or server), though this isn’t required.
Sources belong to a workspace, and the URL for a source looks something like this:https://segment.com/<my-workspace>/sources/<my-source-name>/
You can create new sources using the button in the workspace view. Each source you create has a write key, which is used to send data to that source. For example, to loadanalytics.js, the Segment JavaScript libraryon your page, the snippet on theQuickstart Guideincludes:
Destinations are business tools or apps that you can connect to the data flowing through Segment. Some of Segment’s most popular destinations are Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Kissmetrics, Customer.io, Intercom, and KeenIO.
All of these tools run on the same data: who are your customers and what are they doing? But each tool requires that you send that data in a slightly different format, which means that you’d have to write code to track all of this information, again and again, for each tool, on each page of your app or website.
Enter Segment. Do it once.
Segment eliminates this process by introducing an abstraction layer. You send your data to Segment, and Segment understands how to translate it so we can send it along to any destination. You enable destinations from the catalog in the Segment App, and user data immediately starts flowing into those tools. No extra code required!
Segment supports many categories of destinations, from advertising to marketing, email to customer support, CRM to user testing, and even data warehouses. You can view a complete list of availabledestinationsor check out thedestination pagefor a searchable list broken down by category.
A warehouse is a central repository of data collected from one or more sources. This is what commonly comes to mind when you think about a relational database: structured data that fits neatly into rows and columns.
In Segment, a Warehouse is a special type of destination. Instead of streaming data to the destination all the time, we load data to them in bulk at regular intervals. When we load data, we insert and update events and objects, and automatically adjust their schema to fit the data you’ve sent to Segment.

Get started with Segment
Crawling: https://segment.com/docs/guides/intro-impl/
Paragraphs:
On this page
This guide explains all you need to know to get started with your Segment implementation, and directs you to more resources depending on your specific needs.
If you haven’t already, you should read thedetailed explanation of Segmenton the previous page!
See a quick example of Segment working on an ecommerce website. (Must be logged in to access.)
Segment sends messages about activities in your mobile apps, websites or servers, receives those messages, and translates and forwards the message content to Destination tools. It also can send the contents of those messages to a bulk storage destination for archiving. In more complicated implementations, Segment can serve as a wrapper to trigger messages directly to other APIs, and can inspect, correct, classify and block the message contents.
Segment’s libraries generate and send messages to our tracking API in JSON format, and provide a standard structure for the basic API calls. We also provide recommended JSON structure (also known as a schema, or ‘Spec’) that helps keep the most important parts of your data consistent, while allowing great flexibility in what other information you collect and where.
There are six calls in the basic tracking API, which answer specific questions:
Among these calls, you can think of Identify, Group, and Alias as similar types of calls, all to do with updating our understanding of the user who is triggering Segment messages. You can think of these calls as adding information to, or updating an object record in a database.Objectsare described using “traits”, which you can collect as part of your calls.
The other three, Track, Page, and Screen, can be considered as increasingly specific types of events.Eventscan occur multiple times, but generate separate records which append to a list, instead of being updated over time.
A Track call is the most basic type of call, and can represent any type of event. Page and Screen are similar and are triggered by a user viewing a page or screen, however Page calls can come from both web and mobile-web views, while Screen callsonlyoccur on mobile devices. Because of the difference in platform, the context information collected is very different between the two types of calls.
Tip! Segment recommends that you always use the Page and Screen calls when recording a page-view, rather than creating a “Page Viewed” event, because the Page/Screen calls automatically collect much better context information.
The most basic Segment message requires only auserIDoranonymousID; all other fields are optional to allow for maximum flexibility. However, a normal Segment message has three main parts: thecommon fields, the“context” object, and the properties (if it’s an event) or traits (if it’s an object).
The common fields include information specific to how the call was generated, like the timestamp and library name and version. The fields in the context object are usually generated by the library, and include information about the environment in which the call was generated: page path, user agent, OS, locale settings, etc. The properties and traits are optional and are where you customize the information you want to collect for your implementation.
Another common part of a Segment message istheintegrationsobject, which you can use to explicitly filter which destinations the call is forwarded to. However this object is optional, and is often omitted in favor of non-code based filtering options.
The Segment “Specs” provide recommended message schemas - the information we recommend that you collect - for each type of call. These are recommendations not requirements, but if you follow these schema guidelines the Segment servers can more easily identify parts of your messages, and translate them to downstream tools.
In addition to the recommended message schemas, Segment also provides “blocks”: recommendations on what information to collect and how to format it, for different industries and use cases. These are recommendations only, but by collecting all of the information in these blocks, you can ensure that common tools used in that use-case have the information they need to function.
A third section of the Spec is the “industry specs” which provide recommendations that include an explicit translation or mapping in the Segment servers, to best power the downstream Destinations commonly used in these industries.
When you start out, you create a Workspace, which serves as a container for all of your Sources and Destinations.
Segment hasSourcesandDestinations. Sources send dataintoSegment, while Destinations receive datafromSegment.
Segment has five types of sources: Web (Analytics.js), Mobile, Server, and Cloud App, plus a fifth type: User-createdSource Functions. Web, Mobile, and Server sources send first-party data from your digital properties. Cloud-app sources send data about your users from your connected web apps, for example a ticketing system such asZendesk, a payments system such asStripe, or a marketing tool likeBraze.
Segment has several types of sources, and many destinations can accept data from all of them. However, some are only compatible with specific source types (for example, web only, or server only). To find out which source types a specific destination can accept data from, check the documentation for that destination for a “Supported Sources and Connection Modes” section.
Segment’s web source (Analytics.js), and native client-side libraries (iOS, Android, React-native) allow you to choose how you send data to Segment from your website or app. There are two ways to send data:
Cloud-mode: The sources send data directly to the Segment servers, which then translate it for each connected downstream destination, and send it on. Translation is done on the Segment servers, keeping your page size, method count, and load time small.
Healthcare and Life Sciences (HLS) customers can encrypt data flowing into their destinations
HLS customers with a HIPAA eligible workspace can encrypt data in fields marked as Yellow in the Privacy Portal before they flow into an event stream, cloud-mode destination.To learn more about data encryption, see theHIPAA Eligible Segment documentation
Device-mode: You include additional code on your website or mobile app which allows Segment to use the data you collect on the device to make calls directly to the destination tool’s API, without sending it to the Segment serversfirst. (You still send your data to the Segment servers, but this occurs asynchronously.) This is also calledwrappingorbundling, and it might be required when the source has to be loaded on the page to work, or loaded directly on the device to function correctly. When you use Analytics.js, you can change the device-mode destinations that a specific source sends from within the Segment web app, without touching any code.

If you use Server source libraries, they only send data directly to Segment in Cloud-mode. Server library implementations operate in the server backend, and can't load additional destination SDKs.
To learn more about connection modes and when you should use each, see thedetails in the Destinations docs.
The journey of a thousand miles begins, ideally, with a plan. Regardless of if you’re a new company just implementing analytics for the first time, or a multi–national corporation modernizing your analytics stack, it’s a great idea tostart with a Tracking Plan. For new implementations, this can be as simple as a document where you write down these four things for each item you track:
If you’re a large or long-established organization and you’re replacing existing tools, you’ll want to spend more time on this to maintain analytic parity and continuity of tooling. We highly recommendreading up on tracking plansandschemasforProtocols, our tool for managing and sharing tracking plans and enforcing schemas.
Regardless of your organization’s size or age, you’ll want to take an inventory of the destination tools you’ll be using with Segment, and make a list of the connection modes each one accepts. This makes it easier to check off when you’ve implemented each one, so you’re not missing anything.
There are several ways to check if your data is flowing. One is theDebugger tab in each Sourcein the Segment web app, where you can see data coming from a source into Segment. Another is theEvent Delivery toolwhich shows which data is arriving at specific destinations.
For monitoring purposes, you’ll also see alerts in theWorkspace Healthtool if your sources or destinations produce repeated errors.
There are several different ways to ensure that you can collect your data once, but filter it out of specific destinations. SeeFiltering Datafor a list of the available methods and descriptions.
If you’re seeing errors thrown by your destinations, you might have an implementation issue. See theIntegration Error Codes listorcontact our Success engineering teamfor help.

If you aren’t involved in setting up your Segment implementation, or are just starting to set up Destinations for your organization’s workspace, this guide is for you.
If you read thedetailed explanation of Segmenton the previous page, you can skip ahead!
Segment is a system for sending messages from your websites, mobile apps, and servers. These messages contain data about events on, or users of those systems, and these messages can sent on to other tools, and gathered together in a warehouse for later analysis. Segment can also bring in information about your users from external systems, such as helpdesks or CRM systems, and collate that information to help you analyze your data, build audiences of users, and personalize your users’ experiences.
Once you (or your organizations’ developers) have your Segment Sources set up and sending data, you can log in to the Segment App and set up Destinations, which are how Segment sends that data to other tools (like Google Analytics, Mixpanel, and many others).
Depending on your organization’s configuration and access settings, you might be able to see one or multiple Environments (for example, “Production”, “Testing”, “Development”), or one or multipleLabels, which control access to different parts of your organization’s Segment system.  If you see several environments, contact your Segment administrator for more details so you can make sure you make your changes in the right place.
Data enters the Segment systems from Sources, but once data is in the system, your organization may have different tools configured to control and change it. This could change what data is available to you, or any destinations you set up.
For example, Protocols makes sure that data coming into Segment follows specific formats and patterns, and might block and discard malformed or unwanted data. The Privacy tool can be configured to remove Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from the data. And several different methods are available tofilter dataso that it doesn’t send certain types of events, or reach specific destinations or warehouses.
Depending on the access level you have in your organization’s Segment workspace, you might be able to create new Destinations, or you might only be able to edit existing ones.
To add a new Destination, you’ll usually need some information (such as a token or API key) from the destination tool to start. You’ll enter that into the Segment App so we can connect to and send data to that tool. You’ll also need to know which Source you’ll be sending data from.
To set up a destination:
Tip: Segment usually is able to translate data into a format that the destination expects, however some destinations (such as Adobe Analytics) may require manual mapping steps to configure properly. If you see additional fields for mapping configuration, read the documentation for that destination to learn more.
If you’re setting up a destination to usecloud-mode data(data that’s sent through Segment, rather than directly from a user’s device), you can use theEvent TesterandEvent Deliverytools to check that data is arriving, and being correctly delivered to the destination.

If your job is to set up or maintain a Segment Workspace for your organization, or assist other people using the Segment Web App, this guide is for you. If you’re more interested in Segment implementation details, see thedeveloper intro guide.
If you’ve already readan Introduction to Segment, you can skip ahead.
Segment is a system for sending messages from your websites, mobile apps, and servers. These messages contain event and user data that you can send to other tools or collect in warehouses for further analysis. Segment also gathers information about your users from external systems, like help desk software or CRMs. You can use this collated information to analyze data, build user audiences, and personalize your users’ experiences.
A workspace is a group of sources that can be administered and billed together. Workspaces help companies manage access for multiple users and data sources. Workspaces let you collaborate with team members, add permissions, and share sources across your whole team using a shared billing account.
When you first log in to your Segment account, you can create a new workspace, or choose to log into an existing workspace if your account is part of an existing organization.
You don’t have to be a developer to be a Workspace administrator for an organization, and this guide only covers tasks specifically related to managing a Workspace in theSegment App.
However, many Workspace admins are also involved in the Segment implementation process as there are usually some tasks that must be performed in the Workspace to complete an implementation. If you think you might develop a Segment implementation or help out other developers, first readSegment for developers.
Note: Workspace roles are only available to Business Tier customers. If you’re on a Free or Team plan, all workspace members are granted workspace administrator access.
In addition, Workspace administrators set up and maintain the organization’sworkspace settings, which include:
Changing a workspace name and slug won’t impact configured sources or destinations, which connect using an internal ID andwriteKey.
Workspace administrators might also maintain:
As an administrator, you might be asked to help other members of your organization with tasks related to setting up and troubleshooting your Segment implementation.
Destinations are the endpoints to which Segment sends data flowing from your Sources. Destinations can be third-party external tools, like Google Analytics or Mixpanel, or bulk-storage resources, like warehouses.
You can set up a Destination from within the Segment App by navigating to theDestination Catalogand selecting the tool you want to set up. In most cases, you’ll need an existing API key or token so that Segment can send the data to the correct account. If you’re setting up a Warehouse or other storage destination, more steps might be required; see theWarehouses documentationfor more details.

Crawling: https://segment.com/docs/guides/filtering-data/
Paragraphs:
On this page
There are many ways you can use Segment to filter event and object based data to control which destinations it reaches. This document lists the most commonly used ways you can filter data in Segment, and explains when you’d use each.

The Integrations object is the only filtering method that cannot be edited using the Segment web app. As such, it is both the most reliable, and the most complicated filtering option to change. The integrations object is available to all customers regardless of Segment plan.
Use this option when you absolutely, for sure, 100% know that youalways, orneverwant this data in a specific destination or set of destinations. You can also build logic in your app or site to conditionally enable or disable destinations by rewriting this object, however this is not recommended as it is time consuming to change, especially for mobile apps.
The Integrations object filterstrack,page,group,identify, andscreenevents from both client and cloud based sources, and routes or prevents them from getting to the listed destinations.
You can use theintegrationsJSON object as part of your Segment payloads to control how Segment routes your data to specific destinations. An example payload is below:
Bydefault, theintegrationsobject is set to'All': true. You do not need to include this flag in the object to use this behavior, but if you’ll be using the integrations object frequently to control destination filtering, you might want to do this to make it explicit for later readers. Change this to'All': falseto prevent any downstream destinations from receiving data, not including data warehouses. If you set'Segment.io': falsein the integrations object, Analytics.js 2.0 drops the event before it reaches your Source Debugger. You can also add destinations to the object by key, and provide atrueorfalsevalue to allow or disallow data to flow to them on an individual basis. The Destination Info box at the top of each destination page lets you know how to refer to each destination in the Integrations object.
If you are usingmultiple instances of a destination, any settings you set in the integrations object are applied to all instances of the destination. You cannot specify an instance of a destination to apply Integrations object settings to.
Note that destination flags arecase sensitiveand match the destination’s name in the docs (for example, “AdLearn Open Platform”, “awe.sm”, or “MailChimp”).
The syntax to filter data to a data warehouse is different. Refer to theWarehouse FAQsfor more details.
Destination filtersallow you to control the data flowing into each specific destination, by examining event payloads, and conditionally preventing data from being sent to destinations. You can filter out entire events, or just specific fields in the properties, in the traits, or in the context of your events. Destination filters support cloud-based (server-side), actions-based, and mobile and web device-mode destinations.  Destination filters aren’t available for, and don’t prevent data from reaching your warehouse(s) or S3 destinations.
Destination filters are only available in workspaces that are on a Business Tier plan.
Keepthese limitationsin mind when using destination filters.

To set up destination filters from the Segment web app for the destination from which you want to exclude data:
You can set up destination filters using the options presented in the Segment web app, or using Segment’s Filter Query Logic (FQL). If you use FQL, your query syntax is limited to 5KB per query.
Integration filters allow you to quickly change which destinations receive specific Track, Identify, or Group events. Access this tool in any Source that is receiving data by navigating to the Schema tab. Schema integration filters are available to workspaces that are on a Business Tier plan only.
You can apply Integrations filters to specific events regardless of whether the source is connected to a Tracking Plan. To update which destination an event can be sent to, click theIntegrationsdropdown menu to see a list of the destinations each call is sent to. You can turn those destinations on or off from within the dropdown menu.

The events filtered out of individual destinations using this method still arrive in your data warehouse(s). Warehouses do not appear in the integration filters dropdown, and you cannot prevent data from flowing to Warehouses using this feature - to do that useWarehouse Selective Sync.
Integration filters are all-or-nothing for each event.If you require more detailed control over which events are sent to specific destinations, you can use Destination Filters to inspect the event payload, and conditionally drop the data or forward it to the destination.
Integration filters won’t override an existing value in the integrations object.If the integration object already has a value for the integration, the per source schema integration filters will not override this. For example, if you’re sending events to Appsflyer with theappsflyerIdpassed into the integration object:
For the same event you have Appsflyer turned off using the per source schema integrations filter, this filter won’t override the above object with a false value, and events still send downstream. In this scenario, you can usedestination filtersto drop the event before it sends downstream.
You can use Schema Event Filters to discard and permanently remove Page, Screen and Track events from event-based sources, preventing them from reaching any destinations or warehouses, as well as omit identify traits and group properties. Use this if you know that you’ll never want to access this data again. This functionality is similar to filtering with the Integrations object, however it can be changed from within the Segment app without touching any code.
When you enable these filters, Segment stops forwarding the data to all of your Cloud- and device-mode destinations, including warehouses, and your data is no longer stored in Segment’s warehouses for later replay.
Use this when you need to disable an event immediately, but may need more time to remove it from your code, or when you want to temporarily disable an event for testing. In addition to blocking track calls, you can block all page and screen calls, as well as omit identify traits and group properties.
If the Source is not connected to a tracking plan, you’ll find event filter toggles next to the Integration filters in the source’s schema tab. When an event is set to block, the entire event is blocked. This means no destinations receive it, including data warehouses.
When you block an event using Schema filters, it won’t be considered in the MTU count unless blocked event forwarding is enabled.

When an event is blocked, the name of the event or property appears on your Schema page with a counter which shows how many times it has been blocked. By default, data from blocked events and properties is not recoverable. You can always re-enable the event to continue sending it to downstream destinations.
In most cases, blocking an event immediately stops that event from sending to destinations. In rare cases, it can takeup to 6 hoursfor an event to completely stop arriving in all Destinations.
This feature is only available if the Source is not connected to a Tracking Plan, and is only available in workspaces that are on a Business Tier plan.
If you’re using Protocols, and you’re confident that your tracking plan includes exactly the events and properties you want to record, you can tell Segment toblock unplanned events or malformed JSON. When you do this, Segment discards any data coming from the Source that doesn’t conform to the tracking plan.
By default, the blocked events are permanently discarded: they do not flow to Destinations, and cannot be Replayed (similar to Schema Controls). However, you can opt to send data in violation of the tracking plan to a new Segment Source so you can monitor it. (This source can affect your MTU count.)
If you have Protocols in your workspace,andhave a tracking plan associated with the Source, you’ll see additional options in the Schema Configuration section of the Source’s Settings page. From this page you can choose how to handle data violations across different types of calls and properties, whether that be blocking events entirely or omitting violating properties.

A customizable way to filter or alter data going from a source to a cloud-mode destination is to useInsert Functions). This feature gives you the ability to receive data from your Segment source, write custom code to alter or block it, and then pass that altered payload to a downstream cloud-mode destination.
Warehouse Selective Sync allows you to stop sending specific data to specific warehouses. You can use this to stop syncing specific events or properties that aren’t relevant, and could be slowing down your warehouse syncs. See theWarehouse Selective Sync documentationto learn more.
This feature is only available to Business Tier customers, and you must be a Workspace Owner to change Selective Sync settings.
ThePrivacy Portalis available to all Segment customers, because Segment believes that data privacy is a right, and that anyone collecting data should have tools to help ensure their users’ privacy. More enhancements are available to BT customers who may need tools for managing complex implementations.
The Privacy Portal tools allow you to inspect your incoming calls and their payloads, detect potential Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in properties using matchers, classify the information by different categories of risk, and use those categories to determine which Destinations may or may not receive the data. Learn more about these features in thePrivacy Portal documentation.

Crawling: https://segment.com/docs/guides/duplicate-data/
Paragraphs:
On this page
Segment guarantees that 99% of your data won’t have duplicates within an approximately 24 hour look-back window. Warehouses and Data Lakes also have their own secondary deduplication process to ensure you store clean data.
Segment has a special deduplication service that sits behind theapi.segment.comendpoint and attempts to drop 99% of duplicate data. Segment stores at least 24 hours’ worth of eventmessageIds, which allows Segment to deduplicate any data that appears with the samemessageIdwithin the stored values.
Segment deduplicates on the event’smessageId,noton the contents of the event payload. Segment doesn’t have a built-in way to deduplicate data for events that don’t generatemessageIds. The message de-duplication is not scoped to a specific source or a workspace, and applies to all events being received by Segment.
Keep in mind that Segment’s libraries all generatemessageIds for each event payload, with the exception of the Segment HTTP API, which assigns each event a uniquemessageIdwhen the message is ingested. You can override these default generated IDs and manually assign amessageIdif necessary. ThemessageIdfield is limited to 100 characters.
Duplicate events that are more than 24 hours apart from one another deduplicate in the Warehouse. Segment deduplicates messages going into a Warehouse (including Profiles Sync data) based on themessageId, which is theidcolumn in a Segment Warehouse.
To ensure clean data in your Data Lake, Segment removes duplicate events at the time your Data Lake ingests data. The Data Lake deduplication process dedupes the data the Data Lake syncs within the last 7 days with Segment deduping the data based on themessageId.

Paragraphs:
On this page
If you stumbled onto this page by accident and don’t know what a bot is or are just curious to learn more, the following Wikipedia article provides an awesome summary:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot.
Surprisingly, more than half of all web traffic is made up of bots. While a fraction of them are good bots with a regulated pattern, and therefore beneficial to all online businesses, the majority of them have malicious intents and are mostly unregulated.
Segment doesn’t offer an out-of-the-box solution to filter or ignore bot traffic.
As such, you generally have two options:
Handle the filtering at a destination-level:Some of Segment’s destination partners,like Mixpanel, filter bots automatically. Whereas otherssuch as Hubspotallow you to set up bot filtering manually. The advantage of filtering bots at a destination level is that it allows you to implement a robust, easy-to-maintain solution. However, as it pertains to Segment, the downside is that bot traffic willstillmake it to Segment,affecting your MTU count.
Write custom logic that suppresses bot activity from being sent to Segment:if you want to prevent bot traffic from making it to Segment in the first place, another option is to write your own custom code. The logic, in pseudo-code, would look something like this if you know a particular characteristic of the bot traffic to filter out, such as the userAgent:
The benefit here is that you would be able to limit the impact that bots have on your MTU count. On the flip side, it’s much harder to implement and maintain a custom filter.
As a matter of policy, Segment doesn’t provide refunds for bot-related MTU spikes, as bot traffic is out of Segment’s control. However for extenuating circumstances,you can petition for a refund, assuming you’re able to provide proof of the bot’s effect.
Segment uses Amazon’s hosting services, which are based in Boardman, Oregon. Howevermany bots also originate from AWS in Boardman as well.
One way you can confirm whether or not traffic is coming from Segment vs. a bot is to check the userAgent of the inbound call. Segment’s is:

Crawling: https://segment.com/docs/guides/segment-vs-tag-managers/
Paragraphs:
Tag managers, also known as Tag Management Systems (TMS), were a popular solution before the mainstream adoption of mobile apps. They primarily helped Digital Analytics and Online Marketers manage web tags or “beacons” on a website.
Built on an older technology, tag managers inject either a piece of JavaScript or an ad pixel into a website. They carry out rules that marketers create for each tag, like firing an ad channel pixel when that network refers a website visitor. Every tag requires users to create rules. No data is stored, and no code is eliminated.
In addition to ad networks, today’s data-driven businesses use a variety of tools to optimize their product and marketing spends. In order to a/b test copy, nurture sales leads, email customers, and provide fast support, businesses integrate variety of analytics and marketing tools. Segment makes it easy to install, try, and use them all. Tag managers primarily focus on ad networks, and can’t support modern tools without extensive customization.
Rather than “firing and forgetting,” Segment takes a data-centric, deliberate approach to destinations. You don’t need to set up special parameters for each tool – Segment does that for you. Segment structures your data so we can understand what it is, and can translate it correctly for each destination we send it to.  Segment works becauseall of these toolsoperate on the same customer data: who is on your app and what are they doing. Segment collects this data once, then translates and sends it to every tool you use. Because Segment also archives the data, Segment canreplay your historical datainto new tools, and send your raw data to adata storage solutionfor later analysis.
Every organization’s data stack and business requirements are unique. Segment also works well in tandem with a tag manager. For example, Segment sends data directly to theGoogle Tag Manager (GTM) destination.
While you can use Segment’s Analytics.js library through a tag manager, Segment doesn’t recommended this for a few reasons:
A hybrid approach makes it difficult to determine the root cause of technical problems, and complicates troubleshooting. Segment cannot guarantee destination compatibility in a “hybrid” Segment-tag-manager installation, and cannot guarantee support on these installations. All QA and regression testing assumes a native installation of Analytics.js on the page.
One of Segment’s main charters is to not lose data. Our system and cloud infrastructure is designed to ensure that data loss does not happen. If you implement the entry point of data capture (Segment’s libraries) using a Tag Manager, you introduce risk of data loss and make it difficult or impossible to troubleshoot.
This implementation behind a tag manager can introduce major delays and performance issues, which can cause delays with events that need to occur early in your funnel.
The biggest challenge is around triggering cascading events. Browsers are notorious for dropping calls. When you use a TMS to initiate Segment events you are introducing a second point of failure for those events.

Paragraphs:
Replay is available to all Business plans.See theavailable plans, orcontact Support.
On this page
Replay takes an archived copy of your Segment data, and re-sends it to new or existing tools providing huge benefits to mature data systems. By archiving and replaying data, you can avoid vendor lock-in, and protect your system against data loss.
With Replays, you can send your existing data to new tools.
This means you can send a limited sample of your data to a new tool to test it out, and run similar tools in parallel to verify the data format or accuracy of the output. Finally, when you’re ready to switch to a new tool, you can replay a full set of your data to the new tool to backfill it with data that extends before you set up the tool - no warm-up time or operational gap to disrupt your work.
Note
Any destinations which accept cloud-mode data (meaning data from Segment, and not directly from users’ devices) can use replay, however they must also process timestamps on the data for replay to be useful.
With Replays, you’re protected from outages and errors. If a destination which you rely on experiences an outage, or is temporarily unable to accept incoming data, you can use Replays to re-send data to that tool once the service recovers. You can also use Replays to recover from errors caused by misconfigurations in your Segment systems. For example, if you send data in the wrong format, or want to applydestination filters. In this case, you can change your mapping using a destination filter, clear out the bad data, and replay it to that destination. You can also use this to update the schema in your data warehouse when it changes.
For more information,Contact usand our Success Engineers will walk you through the process.
Replays are currently only available for Business Tier customers, and due to their complex nature are not self-serve.Contact usto learn more, or to request a replay for your workspace. When requesting a replay, include the workspace, the source to replay from, the destination tool or tools, and the time period.
Replays can process unlimited data, but they’re rate limited to respect limitations in downstream partner tools. If you’re also sending data to the destination being replayed to in real time, then, when determining your replay’s limit, you’ll want to take into account the rate limit being used by real-time events. You should also account for a small margin of your rate limit to allow events to be retried.
Replay time depends both on the tool Segment replays to and the amount of data included in the replay.
Replays do not affect yourMTU count, unless you are using aRepeater destination. Notify your team before initiating a Replay if you’re using a Repeater destination.
Once a replay starts, you will not see replayed events in the Event Delivery tab.
You can initiate replays for some or all events, but you can’t apply conditional filters that exclude certain rows of data from being replayed. You can set updestination filtersto conditionally filter replayed events.
The destination is not required to be enabled in order for a replay to be successful, including Destination Functions.
Replays are available for any destinations which support cloud-mode data (meaning data routed through Segment) and which also process timestamps. Destinations that are only available in device-mode (meaning where data is sent directly from the users’ devices to the destination tool) cannot receive Replays.
Not all destinations support data deduplication, so you may need to delete, archive, or remove any older versions of the data before initiating a replay.contact Segment supportif you have questions or want help.
Replays are subject to theDestination Filtersyou’ve configured on that destination. For example, if you request that Identify calls be included in the replay, but your destination has a Destination Filter that blocks Identify events, the filter then blocks all Identify events from making it to the destination. In this case, Segment recommends that you avoid including Identify events in the replay if you know they’ll be blocked by the destination filter.
When you request a replay, Segment asks you to provide a list of the events (type and/or name) that you want included in the replay. If you specify a list of events, then Segment only includes those specified events in the replay. If you need to exclude events in your replay,contact Segment support. The Segment team can help you handle filtering you’re unable to do in the replay.
There are two types of replays with Engage.
Replay a Profile Source’s data into Engage Space, (sending a standard source’s data into an Engage Space), which can be configured to send over a specified timeframe as well as the ability to specify all or only a specific subset of events by type or name.
Replay from an Engage Space to its connected destination, (sending data from an Engage Output Source to its connected destination), which includes all the computational data (Audiences, Computed Traits, Journeys) that destination is currently configured to receive, which can be configured to send over a specified timeframe as well as the ability to specify all or only a specific subset of events by type or name.
1. Replay a Profile Source’s data into Engage Space
2. Replay from an Engage Space to its connected destination

Regional Segment is available to customers on the Business Tier plan.See theavailable plans, orcontact Support.

On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted the Adequacy Decision for the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF). This concludes that EU personal data transferred to the United States under the DPF is adequately protected when compared to the protection in the EU. With this adequacy decision in place, personal data can safely flow from the EU to US companies participating in the DPF without additional safeguards in place.
Twilio is certified under the DPF and relies on the DPF as its primary personal data transfer mechanism for EU-US personal data transfer. Twilio will rely on the DPF for any Swiss-US personal data transfers as soon as a corresponding Swiss adequacy decision is made. Twilio understands that interpretations of data residency are multi-faceted and some customers might still want their data to reside in the EU. Twilio Segment therefore offers a data residency solution outside of the DPF.
Segment offers customers the option to lead on data residency by providing regional infrastructure in both Europe and the United States. The default region for all users is in Oregon, United States. You can configure workspaces to use the EU West Data Processing Region to ingest (for supported sources), process, filter, deduplicate, and archive data through Segment-managed archives hosted in AWS S3 buckets located in Dublin, Ireland. The regional infrastructure has the samerate limits and SLAas the default region.
To ensure a smooth transition from a US-based Segment workspace to an EU workspace, Segment will provide additional support and tooling to help with the transition later this year. Use the form link below to provide more information about your current setup and goals for transitioning.
The Segment UI doesn’t support moving workspaces between regions. To request help with this move,complete the Data Residency Workspace Provisioning Flow form.
Click to access the form
Regional Data Ingestion enables you to send data to Segment from both Device-mode and Cloud-mode sources through regionally hosted API ingest points. The regional infrastructure can fail-over across locations within a region, but never across regions.
The following cloud sources are supported in EU workspaces:
You can configure Segment’s client-side SDKs for JavaScript, iOS, Android, and React Native sources to send data to a regional host after you’ve updated the Data Ingestion Region in that source’s settings. Segment’s EU instance only supports data ingestion from Dublin, Ireland with theevents.eu1.segmentapis.com/endpoint. If you are using the Segment EU endpoint with an Analytics-C# source, you must manually appendv1to the URL. For instance,events.eu1.segmentapis.com/v1.
For workspaces that use the EU West Data Processing region, the Dublin Ingestion region is preselected for all sources.
To set your Data Ingestion Region:
All regions are configured on aper-sourcebasis. You’ll need to configure the region for each source separately if you don’t want to use the default region.
All Segment client-side SDKs read this setting and update themselves automatically to send data to new endpoints when the app reloads. You don’t need to change code when you switch regions.
When you send data from a server-side or project source, you can use thehostconfiguration parameter to send data to the desired region:
If you are using the Segment EU endpoint with an Analytics-C# source, you must manually appendv1to the URL. For instance,events.eu1.segmentapis.com/v1.
Here is an example of how to set the host:
Usethis formif you need to transition from your existing US-based workspace to an EU workspace.
To create a workspace with a different data processing region, reach out your Segment account executive, and they will assist you with enabling the feature. Once the feature has been enabled, you’ll be able to self-serve and create a new workspace in a different data processing region by following these steps:
Once you create a workspace with a specified data processing region, you can’t change the region. You must create a new workspace to change the region.
Regional Segment in the EU changes the way youconfigure the Segment Data Lakes (AWS) environment
Use Segment’s custom CIDR3.251.148.96/29while authorizing Segment to write in to your Redshift or Postgres port.BigQuerydoesn’t require you to allow a custom IP address.
Regional Segment is currently limited to the EU. Future expansion of Regional Segment beyond the EU is under evaluation by Segment Product and R&D.
Edge proxies are deprecated. Customers using Regional Endpoints may see US-based IP addresses in event payloads, Segment recommends using the US-based endpoint (api.segment.io) to preserve client IP addresses. For EU customers, Segment recommends using a Regionalized EU workspace.
Don't see a regional endpoint for a tool you're using?
As more of the partner tools you use (Sources, Destinations, and Warehouses) start to support a regional endpoint, Segment will update this list. Your contact for that tool should have a timeline for when they’re hoping to support regional data ingestion. You can also visit Segment’ssupport pagefor any Segment-related questions.
The following integrations marked with a(checkmark) support EU Regional endpoints.
Integrations available in EU workspaces do not guarantee data residency
Before you configure an integration, you should check directly with the integration partner to determine if they offer EU endpoints.

Don't see regional support for a source you're using?
As more of the partner Sources start to support posting data to our regional endpoint, Segment will update this list. Your contact for that tool should have a timeline for when they’re hoping to support regional data ingestion. You can also visit Segment’ssupport pagefor any Segment-related questions.
The following Sources marked with a(checkmark) are supported in EU workspaces.

Audiences, Journeys, and Broadcasts are fundamental toTwilio Engageand let you segment your users, send them personalized content, and show them ads from platforms like Facebook or Google.
In this guide, you’ll learn how to choose between an Audience, a Journey, and a Broadcast for a number of marketing use cases across the customer lifecycle.
First, consider the following definitions for an Audience, Journey, and Broadcast.
In Engage, anAudienceis a group of users that share certain characteristics. When you create an Audience, you group users who meet certain conditions, like having performed an event or having aComputed Trait.
Once you’ve created an Audience, you can sync it tomarketing automation tools,ads platforms,analytics tools, ordata warehouses. Depending on the Audience’s conditions andconnected Destination(s), Segment syncs the Audience’s users in batches or in real time, as they meet the Audience’s conditions.
AJourneyis a logic-driven workflow that progresses users through steps based on conditions and time delays. You add users to a Journey with an entry condition, then users progress throughthe Journey’s stepsbased on conditions you define during Journey setup.
As with Audiences, Segment can sync users to Destinations at designated points in the Journey. Unlike an Audience, a Journey can send users to Twilio Engage’snative email and SMS channels.
ABroadcastis a one-time SMS or email campaign sent to a group of users. Whereas Segment continously updates Audience membership, Segment only calculates the users who will receive your Broadcast once. Marketers commonly use Broadcasts for newsletters, promotional campaign, and events.
The customer lifecycle provides a helpful framework for thinking about Audiences, Journeys, and Broadcasts.

Audiences and Broadcasts tend to be most effective at the top of the customer lifecycle funnel, where brand awareness and discovery occurs.
A Journey becomes a better option as customers progress down the funnel, where a more complex strategy involving messaging, social ads, and newsletters helps move customers closer to conversion.
With the customer lifecycle in mind, use the following table as a starting point for selecting an Audience or Journey for common marketing use cases:
While these suggestions will work for most use cases, you may need to consider other factors before you implement your own campaign. Asking the following questions will help you identify the right approach.
Audiences and Broadcasts work best for single, one-off messages or touchpoints. If you need a campaign with time delays and branching logic, opt for a Journey.
For example, an Audience works well if you want to show a single ad when a user abandons a cart. If, however, you want to show an ad, wait several days, then send the user an email if they’ve not completed their purchase, go with a Journey.
You can message users withEngage Premier Channels. If you’d like to send an SMS or email campaign to a customer, use a Journey.
Create a Journey if you want to incorporate branching logic into your campaign.
A number of Journeys step types, likerandomized splits, let you run experiments and test your campaigns. If you want to experiment with different groups, use a Journey.
With Journeys, you can allow customers tore-enter a Journey they’ve exitedor restrict them to a one-time Journey.
Audiences, on the other hand, admit users whenever they meet the Audience’s criteria. For example, you may want to retarget a user with an ad whenever they view a page on your website. In this case, an Audience works well since the user can re-enter the Audience regardless of how many times they’ve already done so.
With this guidance in mind, take your next steps with Engage by learninghow to build a Journey,work with Engage Audiences, andsend a Broadcast.

Compelling and engaging brands delight their customers at every interaction. As customers move seamlessly across channels—such as email, push notifications, display ads—brands must similarly meet them with tailored and consistent messages.
With Segment, you can craft a tailored message while using a combination of AdRoll, Customer.IO, and other tools to dynamically switch between channels.
Talk to a product specialist todayabout using data to tailor your brand experience.
Retargeting withAdRoll:AdRoll is a retargeting and prospecting tool that allows you to show display ads to a behaviorally-defined cohort
Push notifications withBraze:Braze is a multi-channel marketing campaign focused on the mobile experience
Emails withCustomer.io:Customer.io is a flexible email provider that allows you to create cohorts based on customer actions. You can build complex onboarding emails, nurture email campaigns, as well as marketing automation workflows.
There are other email tools on Segment’s platform, such asBronto,SendGrid,andMailchimp.Check out thefull list of email tools.
It’s important to register for these tools and enable them on your Segment source project. When Segment collects tracking data, it’ll also route it to all of your enabled tools. Then your tools, especially ones like Customer.io, Braze, and AdRoll, where you can define cohorts of your users, will be working off a dynamic, yet consistent data set. This is paramount in getting the dynamic messaging to update accordingly.

When you send tracking data from your app or website to Segment, Segment will send the same data to all of your tools. Segment also collects key messaging events like Push Notification Opened and Email Opened from Braze and Customer.io, respectively, and sends that to other tools. By defining cohorts based on these events, you can create dynamic campaign audiences, to which customers can add and remove themselves.
In each of your destinations—Braze, Facebook, Customer.io, AdRoll—you can create custom campaigns to show display ads or send emails to a specific segment of users who have performed (or not performed) a given action, or “event.” In this cross-channel re-engagement example, we’ll start with push notifications.
In Braze, create a segment of customers who added a product to their cart, but did not check out. The segment definition, in this case, should be people who have performedProduct Added, but have not performedOrder Completed. Send a push notification to these customers with a message that the cart was abandoned and that they can complete the transaction with, for example, a 10% coupon.

Because Segment automatically collects second-party data from Braze, you now also have push notification event data, likePush Notification OpenedandPush Notification Receivedin Segment. You can use thepropertieson each of these events to define a property calledcampaign_nameso you can tie these activities to a given campaign.

This is helpful because now, you can define segments in Customer.io for customers who have triggeredPush Notification Received, but notPush Notification Opened. You’ve now automated the process of targeting customers who don’t open your push notifications. In Customer.io, you can create a campaign that sends an email to those people asking them to check their push notifications and offering them a coupon to complete their order.
Since Segment collects email event data, likeEmail Opened, from Customer.io, you can similarly create segments in Facebook Ads and AdRoll for when customers don’t open your email. Create a segment where users have anEmail Deliveredevent, but noEmail Openedevent. When users meet these criteria, they’ll get automatically added to your retargeting campaigns. You can then serve them custom creatives about them neglecting to open your emails and, again, perhaps offer them a coupon to complete the transaction.

When users do not open an activation email, add them to a specific retargeting campaign that contains messaging to remind them to activate.
With Segment, automate not just switching across channels, but also the messaging in each channel so that the entire experience is cohesive. The added benefit is that we can create specifically targeted retargeting campaigns for people who no longer open our emails or push notifications. Automating these processes with Segment makes channel-switching more seamless for your customers.
This is just a simple cart abandonment example that dynamically follows customers as they switch between channels. Because Segment collects and routes the second party data of emails and push notifications being opened, you can create specific campaigns with messaging that targets your customers as they interact with your brand.
With over 200+ different tools on Segment’s platform, you can take this idea and create other tailored shopping experiences to re-engage your customers.

Crawling: https://segment.com/docs/guides/how-to-guides/collect-on-client-or-server/
Paragraphs:
One of the most common questions Segment receives is: “Should I use one of your client-side libraries or one of your server-side libraries?”
This is such an important topic that you’ll find an in-depth article in Segment’s Analytics Academy:When to Track on the Client vs Server. It’s worth a read. Below, you can also read some quick logic around why you may want to choose either option.
Good things to send from the client-side are things that you wouldn’t usually store in your database. Things like page views, button clicks, page scroll length, mouse movements, social shares, and likes.
Things like UTM tags, operating system, device type, or cookied data like returning visitors are all easiest to track client-side. Of course, some things like mouse movements are only available on the client-side so you should definitely track that there.
Some destinations can only accept data when the event is sent from the browser. They require events on the client since they rely on cookies and most of those tools do not have an API that Segment can send server-side data to. More on this in Segment’sAnalytics.js docs.
Charging customers often happens when they aren’t online, and accuracy for payments is so important. Server-side tracking tends to be more accurate than user devices since it’s a more controlled environment.
In general client-side data is fine for watching general trending, but it’s never going to be perfect. Especially if your customers are likely to use things like adblock or old/non-standard browsers.
For example, if you’re sending triggered emails based on events, it’s probably a good idea to make sure your user profiles are sent through Segment’s servers so no one gets left out or mis-emailed.
Another good type of data to send server-side are things that need to be calculated from a database query. This might be something like “Friend Count” if your site or app is a social network.
Sensitive information is also best kept out of browsers. Any data you don’t want exposed to users should be sent server-side.
Each Segment library allows anintegrationsobject either as a top level object or nested in options object.
This flag may be especially useful in Legacy source types, where an event might be triggered on both the client and server for various reasons. The following will cause the payload to be sent to all enabled toolsexceptFacebook Pixel:

Crawling: https://segment.com/docs/guides/how-to-guides/collect-pageviews-serverside/
Paragraphs:
Segment believes that client-side collection is appropriate for collection of basic pageviews.
If you’d like to trackpagecalls from your server to Segment, Segment recommends doing it in addition to any client side tracking you’re doing with analytics.js, and doing it in a separate “source” so that you can configure where to send the (probably redundant, albeit higher-fidelity) data.
With this approach, you might use a request “middleware” to log apageviewwith every page load from your server.
There are a few things to be mindful of if you want to make sure you can attribute these (anonymous) page views to the appropriate user in your client-side source (eg, for effectively joining these tables together to do down-funnel behavioral attribution). You’ll want to ensure they share ananonymousIdby respecting one if it’s already there, and setting it yourself if not. To do that, you can read and modify theajs_anonymous_idcookie value in the request.
Be sure to pass through as many fields as you can in Segment’sPageandCommonspec, so that you get full functionality in any downstream tools you choose to enable. Segment recommends specifically ensuring you pass theurl, path, host, title, search, and referrerin the messagepropertiesandip and user-agentin the messagecontext.
Here’s an example of an express middleware function that covers all those edge cases:

Crawling: https://segment.com/docs/guides/how-to-guides/create-push-notification/
Paragraphs:
Like emails, push notifications are an extremely powerful way to re-engage customers on mobile apps. Push notifications are personal, so targeting them precisely using customer behavioral data (from Segment) is crucial.
For example,Waneloaccepts direct product feeds from retailers. For any of these retailers, when a product goes on sale, they can send a push notification to the people who have saved that product in their profile.
Push messaging focuses around three key features:
Content: Diversify your messaging just as you would with an investment portfolio. you want to target your consumers with right content and avoid opt out for push. For example, Netflix uses push notifications to let users know when their favorite shows are available. Rather than sending every user a notification every time any new show or season is released.
Frequency: Consider your App Store Category. News/Sports apps send push notifications daily or multiple times a day if it’s “game day”. So do Social Networking/Messaging apps. However, apps that are utilitarian, for example, food and drink, health and fitness, or productivity only message when necessary.
Timing: Always send push notifications to users in their local timezone. In general, mobile usage peaks between 6pm - 10pm.
Self evaluate when trying to choose a destination that suits your needs.
You will find many alternatives, but choosing the right one for your app is important!
Ask users to opt in to push notifications upon app install or after the first time they use an app, so it’s easier to be transparent about how users can opt out later.
Let your customers decide what notifications they want to receive. It may help to break up your notifications into categories so you can empower your customers with this decision.
Creating lists of your app users based on characteristics or events that align to specific campaigns will help you better target your mobile marketing efforts.
Make sure to use deep linking to guide users to the specific screen relevant to that offer.
Pay attention to user time zones and customize messages based on time of year (holidays) to make brand personable.
The ideal frequency depends on the type of app you have.
Test different action words, phrases, message lengths, and more.
To “auto-enroll” new users into existing campaigns.
Don’t silo the success of your campaign to just app opens.

Paragraphs:
On this page
The paths consumers take to your app or website are more complex than ever, often involving a variety of online communities and multiple devices. Your next repeat customer might stumble across your display ad on a newsletter you’ve never heard about, or receive a recommendation from a co-worker in a Slack channel.
But these off-domain and cross-device brand interactions are equally, if not more, important to track and understand. With this data, you can identify more sources of qualified traffic and determine the best shopping experiences for conversion.
In this guide, you’ll learn where and how to track these critical events so that you can understand your customer’s journey before they even get to your storefront, as well as their preferred shopping experiences.
If you’re interested in learning about what to track,check out Segment’s guide on creating an e-commerce tracking plan.
Talk to a product specialist todayabout building a clean, high-quality data spec so you can focus on brand engagement and sales growth.
Digital marketing consists of owned marketing, earned marketing, and paid marketing.
Ownedmarketing encompasses all activities you have full control over. It can be further split into first- and second-party data. First-party data is customer data generated on your site or in your app. Second-party data is customer data generated when your customers interact with your email or push notifications (for example, “Email Opened” or “Push Notification Received”).
Earnedmarketing is when publications, newsletters, or blogs organically create some content that refers to, or promotes you.
Paid acquisition, like display ads or embedded advertorials, don’t exist on your domain. To track the inbound traffic from both “earned” and paid acquisition sources, Segment uses UTM parameters (and deep links if you’re directing a customer to a specific screen in your mobile app that has the product to purchase).
Track engagement on your email channels
While these are still under “owned” marketing, they happen off your domain. An example is sending an engagement email to your customer base with a call-to-action to visit your store. If you’re using Segment and an email or push notification tool on Segment’s platform, you can easily collect second-party data such as “Email Sent” and “Push Notification Opened”.
Learn more about whichemailandpush notification toolsSegment supports.
Here are some of the most commonly used and popular events tracked through email and push notifications on Segment:
Email Delivered
Email Opened
Push Notification Received
Push Notification Opened
Deep Link Clicked
If your email tool is not supported on Segment, you can still track email opens with Segment’s tracking pixel. This pixel functions like an advertising pixel in that it embeds an image onto pages where JavaScript and POST requests are disabled.
View a list of tools Segment supports.
In your email template HTML, include an image tag where thesrcis a URL that is carefully constructed to hit Segment’s appropriate endpoint with a JSON payload that is base64 encoded.
An example of the payload that will be sent to Segment upon an email open is:
Then, you would base64 encode that and append it to the Segment endpoint:
Add the complete URL as thesrcin the image tag.
Learn more about Segment’s Pixel API.
Track earned traffic with UTM Parameters
UTM parameters are types of query strings added to the end of a URL. When clicked, they let the domain owners track where incoming traffic is coming from and understand what aspects of their marketing campaigns are driving traffic.

UTM parameters are only used when linking to your site from outside of your domain. When a visitor arrives to your site using a link containing UTM parameters, Segment’s client-side analytics.js library will automatically parse the URL’s query strings, and store them within thecontextobject as outlined in theSpec: Commondocs. These parameters do not persist to subsequent calls unless you pass them explicitly.
UTM parameters contain three essential components:
utm_campaign: This is the name of your campaign. All marketing activities that support this campaign, needs to have the same utm_campaign so that downstream analysis to measure performance for this specific campaign can be done off this primary key. (Example: “national-toastday”)
utm_medium: How the traffic is coming to your site. Is it through email, a display ad, or an online forum? This ensures Segment’s downstream analysis can easily see which channel performs the best. (Examples: “email”, “paid-display”, “paid-social”, “organic-social”)
utm_source: Where the traffic is specifically coming from. You can be specific here. This ensures Segment’s downstream analysis can measure which specific source brings the most conversions. (Examples: “twitter”, “customer.io” (email tool), “facebook”, “adroll”)
With these being optional:
utm_content: For multiple calls to action on a single page, utm_content indicates which one. For example, on a website, there may be three different display ads. While the link on each display ad will have the same utm_campaign, utm_medium, and utm_source, the utm_content will be different. (Examples: “banner”, “left-side”, “bottom-side”)
utm_term: This is the parameter suggested for paid search to identify keywords for your ad. If you’re using Google Adwords and have enabled “autotagging”, then you don’t need to worry about this. Otherwise, you can manually pass the keywords from your search terms through this parameter so that you can see which keywords convert the most. Note that this parameter is reserved explicitly for search. (Examples: “toast”, “butter”, “jam”)
If you’d like UTM parameters to persist in subsequent calls, you’ll need to manually add those fields in thecontext.campaignobject of your event call. For example:
You can also store the values in cookies and/or localStorage and useAnalytics.js Middlewareto enrich the payload for subsequent calls.
Learn more about the semantics with each UTM parameter.The key isn’t to stick with the definitions that closely, but to be consistent within your own analytics system.
Proper UTMs use
A marketing campaign is a single marketing message across several platforms, media, and channels, with a consistent and clear call-to-action.
Since the marketing campaign is from off-domain to your storefront (on your property or domain), then it’s critical to use the proper and consistent UTM params across all of your channels:
Emails
Paid acquisition
Guest blog post in partner’s newsletter
Article in the news
Offline events / in real life / meat space
Your UTM parameters would match a pattern such as:
Having the same utm_campaign across all channels
Different utm_source and utm_medium depending on the channel
If you were on paid acquisition, the placement of the display ad would determine what goes in utm_content
If you were using paid search, the term would be utm_term
An example would be a National Toast Day campaign. This campaign would include emails, paid acquisition (with AdRoll and Facebook Ads), organic social (Twitter), and promotional content on partners’ blogs.
Having the consistent UTM parameters naming convention simplifies the downstream analysis and the ease of querying across dimensions, such as within the campaign, which medium or source was the best. Or which placement of the display ad led to the most conversions.
Learn more about measuring ROI of marketing campaigns with SQL and UTM parameters.
It’s common for customers to discover you on their desktop before making the purchase much later on their phone. How do you tie all of these events back to the same customer so you can understand which marketing activities on what screens are responsible for conversions?
Track server-side when possible
Tracking with JavaScript in the browser has its benefits, such as using browser technologies to automatically track things like UTM parameters, referring domain, IP address, and user agent. But here are a few reasons why it might make sense for your store to track on the server side.
Are your customers technically savvy and use ad blockers? Ad blockers restrict requests from a list of blocklisted domains to your browser, which means that none of your event tracking will work properly. If you sell to a technical audience, it is possible that you may be underreporting your analytics by a material amount.
Do you have multiple devices? If you have multiple devices with the same customer check out flow, moving those events to the server-side will reduce your surface area of your code base. This means less maintenance and faster changes.
Learn more about client vs server tracking.
If you do move key checkout events to the server side, you will have to manually send the data automatically collected by Segment’s client-side JavaScript library to your server. These pieces of tracking data are still important for the following reasons:
UTM parameters: Collecting the UTM params will allow you to tie conversion events to your marketing campaign or activities. This is valuable in that you can immediately measure performance and calculate ROI on your campaigns.
IP address: The IP address can provide location intelligence for your customers. This means you can personalize your shopping experience or engagement emails with inventory that might be more relevant depending on your customers’ locations.
User Agent: The User Agent will inform you of your customers’ preferred device and shopping experience. Are they converting on a mobile web browser? Native app? Or on their laptop?
Learn how to usecontextto manually send this information on the server side.
Track the same user across devices
If your store allows user registration and users are logged in when they shop on your site or app, then you can track them across devices.
This works by using auserIdinstead of ananonymousIdto track key events and where they occur. ThisuserIdserves as the primary key in your downstream tools and data warehouse, allowing you to join all of a profile’s anonymous activities with logged in activities. You also can get a complete picture of a profiles location, and what device they are on while using your app or website.
Learn more about pulling the entire user journey for a single user given a userId.
Unfortunately, tracking the same user across devices only works if they log in to each device. Anonymous browsing in each distinct “experience” (for example, mobile safari, native iPhone, browser on laptop) generates its own uniqueanonymousId. EachanonymousIdis limited to the scope of that browser or app, only measuring activities in those sessions. It’s not until the user logs in when theuserIdis generated (if registering for a new account) or theuserIdis retrieved from your database, and then mapped to theanonymousIdof that session. Segment keeps a table ofanonymousIds mapped to a singleuserIdso you can analyze a user’s activity across multiple devices.
If a user logs in on multiple devices, then you would be able to analyze even the anonymous activity across those devices. Consequently, it’s important to encourage your users to log in so that you have this capability.
One of the biggest challenges for brick-and-mortar stores is to measure the impact of their online advertising campaigns on their in-store purchases. Attributing offline conversions has traditionally been difficult to achieve, due to the lack of offline data and robust infrastructure to route that data.
For Facebook advertisers,Facebook Offline Conversionsallow you to tie offline conversions to your campaigns. It’s important to note that the offline data is labeled to an event set that has been assigned to a Facebook campaign. Here are the two ways to attribute offline conversions to Facebook advertisements:
Uploading offline event data about actions that aren’t captured with Facebook Pixel or App Events to Facebook for them to match actions to your Facebook ads

Most other advertising networks provide some functionality of manually uploading offline data to match with their online advertising data. Here is a short list of other services:
Attributing in-store purchases to an impression from a display ad online is critical to help marketers and advertisers understand which campaigns or creatives are driving sales. The more real-time the data and insights, the more nimble your business can be in altering course so that additional resources can be put towards the right marketing actions.
The internet has made it easy for customers to come from nearly anywhere to your digital storefront. But there are ways to track and collect data to better understand these complicated paths so you can be intentional with your marketing efforts to tap into these communities.
By tracking in these locations with the above mentioned techniques, your downstream analysis will also be simpler. With UTM params, you’ll be able to quickly measure the performance of a campaign or a particular channel. By properly tracking on multiple devices, you can understand which shopping experiences are most preferred. These tracking techniques are invaluable to understanding the source of your highest quality customers.

One component of building a successful and engaging e-commerce brand is rewarding your most loyal customers. With Segment Warehouses and SQL, you can retrieve a table of your most valuable customers, then reward them.
This guide will walk you through setting up a dynamic and automated coupon program based on conditions that define your most valuable customers, as well as how to measure the program’s performance.
Talk to a product specialist todayabout using data to tailor your brand experience.
Emails withCustomer.io: Customer.io is a flexible email provider that allows you to create cohorts based on customer actions. You can build complex onboarding emails, nurture email campaigns, as well as marketing automation workflows.
Retention Analytics withAmplitude: Amplitude is an analytics tool that focuses on understanding retention and funnel analysis.
It’s important to register for these tools and enable them on your Segment source project. When Segment collects tracking data, it routes it to all of your enabled tools, meaning that they get a single consistent data set. Most importantly, the data generated by users interacting with emails is sent through Segment so you can analyze email performance, and how it impacts conversion with Amplitude.
Not using Customer.io or Amplitude?Check out the other Segment SupportedEmail MarketingandAnalytics tools.
Say, as the marketing manager of our fictitious, on-demand artisanal toast company, Toastmates, you want to experiment with a coupon program to retain your best customers.
Through a combination of SQL and statistical analysis on a set of historical data, you’ve identified the conditions for our most valuable customers as:
Learn how to define these conditions inHow to Forecast LTV for e-commerce with Excel and SQL.
Will rewarding a $5 coupon to this cohort after they make the second purchase a month lead to higher engagement and LTV? Set up this program using Customer.io as the email provider and measure it’s performance on engagement and LTV with Amplitude.
Conduct a split test (half of the cohort will represent the control group and will not receive any emails; the other half will receive an email with the $5 coupon) for one month. After which, use Amplitude to see if there were any correlations between the coupon email and conversions.
First, register for an account with Customer.io and Amplitude. Then, enable Customer.io and enable Amplitude on your Segment project. Finally, go into your Customer.io account and enable “sending data to Segment”:

You can find those destination settings in Customer.io here.
When everything is enabled, customer event data such asOrder CompletedandProduct Added, as well as their properties, will all be sent to your configured destinations, including Customer.io and Amplitude. Then you can define cohorts based on these events in Customer.io to add to email campaigns or conduct funnel analytics in Amplitude.
Talk to a product specialist to learn what else you can accomplish with these tools.
Now define the specific cohort in Customer.io as per our conditions listed earlier: someone who spends over $20 per order and shops over twice a month. In Customer.io, go to “Segments” and “Create Segment”:

After this cohort is created, then when a customer makes the third purchase in a month and it’s over $20, they will be added to this segment.
Next, create a “segment trigger campaign”, where Customer.io will send a message the first time someone enters a segment. The segment in this case will be the one you just created: Coupon Loyalty Experiment.

Save the changes and enable the campaign. Then, make sure that your e-commerce backend is set up properly to handle the coupons. If it’s available in your system, create a coupon that only works for a specific set of customers.
After a month has passed for the split test, you can measure the performance of the email coupon program to see whether it’s making a material impact on conversions.
In Amplitude, create a funnel that compares the two cohorts—one who received this coupon email vs. the control group who did not—and see its impact on conversions and revenue generated.
First, define a behavioral cohort with the conditions of being loyal customers so you can use it when analyzing the conversion funnel:

You’ll also have to create a second identical cohort, except with the only difference that these customers did not receive the coupon email. You need this cohort to create the conversion funnel with the control group.

After you’ve created these two cohorts, create two funnel charts. The first funnel will look at the control group. The second funnel will look at the group that received the coupon email.

Resulting in:

The control group that did not receive the email for the coupon resulted in 233 people visiting the store, with 66 conversions.
The funnel for the group who did receive the emails can be created with these parameters:

Resulting in:

The email itself drove 168 customers to the store, which also saw higher conversions toProduct Addedand ultimatelyOrder Completed.
Note that this funnel is only looking customers who went through these events in this specific order. This analysis doesn’t consider customers who are part of the emailed cohort, yet didn’t open the email, but still visited the site and/or made a purchase.
At first glance, it appears that the group that was emailed did receive an absolute number of more conversions. However, these funnels are still inconclusive, given that you haven’t explored the impact on the top line revenue, as well as overall engagement with the brand. Fortunately, you can continue to use Amplitude to analyze impact on revenue itself.
Retaining and rewarding your customers is paramount to a strong and engaging brand. This example is just one of millions that you can employ to find new ways to delight and excite your customer base.
Other ideas can be to send messages to your customers with a referral code to invite their friends. Or set up a coupon for customers who are just shy of entering your most valuable customers cohort. Or, if you’re hosting a pop up shop event, sending a special and personalized invite to your strongest users first, as a way to thank them for their business.
The possibilities are endless when you use your customer data to drive sales.

Paragraphs:
On this page
Customer Lifetime Value (“LTV”) is the amount of money that an individual customer will spend with a given business in the future. It’s often used to value cohorts in your customer base, determine how much to spend in acquiring or retaining new users in a given cohort, rank customers, and measure the success of marketing activities from a baseline LTV forecast.
The LTV calculation is not straightforward for e-commerce businesses, since future payments are not contractual: at any moment, a customer may never make a single purchase again. Additionally, forecasting future purchases requires statistical modeling that many current LTV formulas lack.
This guide shows how to calculate forward-looking LTV for non-contractual businesses using SQL and Excel. This analytical approach allows you to accurately rank your highest value customers, as well as predict their future purchase sizes to help focus your marketing efforts.
This guide assumes you’re using the tracking schema described inHow to implement an e-commerce tracking planand are storing data in aSegment Warehouse.
Talk to a product specialistto learn how companies like Warby Parker and Crate & Barrel use a data warehouse to increase engagement and sales.
In a non-contractual setting, you can’t use a simple retention rate to determine when customers terminate their relationship. This is because the retention rate is a linear model that doesn’t accurately predict whether a customer has ended her relationship with the company or is merely in the midst of a long hiatus between transactions.
The most accurate non-contractual LTV model, named “Buy Til You Die” (“BTYD”), focuses on calculating the discounted estimation of future purchases based on recency of last purchase, frequency of purchases, and average purchase value. This model uses non-linear modeling to predict whether or not a user is “alive” or “dead” given historic transactions to forecast future probability and size of purchases.
Since LTV is a critical metric for e-commerce companies, it’s important that this model, instead of simpler linear formula that is based on retention rates, is used for it’s calculation.
Use SQL to build the necessary table, which will be exported as a CSV and opened in Google Sheets. Then, use Solver to estimate the predictive model parameters, which ultimately calculates the future purchases of each customer. Finally, the LTV calculation is simply the net present value of each customer’s future purchases. Rank them by LTV, then find behavioral patterns across the top 10 or 50 customers to figure out how best to target or retain this cohort.
Recency, frequency, and average size
As a growth analyst at the fictitious on-demand artisanal toast company, Toastmates, it’s important to know which customers are worth more to the business than others. Most important, you should understand what similarities these customers all have to help guide the marketing team in their efforts.
The first step in creating the BTYD model is to get historic purchasing data of at least a month. In your analysis, you can use data from the past six months. The data must include the columnsuserId(email is fine too), number of purchases within the specified time window, days since last purchase, and days since first purchase.
Then, usethis Google Sheet, which provides all of the complex calculations for estimating the model parameters, as well as forecasting the future sales of each customer. This sheet is View Only, so be sure to copy it entirely so you can use it.
To retrieve a table with the right columns for analysis, use the follow SQL query:
This returns a table where each row is a unique user and the columns are email, number of purchases within the time window, number of discrete time units since last purchase, and average purchase order.

Here is a screenshot of the first twelve rows returned from the query in Mode Analytics.
Export this data to a CSV, then copy and paste it in the first sheet of the Google Sheet where the blue type is in the below screenshot:

Also be sure to add the total time in days in cell B6. This is important as the second sheet uses this time duration for calculating net present value of future payments.
After you paste in the CSV from the table into the first tab of the sheet, the next step is to estimate the model parameters (the variables on the top left of the sheet). In order to do this, we need to use a feature of Microsoft Excel called Solver.
You can export your Google Sheet as an Excel document. Then, use Excel Solver to minimize the log-likelihood number in cell B5, while keeping the parameters from B1:B4 greater than 0.0001.

After Solver runs, cells B1:B4 will be updated to represent the model’s estimates. Now, you can hard code those back into the sheet on Google Sheets. The next sheet relies on these model estimates to calculate the expected purchases per customer.
The model requires four pieces of information about each customer’s past purchasing history: her “recency” (how many “time units” her last transaction occurred), “frequency” (how many transactions she made over the specified time period), the length of time over which we have observed her purchasing behavior, and the average transaction size.
In the example, you have the purchasing behavior data over the course of six months with each unit of time being a single day.
You can apply a both a beta-geometric and a negative binomial distribution (“BG/NBD”) to these inputs and then use Excel to estimate the model parameters (an alternative would be the Pareto/NBD model). These probability distributions are used because they accurately reflect the underlying assumptions of the aggregation of realistic individual buying behavior. (Learn more about these models).
After estimating the model parameters, you can predict a particular customer’s conditional expected transactions by applying the same historic purchasing data to Bayes’ Theorem, which describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions related to the event.
Estimating the model parameters
The top left part of the first sheet represent the parameters of the BG/NBD model that must be fitted to the historic data you paste in. These four parameters (r, alpha, a, and b) will have “starting values” of 1.0, since you’ll use Excel Solver to determine their actual values.
The values in columns F to J represent variables in the BG/NBD model. Column F, in particular, defines a single customer’s contribution to a the overarching function, on which we’ll use Solver to determine the parameters. In statistics, this function is called the likelihood function, which is a function of the parameters of a statistical model.
In this particular case, this function is the log-likelihood function, which is B5, as calculated as the sum of all cells in column F. Logarithmic functions are easier to work with, since they achieve its maximum value at the same points as the function itself. With Solver, find the maximum value of B5 given the parameters in B1:B4.
With the new parameter estimates, you can now predict a customer’s future purchases.
Predicting a customer’s future purchases
In the next sheet, you can apply Bayes’ Theorem to the historic purchasing information to forecast the quantity of transactions in the next period. Multiply the expected quantity with the average transaction size to calculate the expected revenue for that period, which you can extrapolate as an annuity, of which you can find the present discounted value (assuming discount rate is 10%).
Central to the Bayes’ Theorem formula is the Gaussian hypergeometric function, which is defined by “2F1” in column M. Evaluate the hypergeometric function as if it were a truncated series: by adding terms to the series until each term is small enough that it becomes trivial. In the spreadsheet, we sum the series to it’s 50th term.
The rest of the variables in Bayes’ Theorem is in columns I through L, which use the inputs from the customer’s historic purchasing information, as well as the model parameter estimates as determined from Solver (cells B1:B4).
The expected quantity of purchases in the next time period is calculated in column H.
Finally, multiply that with the average transaction size and you can get the expected revenue for the next time period.
This exercise allows you to rank your customers from most valuable to least by ordering column F in descending order. You can take theuserIds of the top several customers and look across their shopping experiences to identify any patterns that they share, to understand what behaviors are leading indicators to becoming high value customers.
Below is a simple query to get a table of a user’s actions in rows. Just replace theuser_idwith the user in question.
This above query for user whoseuser_idis"46X8VF96G6"returns the below table:

At Toastmates, most of the highest forward-looking expected LTV customers share one thing in common: averaging two orders per month with an average purchase size of $20.
With that in mind, you can define a behavioral cohort in our email tool, Customer.io, as well as create a trigger workflow so we can send an email offer to these customers.
Learn how to use email tools to target this cohort of high value customers.
This exercise is useful not only as a forward looking forecasting model for customer LTV, but also as a quality ranking system to see which customers are worth more to your business. Coupled with the ability to glance across the entire shopping experience of a given customer, you can identify broad patterns or specific actions that may be an early signal for a high value shopper. Recognizing these high value shoppers means being proactive in nurturing, rewarding, and retaining them.
And this is just the beginning. Having a rich set of raw customer data allows you to create accurate projection models for LTV so you know not only how much you can spend to acquire them, but also how to rank your customers by value. Ultimately, these insights lead to the right actions that can build an engaging shopping experience and drive sales.

Crawling: https://segment.com/docs/guides/how-to-guides/import-historical-data/
Paragraphs:
On this page
When transitioning over to Segment, customers commonly want to import historical data into tools they are migrating to or evaluating.
Note:Historical imports can only be done into destinations that can accept historical timestamped data. Most analytics tools like Mixpanel, Amplitude, or Kissmetrics can handle that type of data just fine. One common destination that doesn’t accept historical data is Google Analytics, since their API cannot accept historical data.
Use anyserver-side library, which sends requests in batches to improve performance. Once you have data to import, follow the steps below:
Export or collect the data to be imported.
Include timestamp data in your export if the data needs to appear in end tools in a historical reference. For instance, if you’re importing emails and it’s relevant to know when someone joined your email list, you may need to export the timestamp.If no timestamp is specified when importing, the data will show a timestamp from the time the data was received.
Decide which destinations need to receive the data.
By default, data coming into Segment will be forwarded to all destinations connected to a given source.To limit data to specific destinations, theintegrationsobject must be modified. With historical data, you often only want to send the data to a specific destination or into your data warehouse. For example, inNode.jsset theintegrationsobject as follows.
Once you’ve done that, you’ll need to write an application or worker to send the data to Segment.
You will need to cycle through each set of data and map it to a Segment server-side library method or build an array matching theHTTP Import API format.
Tip: Segment recommends using a Segment library for this process, as they set contextual message fields likemessage_id(used for deduping) andsent_at(used for correctly client clock skew) that Segment’s API uses to correct behavior upon ingestion.
Tip: The server-side libraries will automatically batch requests to optimize for performance and prevent linear request volume. This batching behavior is modifiable, and some of the underlying libraries implement a configurable max queue size that may discard messages if you enqueue requests much faster than the client can flush them. We recommend overriding the max queue size parameter for the library to a high value you’re comfortable you can remain under in your batch job.
The following projects are open-source and do not have official Segment support. If you encounter issues, the best way to get help is by opening an issue on the project’s GitHub page. 
Feel free to clone the repository and adjust the code to suit your unique needs.
One of Segment’s Success Engineers wrote an alpha prototype Node.js app for importing data utilizing the HTTP API, which we’ve included below:
Example Node.js import application
Additionally, one of Segment’s Software Engineers developed a React App with more out of the box functionality for importing events. The features include a modern UI, transformations, and event format checking prior to import:
Desktop React CSV uploader
MarketLyticshas documented their experience using the alpha prototype importer and offer somehelpful visuals and tips.
If a server-side library doesn’t meet your needs, you can use the Segmentbulk import HTTP APIdirectly.
Note:When you use the HTTP API to export historical data to upload to Segment, remove all the originalsent_at,message_id, andproject_idfields from the archived message before forwarding them back to Segment.

Paragraphs:

One of the first questions we get when our customers start querying all of their data is, how do I join all this data together? For example, let’s say you’d like to know if support interactions in Zendesk increase revenue in Stripe, or which percentage of users opened your email campaign and visited your website or mobile app? The key to answering these advanced questions is tying your data together across these sources. To do that, you need a common user identifier.
Each SaaS tool you use has its own way of identifying users with a unique primary key. And, you will find each of these different IDs across different collections of tables in your database. So, when you want to start matching Joe Smith who entered a ticket in Zendesk and also clicked through a campaign in Mailchimp, it starts to get tricky.

For example, Stripe keeps track of users with acustomer_id, Segment requires auser_id, and Marketo usesemailto uniquely identify each person.
To effectively join across these sources, you need to understand how each id maps to each other. The best way to do this is to create a common identifier across tools.
When you install a new tool (or useSegmentto install all of them at once), you need to choose what you will put in the ID field. There are lots of different options for this: emails, twitter handles, usernames, and more.
However, we suggest using the same ID you generate from your production database when you create a new user. Database IDs never change, so they are more reliable than emails and usernames that users can switch at their leisure. If you use this same database ID across as many tools as possible, it will be easier to join identities down the road. (In MongoDB, it would look something like this507f191e810c19729de860ea.)
Though we wish you could use a database ID for everything, some tools force you to identify users with an email. Therefore, you should make sure to send email along to all of your other tools, so you can join on that trait as a fallback.
Integrating as many tools as possible through Segment will make your joins down the road a little easier. When you use Segment toidentifyusers, we’ll send the same ID and traits out to all the destinations you turn on in our interface. (More aboutSegment destinations.
A few of our destination partners accept an external ID, where they will insert the same Segment user ID. Then you can join tables in one swoop. For example, Zendesk saves the Segment User ID asexternal_id, making a Segment-Zendesk join look like this:
Here’s a look at the Segment destinations that store the Segment User ID:
Whether you’re using Segment or not, we suggest creating a master user identities table that maps IDs for each of your sources.
This table will cut down on the number of joins you have to do because some IDs may only exist in one out of many tables related to a source.
Here’s sample query to create a master user identities table:
You’ll spit out a user table that looks something like this:
While creating this table in SQL is a good strategy, we’d be remiss not to point out a few drawbacks to this approach. First, you need to run this nightly or at some regular interval. And, if you have a large user base, it might take a while to run. That said, it’s probably still worth it.
How to run a query with your joined data
So what can you do once you have all of your ID’s mapped? Answer some pretty nifty questions that is. Here are just a few SQL examples addressing questions that incorporate more than one source of customer data.
Segment + Zendesk
Stripe + Zendesk
An alternative to the lookup user table in SQL would be writing a script to grab user IDs across your third-party tools and dump them into your database.
You’d have to ping the APIs of each tool with something like an email, and ask them to return the key or id for the corresponding user in their tool.
A sample script, to run on a nightly cron job, would look something like this:
Here is the documentation for Zendesk’s API for more information.

Paragraphs:
On this page
It’s surprisingly hard to answer questions about the ROI of your ad campaigns. What does a click actually result in? How much should I pay for it? We built our Sources for Facebook Ads and Google Adwords to help you understand the true performance and cost of your campaigns.
In this article, we dig into the nuances of data collection and potential gotchas around measuring clicks, pageviews, and ultimately, conversions.
Today, most marketing teams think about their paid acquisition funnel as three major steps…

This makes sense when looking at overall campaign performance, but hides several crucial funnel steps that can make the difference between increasing a campaign’s spend and shutting it off due to poor results.
Because page optimization and ad blockers can impact measurement of your funnel, it’s important to look at the four additional steps happening between the ad click and conversions.

Let’s go through each true funnel step in a little more detail.
Impressions & Clicks:When a user views an ad, the ad platform increments the count of impressions for that ad. When an ad is clicked, the ad platform logs a click. This is all handled by the ad platform’s servers. Facebook and Google work hard to filter invalid and fraudulent traffic, whether that’s a mistaken click, a bot, or a competitor looking to drain your advertising budget. Any bad traffic is removed from both your reporting and your monthly bill.
Page Request Initiated:After an ad is clicked, a user’s browser attempts to load your landing page. This request is the first contact your application has with the user, and the server responds with the content to render the landing page.
First JavaScript Loaded:The user’s browser starts to download the landing page content, which includes the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The browser parses and renders this content, loading the JavaScript sequentially as it parses the page. By default, analytics.js uses theasynctag, which means that the browser won’t block the page and will load analytics.js once everything else is ready. Analytics.js wants to get out of the way where possible so you can create the best experience for your customers.
Page Fully Rendered:The page is fully rendered once all the html, css and scripts have been loaded on the page. This time can vary a lot based on the speed of the internet connection (how fast all the assets download) and the device itself (how fast the local computer can run all of the scripts).
Third-Party Scripts Loaded:Finally, third-party scripts are asynchronously loaded onto the page. The speed at which these scripts are loaded depends on a variety of factors, like the page size, network speed, and the size and number of the third-party scripts. Once these scripts are loaded, analytics.js triggers apagecall to our API.
Conversion Event:From there, a user might fill out a form, signup, or buy your product!
There are three less-obvious contributors to fall-off across the paid acquisition funnel: slow loads, ad blockers, and bounces.
For the sake of illustration, this means that if you have 100 ad clicks, you will be able to count most but not all corresponding page views because some visitors may bounce (exit or hit the back button) before analytics.js is executed. Similarly, you may miss some attributable conversions due to slow load times (your page calls can’t fire in time) and ad blockers (which often block analytics not just ads).

Here’s how it works.
Slow Loads
Slow loads can impact your attribution modeling, making campaigns appear to have worse performance than reality. In the general case, when a user hits your landing page, your tracking code loads and triggers a pageview event that you can use to attribute that user to a campaign.
But if third-party scripts take on the order of seconds to load (for example, on 1x or 3G networks), users may click off the page before your tracking code executes. In this case, the pageview never gets recorded and your ability to attribute that click to a conversion is lost.
This is generally not an issue for most companies because they are focused more on people who spend a good deal of time on their pages. However, it is a potential source of opaqueness, particularly for users with slow or bad network connection.
Bounces
Bounces can occur at any stage of the funnel between an ad being clicked and third-party scripts loading on the page.
Some bounces are not tracked because the user doesn’t even last the few seconds to request your HTML, render it, and execute tracking. If they quickly hit back or close the browser window, your ad platform will report clicks that don’t show up in your analytics tracking.
Ad blockers
It is likely the case that some percentage of your users are using ad blockers. It’s estimated that22% of mobile smartphones worldwideand16% of US web trafficuse ad blockers. Segment customers have reported ad blockers for as little as a few percentage points of their visitors, to upwards of 70% of traffic for companies with very tech-forward audiences.
But just because a user is using ad blockers doesn’t mean that they aren’t seeing and clicking on ads. Facebook recently announced that they would besuppressing ad blockers, and Adblock Plus, the most popular ad blocking and anti-tracking software, categorizes Google Search ads asacceptable ads.
That said, many ad blockers do block analytics tools like Google Analytics, Mixpanel and Segment. This means that there exists some percentage of your conversions that actually came through your paid acquisition channels, but are unattributable due to ad blockers.
Segment offers two ways of joining your user clickstream data to your paid acquisition channels: standard client-side tracking or advanced server-side page calls.

Both options come with their own tradeoffs that are important to consider for your use case.
Client-side Tracking (Standard)
Analytics.js is loaded with the async tag by default, which means that the library and all it’s destinations are loaded near the end of the page rendering. The benefit is that analytics.js doesn’t slow down page loads, but it does mean that tracking is not executed immediately on page load.
When you use standard client-side tracking, you’ll lose pageview data for visitors who bounce or click off the page before analytics.js executes, and for visitors with ad blockers enabled.
Server-side Page Calls (Advanced)
If you want to capture adblock, bounce, and slow load traffic, we recommend adding an additionalpage()call to the server-side. This allows you avoid the browser altogether and see the total number of requests emanating from your paid acquisition channels. You’ll get visibility on an extra step in that funnel.
The general approach is to use an arbitraryanonymousId(e.g. a UUID) in the server-sidepage()call and then also set theanonymousIdas theajs_anonymous_idcookie in the browser. You can read more about how to implement that here. This approach is tricky to implement, so we recommend that this is undertaken only for use cases in which bounce and/or adblock data is critical.
If you want to get a quick estimate for the number of additional clicks you’d track using server-side tracking, you can use “redirect tracking” with a URL shortener to estimate the number of clicks coming from Google Adwords or Facebook Ads. This will give you an estimate for the number of times an ad is clicked (minus some bounce in the few hundred milliseconds of the redirect), which will closely match server-sidepage()tracking should you choose to implement it.

Here’s how it works…
Use a URL shortener like bit.ly to link to a landing page, with a custom parameter like?ttg=2.
Add the shortened link to your ad.
Measure total clicks from the bit.ly stats page.
In your warehouse, count the number of pages with that unique url parameter from step 1 (make sure you’re looking at the same timeframe).
We hope this overview helps explain the technical nuances of measuring what happens when a customer finds you using an ad! If you have any other questions, feel free to share them in the Segment Community for discussion.

The purpose of marketing campaigns is to drive traffic (and sales). But how do you know which campaigns yield the most conversions or what channel across the campaigns was most effective?
This guide provides you with the tools to answer these questions with SQL so that your marketing team can reproduce the hit campaigns and consistently generate loyal customers.
Talk to a product specialistto learn how companies like Warby Parker and Crate & Barrel use a data warehouse to increase engagement and sales.
The goal of marketing campaigns is to drive engagement and conversions. Most commonly performed by attracting traffic to the site, these campaigns use UTM parameters for attribution. In our analysis, we’ll be heavily relying on UTM parameters to analyze not only campaign, but also channel performance.
Learn how to effectively use UTM parameters in your marketing campaign strategies.
For our analysis walkthrough, we’ll use fictitious e-commerce and marketing data from on-demand artisanal toast company, Toastmates.
Toastmates is currently running these two campaigns:
Each of these campaigns used a combination of channels. Here is a table with the channels and corresponding UTM parameters so when we build the SQL query, we can make sure all of the traffic sources are accounted for.

We’ll use SQL below to measure the performance of each campaign and what that means for future marketing activities.
The following query creates a table where each row is a customer and the columns are the date time when a key funnel event happens that have thecontext_campaign_nameto match that of theUTM_campaign. The key funnel events in this analysis areStore Visited(based on a page view to the store URL),Product Viewed, andOrder Completed. Given that each channel may have some key top of the funnel action that is unique to itself, let’s save that analysis for when we’re analyzing across channels.
Feel free to copy and paste the below query for your analysis so long as you replacenational-toast-daywith your own UTM campaign parameter.
Here are the first four rows of the resulting table:

Then, we can use tweak the query above into the one below to perform some simpleCOUNTandSUMon the previous table to get conversion metrics as well as total revenue derived from the campaign.
Here is the resulting table:

This analysis not only gives us a great snapshot of the conversion points along each campaign’s funnel, but also shows that we’ve generated $3,100.37 from the National Toast Day campaign and $3,824.68 from the Toast Your Friend campaign. Also we can see that the quality of the traffic from the National Toast Day is higher, but we’ve had more total traffic from Toast Your Friend, which makes sense since it’s an ongoing campaign.
But this is not yet ROI, since we haven’t incorporated the spend—the labor of your marketing team and the paid acquisition channels to source part of this traffic—that went into these channels.
Add campaign costs
The main costs that are incorporated in an ROI calculation are salaries (pro-rated by person-hour) and media spend. While we could conceivably create a custom, static table in SQL that contains the spend information over time, the faster and more practical way would be a back of the envelope calculation.
The costs associated with a given campaign consist of two major pieces: the person-hour cost and any associated media spend.
Calculating the pro-rated person-hour is an estimate of the number of hours and people used to set up and manage the campaign, then multiplied by the hourly rates based off their annual salaries.
The media spend is the advertising cost for distributing creatives to generate traffic to your store
Want to easily export advertising data fromGoogle AdwordsorFacebook Ads?Check outSegment Sources.
When we have the aggregate cost numbers, the formula for ROI is:
Here is a spreadsheet to illustrate the ROI calculation for both campaigns:

Though ROI numbers are one success metric, it’s an important benchmark for comparing performance when launching new campaigns or comparing against past campaigns.
But how can we go one step further and see what worked and what didn’t? One approach is to see which channels convert better, so you know how to adjust your marketing spend or media buys in your current campaigns or future ones.
A single campaign can include a wide variety of channels: email, display ads, push notifications, forums, etc. all of which yields different engagement and conversion rates. Effective marketers will keep a pulse on each channel throughout the duration of the campaign to understand whether a target audience is being saturated, a creative refresh is needed (for advertising), or how to efficiently allocate future spend towards a source that converts.
The analysis is similar to measuring the performance across a single campaign, with the only change being finding events where we focus oncontext_campaign_mediumorcontext_campaign_sourceinstead ofcontext_campaign_name. The SQL below measures the conversion rates at key funnel events fornational-toast-day, but broken down byutm_medium.
You can copy the below into your favorite editor, as long as you change out thecontext_campaign_nameandcontext_campaign_mediumparameters to ones that applies to your business.
The resulting table:

Since the National Toast Day campaign is relatively new, the majority of the traffic is from the email and an article (“news”). But we can see that the social channels have a lower conversion from store visits to product views. Email has the best overall conversion to revenue, which may be attributed to the recipients already familiar with the Toastmates brand or having previously had a stellar end-to-end shopping experience.
We can further breakdown this analysis by seeing which email, display ads, and social channels performed the best, by addingutm_sourceandutm_content,assuming that you’ve properly added them in your earned and paid media links. Also note that this preliminary analysis in SQL doesn’t account for double-counted users, who had impressions with our brand on multiple channels (e.g. someone seeing a display ad, yet converted on the email outreach). Fortunately, there are multi-touch attribution models that can be applied to better understand the weights of each activity towards conversion.
Learn more about multi-touch attribution models.
Measuring the ROI and performance of marketing campaigns and marketing channels tells a compelling story about what types of campaigns resonate with your audience. How does your audience like to be engaged? Text, push notifications, email? What campaign messaging hooks work the best in getting them back at your store?
You can apply this analytical approach and performance measurement techniques to a wide variety of marketing activities, such as offline marketing, billboards, or sponsoring events. These insights can empower your team to focus on what works and eliminate what doesn’t.

Paragraphs:
On this page
Switching from your current client-side JavaScript event tracking to Segment is easy. Below you can find migration guides for the following tools:
If you’d like us to add more tools or mobile/server-side examples to this guidelet us know!
Google Analytics Custom Events are simple to record in Segment. You’ll record them with our track method and use the same properties you would when sending to Google Analytics directly.
The only mapping exception is the Event Action. That will automatically be populated by the Event Name you include in the track call.
Here’s an example:
Becomes:
Since Event Category is required we’ll populate it withAllif you don’t specify one. You can read more about this inour Google Analytics docs.
Segment has full support for the Google Analytics E-Commere API and theEnhanced E-Commerce APIas well. Make sure you followour e-commerce tracking planto make sure you’ll be able to use all e-commerce features in the tools we support.
For an e-commerce transaction to appear in Google Analytics you’ll need to enable e-commerce for your Google Analytics view and send an Order Completed event to Segment. This simplifies things a lot compared to the direct Google Analytics code.
Here’s an example:
Becomes:
At the very minimum you must include an orderId for each Order and for each product inside that order you must include an id and name. All other properties are optional.
Through Segment you can record user-scope custom dimensions using our identify, page, or track methods.
A full explanation can be found inour Google Analytics docspage, but here’s a quick example:
Becomes:
(This example assumes you have already mapped Gender to the correct dimension in your Segment source settings for Google Analytics.)
To see a full list of Google Analytics features and how they work through Segment readour Google Analytics docs page.
Event tracking is Mixpanel’s bread and butter. Below are all the relevant Mixpanel functions and how you can map them to Segment functions.
Switching your event tracking from Mixpanel to Segment couldn’t be easier. Our trackmethod maps directly to Mixpanel’s. The event name is the first argument and the event properties are the second argument.
Becomes:
The identify method in Mixpanel is used to merge together events from multiple environments so your unique events number is accurate and your funnels don’t break.
Sincemixpanel.identifyonly takes a single argument (a userID) it maps directly to our identify method:
Becomes:
Mixpanel has the idea of Super Properties, which are user traits that get attached to every event that the user does. In Segment you can set Mixpanel Super Properties using our identify method. Super properties are only supported in client-side librariesAnalytics.js,iOS,Android.
Here’s an example:
Becomes:
This also works when you include a userId argument in your identify call.
Alias is necessary in Mixpanel to tie together an anonymous visitor with an identified one. The Mixpanel and Segment alias methods both work the same.
In client-side javascript passing a single argument will alias the current anonymous or identified visitor distinct_id to the userId you pass into it:
Becomes:
If you are tracking links with Mixpanel’strack_linkshelper you can switch that code to the SegmenttrackLink helper functioninAnalytics.js.
And here’s an example:
Becomes:
If you are tracking forms withMixpanel’s track_forms helperyou can switch that code tothe Segment trackForm helper functionin Analytics.js.
And here’s an example:
Becomes:
Mixpanel people tracking is a separate database from the event tracking outlined above. For that reason there are separate API methods to record data to Mixpanel People.
This method sets people properties in Mixpanel People. In Segment you will use ouridentify method to accomplish this.
Here’s an example:
Becomes:
This also works when you include a userId argument in your identify call.
As you can see Segment also recognizes special traits like email and name and translates them to the keys that Mixpanel expects (we automatically add the dollar sign).
For more information check outour Mixpanel docs.
To use Mixpanel increment through Segment you won’t event need anything in your code! All you have to do is list the events you’d like to increment automatically in your Mixpanel destination settings.
Read more inour Mixpanel Increment Docs.
Mixpanel’s Revenue report requires the use of a special function calledtrack_charge. In Segment that special function becomes a simple track call. By using the event nameOrder Completedwe’ll also use that event for any tools you use that recognize ourecommerce spec.

Crawling: https://segment.com/docs/guides/how-to-guides/segment-and-attribution/
Paragraphs:
On this page
At a higher level, attribution tools allow you to connect a specific campaign to user acquisition, giving you more visibility into campaign performance.  Seethe destination catalogfor a list of attribution tools that Segment supports.
There are three stages of mobile attribution as it relates to Segment.
Customer installs your app
The install is attributed by an attribution provider (Adjust, AppsFlyer, etc)
Attribution information is sent back to Segment
Here is a bit more information on what is happening at each of those stages.
Whenlifecycle eventsare enabled, theApplication InstalledandApplication Openedevents are triggered on the first app open after the app is installed.  Note, if the app is deleted and then later reinstalled on the device, these events will be triggered again on first app open.
Situations where install counts look lower in Segment than in other tools.
Some tools, like iTunes or Google Play, count install on download rather than on app open like Segment.  iTunes and Google Play is able to easily collect data on download but not as easily able to collect first-party data on app open. Whereas other tools, such as Segment, need their SDK to be loaded in app and initialized on app open before they are able to collect the install information. For example, if a user downloads your app but does not open it, the install will be counted in iTunes/Google Play but not counted in Segment or other tools.
Situations where install counts look higher in Segment than in other tools
Many tools deduplicate install data. Some tools only allow one install event per lifetime of deviceId. Others deduplicate by deviceId accepting only one install per UTC day.  Each and every tool is different.
Segment, on the other hand, does not deduplicate.  We don’t believe our role in your data pipeline should be deduping particular events.  In fact, there may be situations where you may want to account for multipleApplication Installedevents such as: user sells their phone, user uninstalls and later decides to reinstall, etc. It is better to think about theApplication Installeddata in your Segment warehouse as the raw source of data, giving you flexibility to query
For more information on how installs are counted in different tools, here are a few resources from our partners:
Adjust - Discrepancies and Why Data Does not Always Match Up
When you enable an attribution destination in device-mode, our integration code will also load that tool’s SDK. Upon app launch, the destination’s SDK will send install information which is then use to attribute that install to a campaign on their backend.  Segment loads the destination’s SDK, but attribution happens outside of Segment.
Destination receives theApplication Installedevent and attributes the installation on their backend.
For tools that support this, if you have enabled “Track Attribution Data” in your Segment dashboard, our integration listens to the attribution tool’s SDK for a change in attribution state.Note: Not all device-mode attribution tools offer “Track Attribution Data” functionality.  See the settings section for a particular tool in your Segment dashboard for confirmation.
When there is a change in attribution state, the integration code triggers anInstall Attributedcall to be sent back to your Segment source (and on to all other enabled destinations - in device and cloud-mode).
Here is an example of how that call is triggered in theAppsFlyer integration code. This is the similar for other attribution providers such asAdjust.
For tools that support server-side postback, after install is attributed, anInstall Attributedevent is triggered and sent server-side to your Segment source and forwarded on to all enabled cloud-mode destinations.
ExampleInstall Attributedevent:
For more detailed information on a particular attribution destination and functionality, see ourDestinations docs.

Paragraphs:
On this page
Below you’ll find a bunch of ways to set up notifications for yourself based on the data you’re sending through Segment.
Connections Alerting allows Segment users to receive in-app, email, and Slack notifications related to the performance and throughput of an event-streaming connection.
Connections Alerting allows you to create two different alerts:
For more information about Connections Alerting, see theConnections Alertingdocumentation.
You can use Google Analytics Custom Alerts to send yourself emails whenever a specific traffic segment drops below (or above) a threshold you set.
Learn how to set up email alerts inGoogle’s documentation.
With tools like Amplitude, Kissmetrics, and Mixpanel, you can set up email reports delivered to you on a daily basis. They are completely customizable, so you can keep an eye on as many events or other metrics you’d like.
Chartbeat and GoSquared both offer awesome real-time dashboards to see what’s happening right now on your site. They both include the option to get notified when your traffic hits a certain threshold. For example, if your on-site visitors is less than 100 people, or more than 1,000.
GoSquared also offers in-depth historical and user analysis. Chartbeat sticks to realtime anonymous traffic, but offers some sweet features for publishers.
The last option Segment recommends is to use a monitoring tool likePagerDutyorDatadogand point Segment’swebhooksdestination at them. That way you can set up custom alerts in their system.
The last option for alerting based off of Segment events is to use one of the email tools available on the Segment platform that offers event-triggered emails. Your options there are Customer.io, Vero, Autopilot, Outbound, Klaviyo, or Threads.

Paragraphs:
On this page
An account is associated to a single user and is attached to the email address you sign up with. A workspace houses all of your sources, and can have one or several user accounts as owners and/or read-only members.
You don’t need to do anything if you change your domain name. If the new domain name will serve as the same Segment source, make sure you use the same Segment write key that you used with the old domain.
You may claim ownership of your domain for the purposes of single sign-on login association, but it currently has no bearing on data collection.
Some of Segment’s previous plans, including the legacy API plan, limited integration usage. If you want to add an integration that’s not available on your current plan, move to a new Team plan. Team plans include all integrations, along with other additional features.
No. Deleting your account only stops you from accessing workspaces through your login. The workspace is where the subscription is managed, and it will not be deleted. Data will still flow into Segment and your Destinations, and you will still be charged if you delete your account but don’t delete your workspace.
To delete your account, go to theUser Settingsmenu, and clickDelete Accountat the bottom of the page.
Once the account is deleted you will not have access to workspaces associated with your account that are attached to the email address you signed up with.
To delete your workspace, go to yourWorkspace Settings, click theGeneraltab, then clickDelete Workspace.
You should also change your write keys for each source and remove all Segment snippets from your codebase.
To update the email address associated with your Segment account:
You’ll need to authenticate and verify your new email address for the change to take effect. Note thatworkspace ownerscan’t make this change for other users.
Changing your workspace name or slug won’t impact any sources or destinations you’ve already configured. If you’re usingSegment’s Public API, you’ll need to change the slug in your request URLs.
We were unable to save your changes, please try again
If you see this error message when trying to change a workspace slug, it often means the slug is already taken.
No. Deleted sources and workspaces cannot be recovered.
Though workspaces can’t be merged, you can move an existing source to a single workspace to the same effect. For example, you might move existing sources to one workspace so that you can unify all of your data across teams and gain a broader view of your customer data tracking.
To move a source between workspaces, navigate to the source’sSettingstab, then clickTransfer to Workspace. Choose the workspace you’re moving the source to, then clickTransfer Source.
When you transfer a source from one workspace to another, Segment migrates all connected non-storage destinations.
The person who transfers the source must be aworkspace ownerfor both the origin and recipient workspaces, otherwise the recipient workspace won’t appear in the dropdown list.

Tracking Plans do not transfer
Segment recommends that you disconnect Tracking Plans from Sources before you initiate a workspace transfer. Once the transfer is complete, add and reconnect your Tracking Plans in the new workspace.
Sources can't be transferred to EU workspaces
Though transferring sources to the EU workspace is not blocked in the UI, the transfer will not work as expected. This feature is not supported for cross region migration. Segment recommends that you re-create the source in the new workspace.

On the Segment monthly Team plan, your billing cycle starts the day after your 14-day trial ends. You’re billed on this day for each month while you’re on this plan.
On the Segment annual Team plan, you’re billed at the end of your 14-day trial for the amount of an entire year of service including a specific number ofMTUs. Annual plan subscribers are billed for MTU overages at the end of each monthly cycle.
If you already have a Segment workspace, you can change which plan your workspace is on by navigating toSettings > Usage & Billing > Plans.
If you cancel or downgrade your plan during the 2-week trial period, you don’t incur any charges.
If you cancel your plan or downgrade to a free account before the end of your official billing period on the monthly Team plan, you’ll receive a final bill for the prorated amount for the $120 base + a charge for any MTUs you’ve used over the allotted 10,000 at the rates posted on thepricing page.
Segment doesn’t issue refunds for the pre-paid portion of your annual bill after your trial ends.
Be aware that if you notify Segment of wanting to cancel your annual plan, but continue to send data to Segment’s servers, you may incur overage charges in any given month. You should fully delete your workspace or cycle your write keys to stop all data flow into Segment to avoid future charges.
All Segment customers with a US business address may be subject to state and local sales taxes. The applicable tax law applies based on your business location address, which may be different from your billing address. Customers who purchase a taxable product or service, and are located in a jurisdiction where Segment currently charges sales tax, will see the calculated sales tax on their invoice.
Segment collects Value Added Tax (VAT) and Goods and Services Tax (GST) on the services sold to its international customers located in certain foreign jurisdictions.
For more information about sales tax, VAT, and GST, see theSegment VAT/GST FAQs.
If you believe your organization qualifies for a sales tax exemption (for example, because of a nonprofit or government status), you can contacttax@segment.comwith the appropriate form.
Tax might still be charged on your bill if either:
In most cases Segment doesn’t offer refunds, as noted in theTerms of Service.Contact supportif you feel that you’re in a unique situation.
Segment offers a2-week trial on the Team planto let you try the plan before you purchase it.
Segment also offers the Free plan, which includes up to 1,000 MTUs, at no cost to you.
Find out more about thedifferent plansand which one suits your needs best.
The Free plan includes up to 1,000 MTUs at no cost. If you exceed the 1,000 MTU limit once in a 6-month period, Segment locks your account but data is still able to flow through Segment. To unlock your account, you can choose from these options:
If you exceed the 1,000 MTU limit twice in a 6-month period, Segment locks your account and also stops sending and receiving data. You can unlock your account by following option 2 above to upgrade to theTeam plan2-week free trial.
What is the Team trial?
The Team trial is a 14-day free trial of Segment’sTeam plan, and it includes all the features associated with a Team plan, including unlimited sources, two warehouse syncs per day, 10 seats, and 10,000 MTUs (with the ability to track more MTUs as needed).
How do I get a two-week Team trial?
You automatically receive a 2-week trial when you sign up for a Team plan.
Do I have to be a “new” customer to receive the free Team trial?
The free trial is available to all customers who have never had a Team plan. This includes new customers as well as customers who have previously been on the Free plan.
Do you have to include your payment information when signing up for a Team trial?
If you’re upgrading from a Free Plan to a Team Plan, you’re required to add your payment information.
If you’re signing up for a new Team plan, you don’t have to add your payment information during sign up. If you would like to continue to use the Team plan after the 14-day trial, add your credit card information on the “Payment Information” page in your workspace before the trial ends.
What happens when the two-week trial ends?
If you added your payment information, your subscription automatically continues at the regular rate after the trial period expires. You candelete your workspaceordowngrade to a Free planany time during the trial to avoid charges.
To activate the free trial, add your payment information.

Paragraphs:
On this page

The graphic illustrates an example billing model with data flowing through Segment within a monthly period. Each event on the different touch points (for example, Sign-ups or Product Added) is calculated as one API call.
Segment detects that the user across two of the touch points is the same user based on their userID (userID 123) and deduplicates them, counting for oneMTU.
With Engage, this user falls into one audience, has one computed trait, and falls into one Journeys step, accounting for three compute credits total. Compute credits are not tied to an individual user, so multiple people could fall into these buckets, still accounting for a single compute credit for each trait/audience/journey step.
Finally, the example sends some user events to a destination function, which is charged according to function execution time.
MTU stands for “monthly tracked user”. (Keep reading to learnhow Segment counts MTUs.)
When you use Segment to collect your data, you use the Segment tracking methods (Track, Page, Screen, Identify, Group, and Alias) which collect the datain a structured way, and then send it toapi.segment.io. If you are using the Segment HTTP API, or sending batched data using a cloud-source, that data also goes through this Segment API endpoint.
Each data blob (with its properties or traits) goes through this endpoint, and is considered one “API call”.
Depending on your Segment account type, your plan might include a throughput limit. The throughput limit tells you how many API calls and objects Segment allows you per MTU.
For example, if your workspace’s throughput limit is set to 250, this means that you can send a combined total of 250 API calls and objects to Segment each month per MTU you’ve paid for in your plan. If you have a 10,000 MTU plan, this means you can send up to a total of 2.5 million API calls and objects each month.
These objects and API calls are not tied to a specific user, but are an aggregate number applied to your workspace. Most customers never hit this limit, and Business tier plans often have custom limits.
You can sometimes “batch” API calls to reduce send times, however batching doesn’t reduce your throughput usage. Batched calls are unpacked as they are received, and the objects and calls the batch contains are counted individually. While batching does not reduce your throughput, it does reduce the possibility of rate limit errors.
Segment counts the number ofuniqueuserIds, and then adds the number ofuniqueanonymousIds that were not associated with auserIdduring the billing period. Segment counts these IDs over all calls made from all sources in your workspace, over a billing month. Segment only counts each user once per month, even if they perform more than one action or are active across more than one source.
Imagine that you have both a website and a mobile app. Both the website and mobile app have pages that you can use without being logged in, and both send Identify calls when a userdoeslog in.
As a simple example, imagine that a user is already logged in on both the website and the mobile app. When the user’s activity generates events on the website, these events are sent using Analytics.js, and include the user’suserId. When they do things on the mobile app, these events are sent from a mobile source, and also include theuserId. When Segment counts the MTUs, all the events from the sameuserIdonly generate one MTU, regardless of the source it came from.
Now imagine a new user, who has never logged in. At first, they have twoanonymousIds, one for the mobile app and one for the website. However, if they log in during the course of the month, you now know who they are, and can attach theiranonymousIdto auserId.
If the user logs in onjustthe app, you would still see two MTUs: oneanonymousIdfor the website source, and oneanonymousIdwith an attacheduserIdfrom the mobile app source.
If the user logs in onboththe app and website, they would count as one MTU: two differentanonymousIds attached to oneuserId.
If you have questions about your data usage or how it relates to your bill, log into your Segment workspace, clickSettings > Usage and Billing > Usage.
The Usage page shows what plan the workspace is on, what data volume that plan includes, and how much data you have already used in the current billing period. If you have used more data volume than your plan includes, the page shows information about how much data is in overage.
Click the billing period dropdown at the top of the page to see a cumulative daily report of data volumes (by source) for the current billing period. The last five billing periods are also available, along with an overview of the last twelve months of data volumes.
Understanding the difference between events and objects helps you understand how MTUs are calculated.
An event is a data collection triggered in response to a user action: aTrack call(or aPage/Screencall if the action was to navigate to a new page). Events take place in a single moment in time, and include a name, timestamp, andproperties. When an event happens more than once, it creates a new Event record (with a new timestamp) rather than updating an existing one. For example, a user browsing a product catalog might generate several “Product Viewed” events, which might include the product name, price, and category.
This is in contrast to “Objects” which represent a single thing that persists over time and can be updated. Objects have “traits” (instead of properties) which record information about that object, and which can change over time. For example a “user” object could have a trait of “email” which doesn’t change often, but could also have acomputed traitlikelogged_in_last_7_daysthat changes betweentrueandfalsebased on how much they use your site.
Object Cloud Sourcesretrieve records from integration partners on a scheduled basis. Segment processes these records before writing them out to connectedStorage Destinations. Segment counts one object for each record retrieved from a Cloud Source. The number of objects ingested during a billing period has a direct impact onthroughput, which is calculated as(objects ingested + API calls received) / MTU allowance.
Depending on the capabilities of the partner’s API, Segment may need to retrieve all available records and then deduplicate them prior to writing them out to a connected storage destination. In such cases, all retrieved records are still counted as ingested objects, even if the same records are retrieved multiple times in a given billing period. If you experience overages due to high object throughput, contactfriends@segment.comto request a less frequent sync cadence.
If you useCloud sourcesto pull in data from your third party services (in addition to tracking your users with Segment library sources), the data from these cloud appscanincrease your MTU counts and object counts.
There are two types of cloud sources:object sources, andevent sources. Object sources bring in information about entities, such as a person or company, which can change and have their properties updated over time. Events happen once in time, so while their properties don’t change, they can also happen more than once over time. (Seeabovefor more on objects vs events.)
Object sourcesdo notincrease your MTU countbecause the data included doesn’t usually contain an ID. Object sources can only send to Warehouses, anddoaffect the total object count which is used to calculate yourthroughput. Some examples of object-sources areSalesforce,Zendesk, andStripe.
Event sourcescancreate new MTUsbecause each event coming from this source includes either auserIdor ananonymousIdassociated with the event. Some examples of event sources areVero,Drip, andYoubora.
Tip!You can check theCollectionssection of a cloud-source’s Segment documentation to see what type of data it sends. The Collections table lists each data type sent from the cloud source, and tells you if that data is an Object or an Event.
Protocols is a Business Tier feature. If you are on a Free or Team plan, this section does not apply to you.
Segment’s Protocols product allows you to selectivelyfilter and block your incoming datato prevent malformed data from reaching destinations including your data warehouses and other storage solutions.
Tracking plan blocking: Blocked events are blocked from sending to all Segment Destinations, including warehouses and streaming Destinations. They’re blocked from reaching the entire Segment data pipeline. When you block an Event using a Tracking Plan, it does not count towards your MTU limit.
Blocked events (sometimes called “violations”) only count toward your MTU limit if you enableblocked event forwardingin your Source settings. You might do this to monitor issues with your incoming data as you continue to develop your tracking.
If you enable violation forwarding, it generates one (1) additional MTU in your workspace, total. If you are on an API billing plan, you are charged for the increased API volume generated by the forwarded violations. Forwarded violations might also generate costs in downstream destinations and data warehouses connected to the violations source.
Engageis a Business Tier addon feature. If you are on a Free or Team plan this section does not apply to you (because you do not have this feature).
All Engage data are omitted from billing MTU and API throughput calculations, includingcomputed traits,SQL traits, andaudiences.
Replayis a Business Tier feature. If you are on a Free or Team plan, this section does not apply to you.
Replays only affect your MTU count if you are using aRepeaterdestination, which might send data that hasn’t yet been seen this month back through a source.
See theReverse ETL usage limitsto see how MTUs affect your Reverse ETL usage limits.
Different tools count users under different conditions, so comparing numbers between any two tools, or between Segment and a tool, rarely produces the same number. Each tool accepts slightly different incoming data, and they often reject or process the incoming data differently. Included are some example explanations of why you might see differing numbers below.
ContactSegment Product Supportif for more information about a specific tool, or if you’re concerned that differing numbers might be due an implementation error.
Google Analytics requires that you include aurlin any Page calls from a Segment server library. If you don’t include aurl, Google Analytics silently rejects the call, which can reduce the number of users you see in GA.
Segment does not pass data fromIdentify callsto Google because it is against Google’s terms of service to pass Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to the Google Analytics reporting interface. If you need to pass data from an Identify call, you can set up aCustom Dimension mappingto override this.
To pass theuserIdfrom yourIdentify callsto Google Analytics, go to the Google Analytics destination settings in the Segment web app, locate theAdvanced Google Analytics settings, and enableSend User-ID to GA.
By default, Segment doesn’t send standardPage callsorScreen callsto Amplitude, which might reduce the number of unique users Amplitude sees.
To send Page and Screen calls to Amplitude, go to the Amplitude destination settings in the Segment web app, and locate theAdvanced Optionstab.
Amplitude can only automatically link an anonymous user to their logged-inuserIdif the events or traits come from a device-mode source (such as Analytics.js or a mobile library). If you use a server library or the Segment HTTP API, Amplitude can’tautomaticallyconnect the anonymous user to their logged-in identity. To work around this so Amplitude can connect the anonymous and identified user, make your Identify call when the user logs in, and include both theanonymousIdfrom before the user logged inandtheuserIdthe user provided at log-in.
For Amplitude to associate both client-side and server-side activity with the same user, you must pass the samedeviceIdto Amplitude. Otherwise, Amplitude creates two users - one associated with the user’sdeviceIdand another user associated with the user’s SegmentanonymousId.
There are several reasons why you might see a sudden increase in MTUs. Most of them are due to traffic fluctuations, however, some changes you make in code might also increase your MTU count, usually because you are (unexpectedly) generating a newanonymousIdoruserIdfor a single user.
If you think an implementation problem is causing an increase in your MTU count,contact Segment Product Supportas soon as possible for help troubleshooting and resolving the issue.
MTU counts usually increase when the number users or visitors to parts of your site or application that use Segment tracking increase. Sometimes you’ll see a spike when you post a big press release, or marketing campaign that leads to an influx of visitors. Another potential cause of big increases is adding tracking to parts of your site or app that didn’t have tracking before.
Another possibility is an increase in the number of interactions with your users outside your app (emails, help desk, push notifications, etc) that you are importing using cloud sources. Tracking users you weren’t tracking before increases your MTU count unless you are able to pass auserIdso they can be resolved with existing users. If you’re already tracking those users elsewhere with Segment, they are not counted a second time.
Users who are very privacy-conscious might cause your tracking to generate more MTUs; however in most cases these users are a fraction of a percentage of total traffic.
Check to see if you changed how you callanalytics.reset(). This utility method clears the old user identity information, and generates a newanonymousIdeach time you call it. This creates a user that Segment cannot resolve with an existing user until they are further identified.
Segment’s analytics libraries include methods that allow you to overwrite both theuserId(usingidentify(xxx)) andanonymousId(usinganalytics.user().anonymousId(xxx)). Using these methods on a user whose tracking information already includes an ID can cause the user to be counted more than once.
If you find you need to use one of these overwrite methods, you should check to make sure that the field you are changing isnullfirst. If the field isnotnull, you probably don’t want to overwrite it and lose the user’s original tracked identity.
If the pages you track are on more than one domain (for example,mydomain.comandmydomain.net), the user generates a newanonymousIdfor each domain. However, if the domain is a subdomain (for examplemydomain.comandapp.mydomain.com), they can share a user cookie and so share identity data and count as only one MTU.
If the user goes from one page to another and the second page loads in an iFrame, the page in the iFrame generates its ownanonymousId.
Segment does not bill for SMS and Email sends from Engage Channels. For actual billed usage, refer to the Twilio and SendGrid accounts that you’ve linked to Engage.

On this page
Connections is Segment’s core product offering: you can collect event data from your mobile apps, websites, and servers with one API, then pull in contextual data from cloud apps like your CRM, payment systems, and internal databases to build a unified picture of your customers.
In Segment, you create a source (or more than one!) for each website or app you want to track. Wehighly recommendcreating a Source for each unique source of data (each site, app, or server), though this isn’t required.
Sources belong to a workspace, and the URL for a source looks something like this:https://segment.com/<my-workspace>/sources/<my-source-name>/
You can create new sources using the button in the workspace view. Each source you create has a write key, which is used to send data to that source. For example, to loadanalytics.js, the Segment JavaScript libraryon your page, the snippet on theQuickstart Guideincludes:
Learn more about sources from thesources overview page.
Destinations are business tools or apps that you can connect to the data flowing through Segment. Some of Segment’s most popular destinations are Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Kissmetrics, Customer.io, Intercom, and KeenIO.
All of these tools run on the same data: who are your customers and what are they doing? But each tool requires that you send that data in a slightly different format, which means that you’d have to write code to track all of this information, again and again, for each tool, on each page of your app or website.
Enter Segment. Do it once.
Segment eliminates this process by introducing an abstraction layer. You send your data to Segment, and Segment understands how to translate it so we can send it along to any destination. You enable destinations from the catalog in the Segment App, and user data immediately starts flowing into those tools. No extra code required!
Segment supports many categories of destinations, from advertising to marketing, email to customer support, CRM to user testing, and even data warehouses. You can view a complete list of availabledestinationsor check out thedestination pagefor a searchable list broken down by category.
A warehouse is a central repository of data collected from one or more sources. This is what commonly comes to mind when you think about a relational database: structured data that fits neatly into rows and columns.
In Segment, a Warehouse is a special type of destination. Instead of streaming data to the destination all the time, we load data to them in bulk at regular intervals. When we load data, we insert and update events and objects, and automatically adjust their schema to fit the data you’ve sent to Segment.
WithReverse ETL, your data warehouse acts as your source, enabling you to send data from your warehouse to your destinations.
The Sources and Destinations pages allow each user to decide what information appears in their personal view for each page.
On both pages, you can click the stack icon in the upper right-hand corner of the table to see and select Source properties to show. You can select up to five columns of properties.
The following information is available for Sources:
On the Destinations page, you can choose among the following properties:
You can then sort or filter each column to just the values you care about, by clicking on the arrow next to each displayed column.
Sources without any enabled destinations are auto-disabled after 14 days. However, the workspace owner is notified by email before Segment disables the source. Data that flows into Segment but does not flow to any downstream tools is not valuable to you and unnecessarily takes up space.
Segment understands there may be cases to keep a source active. If you’d like to add your sources to an exception list, you can do so by filling out thisAirtable form.
Yes, you are able to submit an integration request here https://segment.com/requests/integrations/.

The Segment Spec provides guidance on meaningful data to capture, and the best format for it, across all of Segment’s libraries and APIs. If you implement Segment using these formats, it’s simple to translate your data to downstream tools.
Check out our high-level overview of these APIs in Segment University. (Must be logged in to access.)
Event and Product Limits
Events ingested by Segment are subject to definedProduct Limits.
The Segment Spec has three components.
First, itoutlines the semantic definition of the customer data Segment captures across all libraries and APIs.  There are six API calls in the Spec. They each represent a distinct type of semantic information about a customer. Every call shares the samecommon fields.
Second, itdetails the event data Segment captures across some cloud sources and destinations.
Third, itshares the events Segment recommends you track for a particular industry based on experience working with thousands of customers. When you respect these specs, Segment maps these events to particular features within end destinations like Google Analytics and Facebook Ads.

The Page call lets you record whenever a user sees a page of your website, along with any optional properties about the page. Calling Page orScreenin a Segmentsourceis one of the first steps to getting started with Segment.
Check out our high-level overview of the Page method in Segment University. (Must be logged in to access.)
Note: Inanalytics.jsa Page call is included in the snippet by defaultjust afteranalytics.load. Many destinations require this page event to be fired at least once per page load for proper initialization. You may add an optionalnameorpropertiesto the default call, or call it multiple times per page load if you have a single-page application.
Here’s the payload of a typical Page call with mostcommon fieldsremoved:
And here’s the corresponding JavaScript event that would generate the above payload. If you’re using Segment’s JavaScript library, the page name and URL are automatically gathered and passed as properties into the event payload:
Based on the library you use, the syntax in the examples might be different. You can find library-specific documentation on theSources Overviewpage.
Beyond the common fields, the Page call takes the following fields:
Here’s a complete example of a Page call:
Use the following interactive code pen to see what your Page calls would look like with user-provided information:
The User ID is a unique identifier for the user performing the actions. Check out theUser ID docsfor more detail.
The Anonymous ID can be any pseudo-unique identifier, for cases where you don’t know who the user is, but you still want to tie them to an event. Check out theAnonymous ID docsfor more detail.
Note: In our browser and mobile libraries a User ID is automatically addedfrom the state stored by a previousidentifycall, so you do not need to add it yourself. They will also automatically handle Anonymous IDs under the covers.
Properties are extra pieces of information that describe the page. They can be anything you want.
Segment handles properties with semantic meanings in unique ways. For example, Segment always expectspathto be a page’s URL path, andreferrerto be the previous page’s URL.
You shouldonly use reserved properties for their intended meaning.
Reserved properties Segment has standardized:
Note:Inanalytics.js, Segment automatically sends the following properties:title,path,url,referrer, andsearch.

The Track API call is how you record any actions your users perform, along with any properties that describe the action.
Check out our high-level overview of the Track method in Segment University. (Must be logged in to access.)
Each action is known as an event. Each event has a name, likeUser Registered, and properties. For example, aUser Registeredevent might have properties likeplanoraccountType. Calling Track in one of oursourcesis one of the first steps to getting started with Segment.
Here’s the payload of a typical Track call with mostcommon fieldsremoved:
And here’s the corresponding JavaScript event that would generate the above payload:
Based on the library you use, the syntax in the examples might be different. You can find library-specific documentation on theSources Overviewpage.
Beyond the common fields, the Track call has the following fields:
Here’s a complete example of a Track call:
Use the following interactive code pen to see what your Track calls look like with user-provided information:
The User ID is a unique identifier for the user performing the actions. Check out theUser ID docsfor more detail.
The Anonymous ID can be any pseudo-unique identifier, for cases where you don’t know who the user is, but you still want to tie them to an event. Check out theAnonymous ID docsfor more detail.
Note: In our browser and mobile libraries a User ID is automatically addedfrom the state stored by a previousidentifycall, so you do not need to add it yourself. They will also automatically handle Anonymous IDs under the covers.
Every Track call records a single user action. Segment calls these “events”, and recommend that you make your event names human-readable, so that everyone on your team (even you, after all that caffeine) can know what they mean instantly.
Don’t use nondescript names likeEvent 12orTMDropd. Instead, use unique but recognizable names likeVideo RecordedandOrder Completed.
Segment recommends event names built from a noun and past-tense verb.For more information about best practices in event naming, check out Segment’sAnalytics Academy lesson on best practices for naming conventions for clean data.
Segment has standardized a series of reserved event names that have special semantic meaning. We map these events to tools that support them whenever possible. See theSemantic Events docsfor more detail.
Properties are extra pieces of information you can tie to events you track. They can be anything that will be useful while analyzing the events later. Segment recommends sending properties whenever possible because they give you a more complete picture of what your users are doing.
Segment has reserved some properties that have semantic meanings, and handle them in special ways. For example, we always expectrevenueto be a dollar amount that we send to tools that handle revenue tracking.
You shouldonly use reserved properties for their intended meaning.
The following are all of the reserved properties Segment has standardized that apply to all events. Check out theSemantic Events docsfor properties specific to individual reserved events.
Note:You might be used to some destinations recognizing special properties differently. For example, Mixpanel has a specialtrack_chargesmethod for accepting revenue. Luckily, you don’t have to worry about those inconsistencies. Just pass alongrevenue.Segment will handle all of the destination-specific conversions for you automatically.Same goes for the rest of the reserved properties.
All events have the ability to include additional event data in thecontextobject. There may be instances when your team may want to include user traits or group traits in a Track event, such as having a single event trigger multiple events in an Actions destination. Since user Traits are not standard fields for a Track event, in order to do this, you’ll need to explicitely pass the user’s traits into the event payload’scontext.traitsobject.For instructions on how to pass fields to the context object for a specific library, please see the related library’s Source documentation.
Segment’s Actions destinations allows your team to build individual actions that are triggered based on a set of configured conditions. By adding the user’s latest traits to the Track event’scontext.traitsobject, its possible to build two separate Actions to be triggered by this single event. For example, if your team would like to send an Identify event anytime the specific Track event “Button Clicked” is triggered, simply add the available traits into the Track event’s payload, then build a destination Actions for the Track event :Event Name is Button Clicked, and a destination Action for the Identify event :All of the following conditions are true: Event Name is Button Clicked, Event Context traits exists, and then both Actions will have access to reference thecontext.traitsfields within its mappings.
For more information on the context object, please see theSpec: Common Fieldsdocumentation.
If theExample Payloadshared above is modified as the eventButton Clickedwith"username": "testing-123"in thecontext.traitsobject, then the event’s payload would be :
Here’s what that Identify Action would look like :
Context is a dictionary of extra information that provides useful context about a datapoint, for example the user’sipaddress orlocale. You shouldonly useContext fields for their intended meaning.

Paragraphs:
On this page
The Group API call is how you associate an individual user with a group, such as a company, organization, account, project, or team.
The Group call enables you to identify what account or organization your users are part of. There are two IDs that are relevant in a Group call: theuserId, which belongs and refers to the user, and thegroupId, which belongs and refers to the specific group. A user can be in more than one group which would mean differentgroupIds, but the user will only have oneuserIdthat is associated to each of the different groups. Keep in mind that not all platforms support multiple groups for a single user.
Check out our high-level overview of these APIs in Segment University. (Must be logged in to access.)
In addition to thegroupId, which is how you’d identify the specific group or company, the group method receives traits that are specific to the group, like industry or number of employees for example, that belong to that specific account. Like the traits of an identify call, you can update these when you call the same trait with a different value.
When using the Group call, it’s helpful if you have accounts with multiple users.
Segment doesn't have an ungroup call
If you’re using a device-mode destination that has a method for ungrouping users, you can invoke it directly on the client sideusing Segment’s ready() method.
For cloud-mode destinations, you cancreate a Destination Functionto ungroup users.
Here’s the payload of a typical Group call, with mostcommon fieldsremoved:
And here’s the corresponding JavaScript event that would generate the above payload:
Based on the library you use, the syntax in the examples might be different. You can find library-specific documentation on theSources Overviewpage.
Beyond the common fields, the Group call takes the following fields:
Here’s a complete example of a Group call:
Use the following interactive code pen to see what your Group calls would look like with user-provided information:
The User ID is a unique identifier for the user performing the actions. Check out theUser ID docsfor more detail.
The Anonymous ID can be any pseudo-unique identifier, for cases where you don’t know who the user is, but you still want to tie them to an event. Check out theAnonymous ID docsfor more detail.
Note: In our browser and mobile libraries a User ID is automatically addedfrom the state stored by a previousidentifycall, so you do not need to add it yourself. They will also automatically handle Anonymous IDs under the covers.
A Group ID is the unique identifier which you recognize a group by in your own database. For example, if you’re using MongoDB it might look something like507f191e810c19729de860ea.
Traits are pieces of information you know about a group that are passed along with the Group call, likeemployeesorwebsite.
Segment has reserved some traits that have semantic meanings for groups, and handles them in special ways. You shouldonly use reserved traits for their intended meaning.
The following are the reserved traits Segment has standardized:
Note:You might be used to some destinations recognizing special properties differently. For example, Mixpanel has a specialtrack_chargesmethod for accepting revenue. Luckily, you don’t have to worry about those inconsistencies. Just pass alongrevenue.Segment handles all of the destination-specific conversions for you automatically.Same goes for the rest of the reserved properties.
If you pass these values,on nullwill throw aNullPointerException.
You may continue to set values inside the trait.  If you do so, this would work the same as the rules do with NoSQL data. If you had set a value previously for a user and on the next request you sent the same value of that property ason null, it will be replaced bynull, but if you do not send that property, the original value is persisted.
Traits are case-insensitive, so in JavaScript you can match the rest of your camel-case code by sendingcreatedAt, and in Ruby you can match your snake-case code by sendingcreated_at. That way the API never seems alien to your code base.

Paragraphs:
On this page
The Segment Identify call lets you tie a user to their actions and record traits about them.  It includes a unique User ID and any optional traits you know about the user, like their email, name, and more.
Check out our high-level overview of the Identify method in Segment University. (Must be logged in to access.)
Segment recommends that you make an Identify call:
The first three examples are pretty self-explanatory, but many might ask: why you would call Identify on every page load if you’re storing theuserIdin the cookie/local storage?
Calling Identify in one of Segment’slibrariesis one of the first steps to getting started with Segment. Refer to library-specific documentation for more details.
Here’s the payload of a typical Identify call with mostcommon fieldsremoved:
And here’s the corresponding JavaScript event that would generate the above payload:
Based on the library you use, the syntax in the examples might be different. You can find library-specific documentation on theSources Overviewpage.
Beyond the common fields, an Identify call has the following fields:
Note that these traits coming in from your source events are calledcustom traits.
Here’s a complete example of an Identify call:
Use the following interactive code pen to see what your Identify calls would look like with user-provided information:
The Identify call specifies a customer identity that you can reference across the customer’s whole lifetime.Every Identify call must have aUser IDor anAnonymous ID, depending on how much you know about the user in question.
There are certain cases where you don’t actually know who the user is according to your database, but you still want to be able to tie them to traits, events, or page views. For example, you may not know who a user is when tracking newsletter signups or anonymous page views.
In these cases, you should use an Anonymous ID.
The Anonymous ID can be any pseudo-unique identifier. For example, on your servers you can use a session id. If you don’t have any readily available identifier, you can always generate a new random one — Segment recommendsUUIDv4 format.
Segment’sbrowser and mobile librariesautomatically use Anonymous IDs to keep track of users as they navigate around your website or app, so you don’t need to worry about them when using those libraries.
Here’s an example of a JavaScript event for an anonymous user:
User IDs are a more permanent and robust identifier, like a database ID. Since these IDs are consistent across a customer’s lifetime, Identify calls should include a User ID as often as possible.
A User ID is usually the unique identifier that you recognize a user by in your own database. For example, if you’re using MongoDB, User IDs might look something like this:507f191e810c19729de860ea.
Segment recommends using database IDs,inuuidv4format, instead of email addresses or usernames because database IDsneverchange. That guarantees that even if the user changes their email address, you can still recognize them as the same person in all of your analytics tools, and you’ll be able to correlate analytics data with your own internal database.
Instead of using an email address or a username as a User ID, send them along ascustom traits.
Custom traitsare pieces of information you know about a user that are included in an Identify call. These could be demographics likeageorgender, account-specific likeplan, or even things like whether a user has seen a particular A/B test variation.
Segment has reserved some custom traits that have semantic meanings for users, and will handle them in special ways. For example, Segment always expectsemailto be a string of the user’s email address. Segment sends this on to destinations likeMailchimpthat require an email address for their tracking.
Only use reserved traits for their intended meaning.
Reserved custom traits Segment has standardized:
You might be used to some destinations recognizing special traits by slightly different names. For example, Mixpanel recognizes a$createdtrait when the user’s account was first created, while Intercom recognizes the same trait ascreated_atinstead. Segment attempts to handle all the destination-specific conversions for you automatically. If you need help understanding if a specific field will be converted to a destination, take a look at Segment’sopen source integration code, view the destination’s documentation, orcontact Segment support.
You can pass these reserved traits using camelCase or snake_case, so in JavaScript you can match the rest of your camelCase code by sendingfirstName, while in Ruby you can match your snake-case code by sendingfirst_name. That way the API never seems alien to your code base. Keep in mind that not all destinations support these reserved traits, so sending these traits in camelCase and snake_case can result in two sets of traits in other destinations.

The Alias method is an advanced method used to merge 2 unassociated user identities, effectively connecting 2 sets of user data in one profile.
Alias and Unify
Alias calls can’t be used to merge profiles inUnify. For more information on how Unify merges user profiles, view theIdentity Resolution documentation.
Alias is an advanced method
The Alias method allows you to explicitly change the ID of a tracked user. This should only be done when it’s required for downstream destination compatibility. See theBest Practices for Identifying Usersdocs for more information.
The Alias call has the following fields:
The Alias method follows the format below:

Paragraphs:
On this page
This page is a guide for developers who want to track interactions with AI copilots using Segment. It explains what data to send to Segment, letting you understand customer interactions with AI copilots.
AI copilots are like virtual assistants that help customers in conversations.
Each conversation starts when a customer sends their first message or question. Throughout the conversation, Segment can track various events that capture key moments, like messages sent and received, tools invoked, and media generated.
While some copilot conversations have clear ending points, which occur when the customer explicitly indicates that the conversation is over, the tracked events provide valuable insights into the entire conversation flow.
In this section, you’ll find the tracked semantic events that serve as a starting point for AI copilot events. You can extend them based on your own requirements.
This table lists the events that you can track from any conversation:
Segment can also track the following live chat events:
This section contains the structure and properties of each AI copilot tracked event.
The Conversation Started event should be sent when a customer sends their first message.
This event supports the following semantic properties:
Here’s an example of a Conversation Started call:
The Message Sent event should be sent when a user adds a new message to a thread. The default forroleis"customer".
This event supports the following semantic properties:
Here’s an example of a Message Sent call:
The Message Received event should be sent when the copilot gives a non-custom response (either text or voice) to something the user asked.
The default forroleis"agent". You can extendroleto different agent type, likeai_agent,human_agent,task_automation_agent, and so on.
This event supports the following semantic properties:
The Conversation Ended event should be sent when a customer or agent explicitly indicates that the conversation has ended or deletes the chat.
This event supports the following semantic property:
Here’s an example of a Conversation Ended call:
The Action nvoked event should be sent when the copilot or user uses a custom capability or tool, like making a call to an external API.
This event supports the following semantic properties:
Here’s an example of an Action Invoked call:
This event should be sent when an image, video, or custom audio is generated by the model.
This event supports the following semantic properties:
Here’s an example of a Media Generated call:
This event should be sent when a new, custom component is shown to the user that isn’t text or voice.
This event supports the following semantic properties:
Here’s an example of a Component Loaded call:
This event should be sent when a user rates a conversation or message.
This event supports the following semantic properties:
Here’s an example of a Feedback Submitted call:
This event should be sent when a new user is identified, either anonymously or as a known user.
This event supports the following semantic properties:
Here’s an example of an Identify call:
When sending events to Segment based on user actions, like items purchased or support requested, make sure to include relevant identifiers for accurate tracking and analysis.
These identifiers includeconversationIdandmessageId, among others, depending on the specific tracked action:
For example, to track an event where a user makes a purchase, the standard Track call could look like this:

In the SegmentSpecall theAPI callshave a common structure, and a few common fields.
However, not all destinations accept all fields included in the Spec. Not sure which fields a destination accepts? Refer to the destination’s documentation page, or check out theopen-source destination code on GitHub.
Check out our high-level overview of these APIs in Segment University. (Must be logged in to access.)
Every API call has the same core structure and fields. These fields describe user identity, timestamping, and mechanical aides like API version.
Here’s an example of these common fields in raw JSON:
In more detail these common fields for every API call are:
Beyond this common structure, each API call adds a few specialized top-level fields.
Context is a dictionary of extra information that provides useful context about a datapoint, for example the user’sipaddress orlocale. You shouldonly useContext fields for their intended meaning.
Below is a chart that shows you which context variables are populated automatically by the iOS, Android, and analytics.js libraries.
Other libraries only collectcontext.library, any other context variables must be sent manually.
IPv6
Segment doesn’t support automatically collecting IPv6 addresses.
The Android library collectsscreen.densitywiththis method.
userAgentData is only collected if theClient Hints APIis available on the browser.
Segment doesn’t collect or append to the context of subsequent calls in the new mobile libraries (Swift, Kotlin, and React Native).
To pass the context variables which are not automatically collected by Segment’s libraries, you must manually include them in the event payload. The following code shows how to passgroupIdas the context field of Analytics.js’s.track()event:
To add fields to the context object in the new mobile libraries, you must utilize a custom plugin. Documentation for creating plugins for each library can be found here:
A dictionary of destination names that the message should be sent to.'All'is a special key that applies when no key for a specific destination is found.
Integrations defaults to the following:
This is becauseSalesforcehas strict limits on API calls.
Sending data to the rest of Segment’s destinations is opt-out so if you don’t specify the destination as false in this object, it will be sent to rest of the destinations that can accept it.
Every API call has four timestamps,originalTimestamp,timestamp,sentAt, andreceivedAt.They’re used for very different purposes.
All timestamps areISO-8601date strings, and are in the UTC timezone.To see the user’s timezone information, check thetimezonefield that’s automatically collected byclient-side libraries.
You must use ISO-8601 date strings that include timezones when you use timestamps withEngage. If you send custom traits without a timezone, Segment doesn’t save the timestamp value.
TheoriginalTimestamptells you when call was invoked on the client device or the value oftimestampthat you manually passed in.
Note:TheoriginalTimestamptimestamp is not useful for any analysis since it’s not always trustworthy as it can be easily adjusted and affected by clock skew.
ThesentAttimestamp specifies the clock time for the client’s device when the network request was made to the Segment API. For libraries and systems that send batched requests, there can be a long gap between a datapoint’stimestampandsentAt. Combined withreceivedAt, Segment usessentAtto correct the originaltimestampin situations where a user’s device clock cannot be trusted (mobile phones and browsers). ThesentAtandreceivedAttimestamps are assumed to occur at the same time (maximum a few hundred milliseconds), and therefore the difference is the user’s device clock skew, which can be applied back to correct thetimestamp.
Note:ThesentAttimestamp is not useful for any analysis since it’s tainted by user’s clock skew.
Segment now adds `sentAt` to a payload when the batch is complete and initially tried to the Segment API for the Swift, Kotlin, and C# mobile libraries
This update changes the value of the Segment-calculatedtimestampto align closer with thereceivedAtvalue rather than theoriginalTimestampvalue. For most users who are online when events are sent, this does not significantly impact their data. However, if your application utilizes an offline mode where events are queued up for any period of time, thetimestampvalue for those users now more closely reflects when Segment received the events rather than the time they occurred on the users’ devices.
ThereceivedAttimestamp is added to incoming messages as soon as they hit the API. It’s used in combination withsentAtto correct clock skew, and also to aid with debugging libraries and systems that deliver events in batches.
ThereceivedAttimestamp is most important as the sort key in Segment’s Warehouses product. Use this for max query speed when retrieving data from your Warehouse.
Note:Chronological order of events is not ensured withreceivedAt.
Thetimestamptimestamp specifies when the data point occurred, corrected for client-device clock skew. This is the timestamp that is passed to downstream destinations and used for historical replays. It is important to use this timestamp for importing historical data to the API.
If you are using the Segment server Source libraries, or passing calls directly to the HTTP API endpoint, you can manually set thetimestampfield. This change updates theoriginalTimestampfield of the Segment event. If you use a Segment Source in device mode, the library generatestimestampand you cannot manually set one directly in the call payload.
Segment calculatestimestampastimestamp = receivedAt - (sentAt - originalTimeStamp).
For client-side tracking it’s possible for the client to spoof theoriginalTimeStamp, which may result in a calculatedtimestampvalue set in the future.
If you’re using one of Segment’s client-side libraries, please note that several factors can cause timestamp discrepancies in your event data.

Paragraphs:
On this page
One of the core components of the SegmentSpecis theTrackmethod. It records any arbitrary event that the user has triggered. For Mobile tracking, in addition to Screen calls, you’ll want to sendspecific event namesthat Segment recognizes semantically. That way, Segment can transform them correctly before sending them off to downstream destinations.
By standardizing the events that comprise the coremobile application lifecycleand associatedmobile campaign and referral events, Segment and its partners can, wherever possible, forward these events on your behalf and build downstream destinations that take full advantage of the semantic meaning associated with these events and their properties.
If you’re already collecting similar events, Segment recommends migrating to these event names so that you can take advantage of available features in Segment destinations that depend on the spec as they become available.
These events pair nicely with Segment’secommerce specfor mobile marketplaces to take full advantage of features like dynamic ads in Facebook and the ability to take full advantage of server-side destinations with Mobile Attribution Platforms likeTuneandKochava.
Per thePrivacy Policyand applicable terms, don’t send Segment sensitive personal information about your users. Certain features from Segment and its partners allow you to opt-in to automatically track data (for example: Application Installed or Deep Link Clicked). When working with these features and Segment in general, be cognizant of the data that is being tracked to ensure its matching both your obligations under your agreement with Segment and the privacy expectations of your users.
The Segment Native Mobile Spec includes the following semantic events:
Application Lifecycle Events
Campaign Events
Segment recommends using the above event names if you’re going to be integrating the events yourself. This will ensure that they can be mapped effectively in downstream tools.
Mobile applications live within a fairly bounded lifecycle. To understand and communicate effectively with your users, it’s crucial to instrument the core flows associated with installing and opening your app. The following events allow you to get a picture of top-line metrics such as DAUs, MAUs, and Screen Views per session. Automatic lifecycle event tracking is optional - you can learn how to enable and disable them in Segment’s docs for each library below:
The following events will be tracked automatically when lifecycle events are enabled in all mobile libraries:
In Kotlin, Swift, and React Native, the following additional events are tracked:
In Swift, the following event is also tracked:
This event fires when a userfirstopens your mobile application. Note, if the user never opens your app after installing, Segment will not collect this event. This event doesn’t wait for attribution or campaign information to be received, and is collected automatically by Segment’s SDKs. Advertising providers like Facebook and Google require discrete install events to correctly attribute installs to ads served through their platform.
This event fires when a user launches or foregrounds your mobile application after the first open. It will fire after theApplication Installedevent and again after the app is re-opened after being closed. This event does not wait for attribution information to be received but may include information about referring applications or deep link URLs if available to the application upon open.
This event should be sent when a user backgrounds the application uponapplicationDidEnterBackground.
This event is fired when a user opens the app or brings it back into the foreground of their device. This is only collected by the Swift library.
This event fires when a user updates the application. Segment’s SDK will automatically collect this event instead of an “Application Opened” event when we determine that the Open is first since an update.
Fire this event when a user uninstalls the application. Some destination partners will detect this for you using Silent Push Notifications through their SDK. You might be able to send these events to Segment using a callback. Visit the partner docs to see if this is available.
You can send this event when you receive a crash notification from your app, but it is not meant to supplant traditional crash reporting tools. By tracking crashes as an analytics event with device and user information, you can analyze the which types of users are impacted by crashes and how those crashes, in turn, affect their engagement. You may also want to target those customers with tailored communications in other channels if they’ve encountered several crashes. Segment does not collect this event. To capture the event, use a destination that collects this data and route that event back to Segment through a webhook or some other callback.
As the walls between apps become increasingly lowered, capturing information about the content and campaigns that drive users to engage with your app is critical to building more targeted, relevant, personalized experiences for your users.
Segment does not collect any campaign events automatically unless configured to do so.
When Segment or an integrated partner can discern the source of an install, we’ll collect anInstall Attributedevent. This event may be sent to Segment using server-to-server connection from your attribution provider, or directly on the device using packaged destinations. In either case, this will happenafterinstall, and does not apply to all installs, which is why it is a discrete event.
This event can be sent when a push notification is received in the app. It can be automatically enabled oniOS.
This event can be sent when a user taps on a push notification associated with your app. It can be automatically enabled oniOS.
This event fires when a push notification from a provider bounces. If your push notification provider forwards push lifecycle events to Segment, they should include this event in their suite.
When your application is opened using a referring link, Segment or your packaged deep link partner can fire this event on your behalf. If the deep link has additional data associated with it, either passed through the third party service or asannotationsinlaunchOption, you may want to include those values as properties here as well.
This event is firedin additionto the associatedApplication Openedevent.
This event may be provided by deep link providers postback mechanisms or an internal redirect service if you use one in order to provide a waypoint funnel step between your content or advertisement and the resulting app open.

Paragraphs:
TheNative Mobile Specis a common blueprint for the mobile user lifecycle. The Spec outlines the most important events for mobile apps to be tracking and automatically collects many of these events with the Segment Android and iOS SDKs.
This article outlines common questions about our Native Mobile Spec. To learn what the benefits are of the feature, check out ourblog. For technical set up and documentation, see ourspec docs.
Smaller SDK: Move more destinations to the server-side, including the Facebook App Events destination.
Less engineering time: Automatically collect key user events instead of coding them in yourself.
Faster time to value: Set up your destinations with key metrics like Daily Active Users, sessions, and in-app purchases right away!
Measure ROI of campaigns: Analyze campaign performance with spec’d events like “campaign hit”, “install attributed” and “push notification opened” in your favorite analytics or BI tool.
OurFacebook App Eventscloud-mode destination currently takes advantage of the “Application Installed” event to power new features like custom audience creation, dynamic ads and conversion tracking, without needing to sit on the device. Soon, more destinations like Google Adwords and Salesforce Marketing Cloud and attribution providers will offer similar functionality.
When an engineer installs the SDK, the SDK will automatically register on iOS and Android operation system handlers.
When the application is foregrounded on the phone, our SDK will be called and emit the Application Opened event. Similarly, when the user updates the app, on the next app open, the iOS and Android operation system will tell us and we’ll emit a track event called Application Updated event. In-app purchases will trigger Order Completed, etc.
This feature is opted out by default. You have to opt in to collect these events as mentioned in our Quick Start guides (iOS,Android). You’ll be doing this in code by altering the configuration you pass into the SDK initialization methods (telling the SDK to collect these events automatically).
Yes, they will be double counted, but that’s only if you opt into this feature. You can either remove your own tracking code for these events or not opt into auto collection at all.
Yes. If you follow the Spec when you write your own custom events, you will be able to take advantage of certain features in downstream destinations on the server-side, like with ourFacebook App Events destination.
We recommend migrating to these event names if you’re tracking similar events so that you can take advantage of available features in our integrations which will depend on the spec as they become available.
Not currently.
Not currently.Contact usfor alternative options.
You can, but the sooner you switch to the spec’d events, the further back you’ll be able to look in your reporting with the same event name!
In the coming months, we’ll be updating our mobile marketing destinations to automatically capture campaign events around attribution, deep linking, and push notifications. These events will go todestinations, includingwarehouses.
Android applications can’t receive Push Notifications when the process is not running, and when apps are put into background they are eligible to have their Process killed when there is memory pressure. For more more on Android processes, view Android’sProcesses and app lifecycle documentation.
Segment tracks messages delivered to the application. So if the process has been killed for any reason, messages won’t be delivered.
Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) has its own servers. When an FCM message is created and sent to a device, that message travels through FCM servers and is delivered to the local FCM client device that is part of Android OS. This FCM client is almost always running, even when the app is backgrounded. From there, the FCM message is intended to be delivered to a local application. If the app process is running, the message gets delivered. Otherwise, the user must tap a notification that starts the app and delivers the FCM message.
For more context on how this process works, view theFirebase FCM architecture documentation.

Paragraphs:
When it comes to Mobile SDKs, we know that minimizing size and complexity is a priority for our customers. That’s why our core Mobile SDKs are small and offload as much work as possible in handling destinations to our servers. When you install our light-weight SDK, you have access to our entire suite of server-side destinations.
We bundle certain SDKs, instead of just proxying your data to them through our servers, so that you have access to their deeper features that requires direct client manipulation (A/B testing, user surveys, touch heatmapping, etc) or access to rich data such as CPU usage, network data, or raised exceptions. For those types of features, we still need to bundle their native SDK for you so you can make the most of them.
We’ve worked hard to make our mobile SDKs as modular as possible so that you only need to include the SDKs for tools you plan to use.
Custom builds allow us to offer the native functionality of all of our destinations without having to include hefty third-party SDKs by default. This gives you control over size and method bloat. Check out how to use custom builds for bothAndroidandiOS.
To check if a destination is bundled or not, take a look at ourdocumentationfor that specific destination.

One of the core components of the SegmentSpecis theTrackcall. It describes any arbitrary event that the user has triggered. For some industry verticals and applications, Segment has standardized event names. For Ecommerce tracking, for example, there arespecific event names and propertiesthat we recognize semantically. This semantic meaning allows Segment to specially recognize and transform key events before sending them off to each different tool.
There are a few places where Segment has standardized event names and properties already:
In the future Segment plans to standardize event names from other data sources as well.

This guide explains how B2B SaaS companies should send core user and account lifecycle data to Segment.
Most B2B SaaS companies have a few common, core lifecycle events for users and accounts. We understand that account hierarchies can be unique and complex, but by following this spec you can take advantage of account-based tools on Segment platform, and B2B SaaS data products by Segment.
The B2B SaaS category has the following semantic events:
This event should be sent when a new account is created.
This event supports the following semantic properties:
This event should be sent when an account is deleted.
This event supports the following semantic properties:
This event should be sent when a user signs up for your service.
Good to know: Segment’s best practice is to use an “Object-Action” naming convention, which in this case would be “User Signed Up”. However, because in the B2B case this may not be a specific user, we omit that noun in our example. You may include or omit it as needed for your implementation.
This event supports the following semantic properties:
This event should be sent when a user signs in to your service.
Good to know: Segment’s best practice is to use an “Object-Action” naming convention, which in this case would be “User Signed In”. However, because in the B2B case this may not be a specific user, we omit that noun in our example. You may include or omit it as needed for your implementation.
This event supports the following semantic properties:
This event should be sent when a user signs out for your service. You should also callanalytics.reset()to refresh the cookie when a Signed Out event occurs.

Paragraphs:
On this page
When tracking your data, it’s important to set yourself up for success. E-commerce and retail companies want to use their data to understand why some customers fall out of their funnels or why customers become repeat buyers. They want to understand the important lifecycle events that lead up to the sale of a physical item, so they can, for example, test whether personalized shopping experiences yield higher conversions, or build a multi-channel cart abandonment campaign. But first, they need to make sure those lifecycle events are being captured in their datasets.
That’s where a tracking plan comes in. A tracking plan is a living document that can be used across your organization to record what events and properties to track, where you’ll be tracking them in your code base, and why you’re tracking them.
Learn more about the value and function of a tracking plan.
In this guide, you’ll learn the core events most relevant to e-commerce companies that can get you started immediately in understanding your customers and driving sales.
Talk to a product specialist todayabout building a clean, high-quality data spec so you can focus on brand engagement and sales growth.
Before diving into specific event tracking, you’ll want to make sure you track who your users are with the the.identify()call. You should call.identify()whenever a visitor provides you with a piece of information, at which point they become “known users.” The.identify()call creates or updates a record of your customer with a set of traits in your tools and warehouse. But how do you choose which traits about your user to include?
Traits are pieces of data that you track about a specific user. Read the guide about selecting traits to learn more.
Here are the most common user traits e-commerce companies include in their tracking:
Here are a few examples of other helpful user traits:
Here is a sample.identify()call for Segment:
In analytics.js:
In analytics-ios:
In analytics-android:
The main benefits of using the traits listed above are:
You can use the traits to personalize content in your email or push notification tools by inserting their information. For example:
You can create cohorts based on the traits in any of your tools. For example, you could useorder_countto determine how many of your users are first or repeat, orexperimentsto determine how many have seen this particular experiment variant
Given the power you have in your downstream tools to create cohorts based on these dimensions, you may be tempted to throw more contextual data into thetraits, such as UTM params, IP addresses, and userAgents. But if you’re using Segment’s client-side analytics.js library, then all of these contextual pieces of data are automatically collected.
Now that you are tracking who your users are, you can work on what they’re doing on your website or in your app with a.track()call. Tracking customer events lets you learn about your customers, measure the impact of your marketing efforts and product decisions, and proactively engage your customers in a meaningful way that drives sales.
Read the event tracking guide to learn more about tracking the right events.
E-commerce businesses, unlike SaaS or consumer apps that optimize for product engagement, focus on directing users down their funnels to a conversion goal, like purchasing a product. To best understand why customers convert, it’s important to track and measure all key funnel events.
There are also auxiliary actions to track to measure your customer’s engagement with your site. These actions are good to track so you can better understand their intent on your website.
Lastly, Segment has a set of semantic campaign events that are automatically collected so you can understand the conversions in these specific channels:
Check out the full list of e-commerce events you should track.
You may notice a pattern in the event names. Segment selected the “Object Action” naming convention to ensure that all event data is clean and easily analyzable, while choosing “snake_case” for the traits and properties. It doesn’t matter what you choose, so long as it’s consistent. Without a uniform and enforced naming framework to guide developers that add tracking code later, your data could get marred with conflicting naming structures. Learn more about the importance of naming conventions.
Segment recommends tracking core checkout activity on the server-side. Learn more abouttracking on the client vs. server.
Properties are similar to traits, but they’re associated with specific actions, rather than with an individual user. Each.track()call can accept an optional dictionary ofproperties, which can contain any key-value pair you want. Thesepropertiesact as dimensions that allow your end tool to group, filter, and analyze the events. They give you additional detail on broader events.
Learn more about properties and what they mean for your downstream analysis.
For e-commerce, since most events are customers choosing, browsing, and checking out products, all of the traits must contain key information about the products themselves:
These traits must be included because many tools rely on them for analysis. If there was one of them missing, the call would be ignored.
Using a specific tool and want to see how Segment handles sending calls to it?Check out the documentation.
Here is an example.track()call:
In analytics-node:
In analytics-ios
In analytics-android:
It’s important that these events contain particular properties, such assku, otherwise the downstream tools won’t be able to create out-of-the-box revenue and sales reports. Learn more about semantic properties in the e-commerce spec.
The most successful e-commerce businesses not only efficiently move their customers through the funnel towards conversion, but also have the infrastructure to collect and use customer data. Having a tracking plan focused on key funnel events can help e-commerce businesses get a sense of the health of their funnel.
Aside from funnel health, having these key pieces of customer data gives companies the ability to tailor and personalize each interaction, as well as build marketing campaigns around actions taken or omitted.
Without taking this critical step of mapping out key customer events, businesses often spend too much time revisiting their data model or analyzing impartial data sets. Instead they could spend that time understanding and addressing customers’ needs.

Paragraphs:
On this page
Segment’s video spec helps you define how customers engage with your video and ad content. This document covers the naming syntax and conventions for how you should send events when tracking video analytics.
Note:not all destinations support video tracking, and you should always check with the individual destination documentation to confirm.
Before you start implementing the Segment video spec, you should understand the overall structure and classification of events. The video spec will be organized intothreedistinct event categories:
You can think of playback events being related to the actualplaybackof the video content. This means that these events are meant to track information about the video player (such as pause, resume, or play). Thus, you can think of playback events to be at the session level. For example, when a customer presses play on your video, you would start by sending aVideo Playback Startedevent with a uniquesession_id. In particular, this event should fire after the last user action required for playback to begin.
Then, for the duration of that user’s session with that specific video player, all
subsequent events generated from this session/playback should be tied with the same aforementionedsession_id. So if you had a web page that had two video players, you would have two separate sessions andsession_idswhile contrastingly if you only had one video player on the page but the playback played two video contents in a row, you would only have one session but two contents tied to it.
All playback events share the same event properties that describe information about the current state of the player. Below is a table of the supported properties of this object.
Below is the full list of Video Playback Events.
When a user presses Play; after the last user action required for playback to begin (for example, after user login/authentication).
When a user presses Pause.
When the playback stops unintentionally (such as from network loss, browser close/redirect, or app crash). With this event you can passmethodas a property to denote the cause of the interruption.
When playback starts buffering content or an ad.
When playback finishes buffering content or an ad.
When a user manually seeks a certain position of the content or ad in the playback. Pass in theseek_positionto denote where the user is seeking to, and pass in thepositionproperty to denote where the user is seeking from.
After a user manually seeks to a certain position of the content or ad in the playback. Pass in thepositionproperty to denote where the user desires to begin the playback from.
When playback is resumed, by the user, after being paused.
When playback is complete and only when the session is finished.
When user navigates away from a playback/stream.
Underneath the playback level, we now have thepodlevel. A pod can be seen as a “group” or “segment” of either the content or advertisement.
Consider, for example, a playback session that might have some content and one mid-roll advertisement. This would mean that you would have twocontentpods (since the mid-roll ad split the content playback into two sections) while you might have one ad pod for the mid-roll ad. In this instance, you’d start and complete the first pod of content; you’d start and complete the ad; you’d start and complete the second pod of content. All of this would happen within one playback start.
All content events share the same event properties that describe information about the current video content the user is interacting with. Below is a table of the supported properties of this object.
Below is the full list of Video Content Events.
When a video content segment starts playing within a playback.
Heartbeats that you can fire every n seconds to track how far into the content the user is currently viewing as indicated by theposition.
When a video content segment completes playing within a playback. That is,positionandtotal_lengthare equal.
Just like Content events, Ad Events also live underneath the playback level and at the pod level. A given ad pod can have multiple ad assets (or just one) and a playback session might have multiple ad pods. For example, if your video playback has two pre-roll, one mid-roll, and one post-roll ads, you would have three ad pods:
All ad events share the same event properties that describe information about the current ad content the user is interacting with. Below is a table of the supported properties of this object.
Since some video destinations require sending Content metadata along with Ad metadata, you may need to send your content properties also in all your ad events underproperties.contentdepending on the video destination you’re using.
When you fire aVideo Playback Resumedevent, youshouldimmediately call a Segment heartbeat event (Video Content PlayingorVideo Ad Playingdepending on what the playback resumed to). This should effectively mean that you are also resuming your 10 second heartbeats (since they should’ve been paused after sending Video Playback Paused event).
It’s important to analyze the performance of your video content. To keep track of quality changes, you can track aVideo Quality Updatedevent when there is a change in video quality with the following properties:
Below is an example of how one might implement the video spec:
1) User presses play on a video:
2) Playback starts to play content:
3) User views content for 20 seconds and we have 10 second heartbeats:
4) Playback is paused and resumed:
5) Mid-roll ad starts playing:
6) User watches the full 21 second ad and we have 10 second heartbeats:
7) Content resumes, user finishes the full content:
(Video Content Playinghearbeats every 10 seconds)
8) 11 second post-roll ad plays after content finishes:
9) Playback finishes:

Get started with Segment
Crawling: https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/best-practices-identify/
Paragraphs:
On this page
The most important calls you make with Segment are theidentifyandtrackcalls. When you use these calls together, you can attribute actions on your site or app to individuals, and gain a better understanding of their activities, identity, and use patterns over time. Tracking users with the identify and track calls reduces the number ofMonthly Tracked Usersyou are billed for.
The Identify call specifies a customer identity that you can reference across the customer’s lifetime. There are instances where you want to record information about a user that isn’t already known to you. An example of this might be, a user that visits your site and doesn’t register, but they do give you their email address through a newsletter email sign-up form. In this instance, you would record that email address as a trait, and for the identifier (ID), you would use anonymous ID.
When you make anidentifycall using Segment’s Analytics.js library, Segment saves theuserIdto the browser cookie, and writes all the user traits inlocalStorage. If you’re using one of the Segment mobile libraries, theuserIdand traits are stored in the device’s memory. This makes it possible to append the user’s data to all subsequentpage callsortrack callsfor the user, so you can properly attribute those actions.
If a user returns to your site after thecookie expires, Analytics.js looks for an old ID in the user’slocalStorage, and if one is found, sets it as the user’s ID again in a new cookie. If the user clears their cookiesandlocalStorage, all of the IDs are removed and the user gets a completely newanonymousIdwhen they next visit the page.
Whenever possible, follow the Identify call with a Track event that records what caused the user to be identified.
If you’re using Segment’s browser or mobile libraries, the Segment SDK generates and sets a UUID asanonymousIDat the user’s first visit to your site. ThatanonymousIdis saved in the user’s cookie, as well as localStorage, and will stick with that user until the cache is cleared or aresetcall is triggered.
You can use theanonymousIdto link events performed by the user as they navigate around your website. When you track theanonymousId, you can attribute activities over multiple days to the same user by collecting all of the activities with that ID. If a user chooses to register for your site, or log in to your app, you can Identify them, and still include theiranonymousIdin the event payload along with the newuserId.
If you use Segment’s server libraries, you must generate ananonymousIdmanually. It can be any pseudo-unique identifier, for example, you might use asessionIdfrom a backend server.
Segment recommends that you use a unique user identifier (UUID) that won’t change for youruserId. AuserIdshould be a robust, static, unique identifier that you recognize a user by in your own database systems. Because these IDs are consistent across a customer’s lifetime, you should include auserIdin Identify calls as often as you can. If you don’t have a userId, you need to include an anonymousId in your Identify call in order to record identifying information about your user.
Ideally, theuserIdcould be a database ID. For example, if you’re using MongoDB it might be a row identifier and look something like507f191e810c19729de860ea. These can also beUUIDs that you generate somewhere in your application. You can also use identifiers that you get from other tools - such as Shopify or Braze - however this approach can lead to extra complexity in your systems.
Segment doesnotrecommend using simple email addresses or usernames as a User ID, as these can change over time. Segment recommends that you use static IDs instead, so the IDsneverchange. When you use a static ID, you can still recognize the user in your analytics tools, even if the user changes their email address. And even better, you can link your analytics data with your own internal database.
Tip!Even though Segment doesn’t recommend using an email address or a username as a User ID, you can still send that identifying information in your Identify call astraits.
You should make an Identify call in the following situations:
An anonymous user visits the site for the very first time. The home page has the analytics.js tracking snippet loaded in its header. When the page loads, this sets off the default Page call to Segment. The Segment SDK generates and setsanonymousId.
You can see in this full page event, theanonymousIdis populated, and theuserIdis null.
The user signs up for an email newsletter and fills out the form giving you their first and last name, as well as their email address. At this point, you will fire off an Identify call. You won’t yet assign them a user ID in this example, but you can still grab these traits about them.
You’ll notice the Identify call contains nouserId. These traits will be associated to theanonymousIdthat is available in the user’s cookie andlocalStorage.
An anonymous visitor registers for an account and becomes a known user. The account creation process allows you to assign auserIdfrom your production database and capture additional traits. For this example, theuserIdthat is assigned is “123abc”. This is when you’ll want to fire an Identify call with this user’s newly assigneduserIdand additional traits.
After you fire the Identify call with theuserId, you’ll notice that the payload now has both auserIdandananonymousIdattributed to the user.
The illustration below shows a timeline with a user’s interactions on a website, including sample API calls above that show Segment calls, and the user’sanonymousIdanduserId.

When the user first visits a page, Analytics.js automatically assigns the user ananonymousIdand saves it to the user’slocalStorage. As the user interacts with the site, for example clicking around to different pages, Analytics.js includes thisanonymousIdand somecontextual informationwith each Page and Track call. The contextual information might be the user’sIP address, browser, and more.
When a user signs up to create an account on the website, the.identify("userId")and.track(“Signed Up”)events fire, in that order. You pull theuserIdunique to the user from your systems, and send it to the Segment library so you can label that user’s later events with their ID. The later Track call (“Signed Up”) contains both theuserIdandthe automatically-collectedanonymousIdfor the user, and any other information you capture about them -  such as their first name, last name, and email address.
The example below shows an Identify call including user traits. It uses a database ID (97980cfea0067) as theuserId.
For a Track call, information about this event is stored either in thecontextfield or in the eventproperties. The example below shows a Track call including properties that tell you about the user.
Additionally, Analytics.js adds amessage_idandfour timestampsto the call.
Now, as the user interacts with your site and different buttons or links that you track using Segment, theiruserIdandanonymousIdare sent with each subsequent tracking API call.
Let’s go through some more scenarios to explain how ananonymousIdis assigned and how it might be merged with auserId.
If a user clicks on an ad and is directed to a webpage, they are assigned ananonymousId. While this user is anonymous, they navigate to different pages and click around on the website. Say they come back two days later from the same device, sign up, and are assigned auserIdfrom your database.

For simplicity, we’re assuming that the user hasnotcleared their cookies orlocalStorage, where the originalanonymousIdis stored. If they had, they’d be assigned a newanonymousIdwhen they visited the website, and theuserIdthey got when they register on the website wouldnotbe attached to the activities tracked with the oldanonymousId.
In this scenario, the person uses both a web browser, and a mobile application to interact with your site. In each case, they are assigned a differentanonymousId. In this scenario, the user signs up on the web browser, so Segment assigns theirwebsession auserId. However, because they do not log in on the mobile application, Segment cannot tie the mobile activity to this specific user. Their mobile application activity remains anonymous unless they log in on the mobile application.

Similar to the previous scenario, the user accessed both your website and mobile application, and also logged in on both. In this case, both sessions on the web and mobile app receive the user’suserId, so Segment can tie the anonymous activity on both web and mobile to this user.

Your data warehouse has a schema for each of your Segment sources. User information is stored in two tables in your source schemas - theidentifiesanduserstable.
Theidentifiestable contains all of your identify events, and the timestamps for these events. Every time you make an Identify call, Segment adds theuserId,anonymousId, any updated or added user traits from the call, as well as the timestamp of when the call was made. Youridentifiestable is your first stop when you have questions about users and their traits.
Theuserstable contains only unique Identify method calls, and is a collation of theidentifiestable. Theuserstable is the single source of truth for a user’s most up-to-date traits.
These tables only contain information about a useronce they have been identified.However, you can still find information about ananonymoususer on thepages,screens, andtrackstables, as well as the individual track event tables.
The Segment ID cookie is set with a one year expiration. However, there are some ways an ID can be reset or overwritten:
Remember, if a user has multiple devices, they can have differentanonymousIds on each different device.
If you’re tracking on the client and on the server, theanonymousIdcan be retrieved fromlocalStorageon the client and passed to the server. You can access a user’s anonymousId using the following call:
If you’re identifying on the server, then you will want to pass the user ID from the server to the client using an Identify call with theanonymousId. That will allow theuserIdto be aliased with the existinganonymousIdand stored in the cookie in localStorage. With that, all previous anonymous activity and all subsequent activity is associated to the newly generateduserId, as well as existinganonymousIds.
There are some advantages to sending details about your users directly from your server once the user registers. Server libraryIdentify callsare invisible to the end user, making them more secure, and much more reliable. Or, if you want to send user data that is sensitive or which you don’t want to expose to the client, then you can make an Identify call from the server with all the traits you know about the user. More aboutcollecting data on the client or serverin Segment’s documentation.
If you plan to track anonymous visitors from the browser and only makeIdentify callsfrom your server libraries, Kissmetrics and Mixpanel might require that you make anAlias callto link the records. The Alias call links client-side anonymous visitors with server-identified users. This isn’t recommended, but if you do this, read theKissmetricsandMixpanelspecificaliasdocs.
There are a few things that might cause your numbers to be off.
The most common problem people run into when tracking new user signups client-side is that only a portion of their new users are showing up in reports.
This is usually caused by the page redirecting or reloading before the tracking calls get a chance to run. Segment recommends that you make those calls from a welcome page after the user registers, rather than trying to squeeze in the tracking calls on the sign-up page itself.
This is usually only an issue inMixpanel, since it’s the only destination that requires a call toaliasin the browser to link anonymous browsing history to a new identified user.
Remember that for destinations that require aliasing, you must make theAlias callbefore you make theIdentify callfor that user. Even if you make anIdentify callfrom a server library, it can’t happen before the client-sidealias.
Unfortunately, there is no way to change an existinguserIdwithin Segment. Historical data with an existinguserIdremains the same, and a newuserIdwill not replace the existinguserIdin Segment event call logs. For downstream destinations, consult the corresponding docs about user profile behaviors when using a newuserId.
Changing auserIdis incredibly hard to do, as that is a fundamental part of analytics. While some downstream analytics tools let you change auserIdonce set, others don’t and the process will be different for each tool.

On this page
How do you to determine which type of call you should use? When should you make a Page call instead of a just using a Track call? In theory, youcouldput together a full implementation using only track events, but this is a bad idea - this page explains some of the things you should consider when deciding which call to use.
Segmentstronglyencourages you to followthe Specfor clarity and simplicity’s sake, however we also give you the flexibility to make only the calls that fit your needs. In the end, it is up to you.
Segment recommends that you followthe Spec, which gives general guidance about which methods to use when. You might read about “semantic spec”, which simply means Page calls should be about the page you’re viewing, and Track calls should be about events or activities you want to track.
The Spec outlines the specific data you should collect with each type of call. Each call type represents and is intended to collect specific information about a user or their activities. This means that your choice of method can imply things about the data you intend to collect.
For example, the properties forpage()andscreen()calls are intended to describe the page, not the user or their actions. Similarly, the data automatically included in apage()in particularly is important for UTM campaign capture.
As we mentioned above, youcouldbuild a full Segment implementation using only Track events, and this is probably a bad idea. To do this, you would need to include page-related data in every Track call, which means adding all of the information that Page calls automatically include, except now manually as event properties. As you might imagine, this gets unwieldy fast!
It’s better to pair a Page and a Track call together (making one of each call), especially if you have a complex tracking implementation. When you use the semantic methods you reduce the amount of information and other properties required in a single call.
Thetrack()call, andpage()orscreen()calls are handled very differently by your downstream tools, and how you can use that data is different. When you use the Spec, Segment uses the call type to help translate the data into destination’s tracking format. This ensures the highest level of compatibility with the end tools.
Some destinations were built around a specific call type and Segment maps to those specific methods. Some downstream tools do not acceptpage()andscreen()calls at all. Many of the destinations thatdoaccept these calls, also expect alimitedrange of data in apage()call, and may not properly receive or handle data that would be expected intrack()calls.
To help you with this, the Segment documentation includesa list of all of the supported destinations and the calls they accept.
Finally, when you use the different methods correctly, it can help you separate out “types” of information in your downstream tools and warehouses, so you can use them for different purposes.

A source is a website, server library, mobile SDK, or cloud application which can send data into Segment. It’s where your data originates. Add a source to collect data to understand who your customers are and how they’re using your product. Create a source for each website or app you want to track. While it’s not required that you have a single source for each server, site, or app, you should create a source for each unique source of data.
Each source you create has a write key, which is used to send data to that source. For example, to loadanalytics.js, the Segment JavaScript libraryon your page, the snippet on theQuickstart Guideincludes:
If you don't see the source you're looking for in our catalog
If a tool is not listed as a supported source in Segment’scatalog, then it is not possible to incorporate the integration out-of-the-box within a Segment workspace. However, as an alternative, you can use theHTTP APIsource to collect data from the tool’s API. You can also useFunctionsto send or receive data from other tools.
Segment has three types of sources:
Event streams sources collect data from your website or app to monitor user actions. These sources includewebsite libraries,mobile, andserver sources.
The Source Overview page for an event stream source shows you apipeline viewof all events Segment receives from your source, events that failed on ingest, events that are filtered at the source level, and “eligible events”, which are the events that will flow into your destinations. If you select one of the steps in the pipeline view, you can see a line chart that reflects the fluctuations in volume alongside abreakdown tablethat has more details about the events impacted by the selected step.
The pipeline view shows each of the four steps Segment encounters when processing data from your source:
You can use the time picker located on the Source Overview page to specify a time period (last 10 minutes, 1 hour, 24 hours, 7 days, 2 weeks, or a custom date range over the last two weeks) for which you’d like to see data. Segment sets the time picker to show data for the last 24 hours by default.

The breakdown table displays three tabs,Event type,Event name, andApp version.
Each of these tabs displays an event count, which is the total number of events that Segment received in a particular step.
The Unnamed or batched events under theEvent Nametab is a collection of all identify and page/screen calls in the source.
Analytics.js, the JavaScript library, is the most powerful way to track customer data from your website. If you’re just starting out, Segment recommends it over server-side libraries as the simplest installation for any website.
Analytics and data collection is a very broad topic and it can be quite overwhelming. How do you get started?
Segment’s Mobile SDKs are the best way to simplify your iOS, Android, and Xamarin app tracking. Try them over server-side sources as the default installation for any mobile app.
Analytics-Flutter library
The Analytics-Flutter library is currently only available in pilot phase and is governed by Segment’sFirst Access and Beta Preview Terms. If you’d like to try out this library, access theAnalytics-Flutter GitHub repository.
Segment’s server-side sources let you send analytics data directly from your servers. Segment recommends tracking from your servers when device-mode tracking (tracking on the client) doesn’t work. Check out theguide on server-side trackingif you’re not sure whether it makes sense for your use case.
Cloud-mode tracking
Server-side data management is when tag sends data to the Segment servers, which then passes that data to the destination system.
Cloud app sources empower you to pull together data from all of your different third-party tools into a Segment warehouse or to your other enabled integrated tools. They send data about your users from your connected web apps. There are two types of Cloud Apps:Object cloud sourcesandEvent cloud sources.
Wondering which cloud-apps send which types of data? Check out the Cloud Sources comparison.
These Cloud App Sources can export data from its third party tool and import it directly into your Segment warehouse. Make sure you have a Segment warehouse enabled before you enable any of the following sources:

If Segment doesn’t have a library for your environment, you can send your data directly to theHTTP Tracking API. All of Segment’s other sources and platforms use the HTTP API to work their magic behind the scenes.
Segment’sPixel Tracking APIlets you track events from environments where you can’t execute code, like tracking email opens.
Reverse ETL sources are data warehouses that enable you to useReverse ETLto send data from your warehouse source to your destinations.
Reverse ETL supports these sources:
Segment is actively working on adding more sources. If you’d like to request Segment to add a particular source, please note it on thefeedback form.
To create a source:
Once you’ve created a source, the source is automatically enabled and can immediately receive events. You can review your new events in that source’sDebuggertab.
Sources not connected to an enabled destination are disabled after 14 days
If your source is not connected to any destinations or is only connected to disabled destinations, Segment automatically disables this source after 14 days, even if the source is receiving events. Disabled sources will no longer receive data. 
You can view when Segment disables your destination in your workspace’sAudit TrailasEvent : Source DisabledwithActor : Segment.
Workspace members receive an email notification before Segment disables your source so that your team has time to take action.
If you would like to prevent this behavior in your workspace, fill outthis Airtable form.
One source or multiple sources?
Segment suggests that you create one source for each type of data you want to collect. For example, you might have one source for all of your website tracking and a different source for any mobile tracking. Creating one source per data type provides the following benefits:
Segment has defined three tiers for libraries: Flagship, Maintenance, and Community. These tiers indicate the level of support, enhancements, and maintenance each library receives from Segment.
The criteria for assigning a library to a tier include its overall usage by customers and the availability of newer versions. Here’s how Segment defines each tier:
If a library falls into one of these tiers, you’ll see the tier label at the beginning of the library’s page.

Paragraphs:
On this page
Cloud-App Sources (often shortened to Cloud Sources) allow you to pull in data from third-party tools so you can use it in Segment. There are two types of Cloud Apps:ObjectandEventsources.
As in the basic tracking API,objectsusually contain information about a person or group which is updated over time, whileeventdata happens once, and is appended to a list.
Event Cloud Sources can export their data both into Segment warehouses, and into other enabled Segment integrations that work with event data.
Object Cloud App Sources can export data and import it directly into a Segment warehouse. Youmusthave a Segment warehouse enabled before you enable these. From the warehouse, you can analyze your data with SQL, useReverse ETLto extract data, or use Engage SQL Traits to build audiences. Some examples of Object Cloud sources are Salesforce (account information), Zendesk (support cases), and Stripe (payments information).
In the app, data from website, mobile, and server sources can go to a warehouseorto destinations. Object Cloud-App Source data canonlygo to Warehouses.
Sources are functionally comprised of either one or both of the following components: a “sync” component and a “streaming” component. They work together to populate logical collections of data based on upstream resource availability and following data normalization best practices. These collections may be either events (append only data streams, akin to “facts” in data warehousing parlance) or objects (dimensional values that may be updated based on changes in state upstream).
You enable a cloud source from the Segment web app, and grant Segment access by pasting an API key or authenticating with OAuth. Segment then starts a scheduled job on your behalf which makes requests to the downstream tool, normalizes and transforms the data, and forwards that data to the Segment API.
Cloud sources attempt to use as few API calls as possible, and (where possible) only fetch data that changed since the last sync. The syncs might take a long time (especially on the first sync), so the cloud source syncs have robust retry and rate limiting logic.
Contact Segment Product Supportif you’d like to change the cadence of your source’s sync frequency.
We make an effort to be respectful of your API call allotments and limits. For example, in the case of Salesforce, we issue only one query per collection per run, using the absolute minimum number of API calls possible (typically about 350/day).
Moreover, we’re deliberate about which collections we pull, striking a balance between allowing you to get a full picture of your users and reducing extraneous data (like administrative and metadata tables).
Soon, we’ll allow you to specify which collections you care about during the source set up phase, so if you need to cut down on calls, you’ll be able to just deselect collections.
Streaming components are used to listen in real time to webhooks from downstream cloud sources, normalize and transform the data, and forward it to our APIs.
Both sync and streaming components can forward data to our event tracking and objects upsertion API processing layers, but generally sync components are used to fetch objects and streaming components listen for events.
To use cloud sources, we suggest going through the following steps.
Before you connect a source, check out thesources documentation. See what kind of credentials you will need to enable the source. Different sources require different levels of permissioning.
Next, you’ll also need to get the credentials for yourwarehouse.
Once you have the necessary credentials (or are logged in to OAuth for your cloud source), you should be ready to go!
Based on your plan, you can schedule a certain number of syncs per day. We suggest setting these up so your dashboards and reports are fresh for reporting, but not at the same time of day that a lot of people are querying your database.
The most common reason cloud sources have trouble because of authentication or permission issues. When the issue is related to authentication, you’ll see an “access denied” connection error in your source details. When this happens, Segment quits the process early and does not make any further attempts on any collections.
When you successfully authenticate, but your user lacks the required permissions (for example, if you use an agent login instead of an administrator for Zendesk), Segment attempts to pull each collection and reports errors on a per-collection basis. This helps you troubleshoot why source runs fail, because sometimes permission-based denials are scoped to specific resources from the upstream tool.
Segment attempts to make the errors displayed in the UI clear enough so we don’t need to document all of them. However, if it’s not clear what to do to fix an error you encounter,contact supportand let them know.
Sometimes, when the sync job fails due to an unhandled error or is mysteriously hanging for too long, we’ll kill the job and report a failure with instructions to contact support. When this happens, our support and engineering teams have already been notified of the failure and have the complete set of logs to set about debugging and remediating the issue, but  don’t hesitate to get in touch so they can keep you in the loop!
In general, we’ve focused on pulling all of the collections directly related to the customer experience. We do not automatically pull all collections available from a partner API, since many of them aren’t relevant to the customer journey. You can see a list of the collections we pull in the docsfor each cloud source. Each collection reflects a table in your database.
Contact Segment Product Supportif you need additional data collected, or to change the schema to do the analysis you want. We’d love to know what analysis you’re trying to run, what additional data you need, and we’ll share with the product team to evaluate.
Generally, you need intermediate- to advanced SQL experience to explore and analyze cloud source data in a warehouse. The following resources can help you get up and running more quickly!
Joining IDsAs you start to get into joining across different types of sources, you’ll need a way to join user IDs. Thishelp articleexplains how to do this in detail.
Partner DashboardsOur BI partners at Mode, Looker, BIME, Periscope, and Chartio have created out of the box dashboards that work on top of our source schemas.

Paragraphs:
The Source Debugger is a real-time tool that helps you confirm that API calls made from your website, mobile app, or servers arrive to your Segment Source, so you can troubleshoot your Segment set up even quicker. With the Debugger, you can check that calls are sent in the expected format without having to wait for any data processing.
The Source Debugger’s event order may not reflect how events send downstream or are received by connected destinations. The Debugger primarily confirms incoming data and provides a basic view of its structure. For a reliable record of the data you send to Segment, Segment advises you to attach a raw storage destination to your sources.

The Debugger is separate from your workspace’s data pipeline and is not an exhaustive view of all the events ever sent to your Segment workspace. The Debugger only shows a sample of the events that the Source receives in real time, with a cap of 500 events. The Debugger is a great way to test specific parts of your implementation to validate that events are being fired successfully and arriving to your Source.
To see a more complete view of all your events, Segment recommends that you set up awarehouseor anS3 destination.
The Debugger shows a live stream of sampled events arriving into the Source, but you can also pause the stream from displaying new events by toggling “Live” to “Pause”. Events continue to arrive to your Source while you Pause the stream.
You can search in the Debugger to find a specific payload using any information you know is available in the event’s raw payload. You can also use advanced search options to limit the results to a specific event.

Two views are available when viewing a payload:

Crawling: https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/custom-domain/
Paragraphs:
Custom Domain is available to customers on Business tier plans.See theavailable plans, orcontact Support.
On this page
Custom Domain is a fully-managed service that enables you to configure a first-party subdomain over HTTPS.  You can then track event requests through your own domain (for example,cdp.mydomain.com), instead of the default (segment.com). Tracking events through your own domain allows for more secure and complete first-party data collection by reclaiming first-party data lost to browser controls. With a more complete view of your customer behaviors, you can build more robust profiles for greater attribution and ROAS.
Custom Domain is only available to Business Tier customers
Customers not on the Business Tier but who have interest in Custom Domain shouldcontact Segment’s sales teamfor assistance with upgrading to a Business Tier plan. Segment also offers an alternative DNS record service,Custom Proxy.

Segment recommends configuring Custom Domain alongsideConsent Managementto ensure you are respectful of your end users’ consent preferences.
Segment offers two domain delegation solutions:Custom ProxyandCustom Domain. If you use Custom Domain, you can choose to use either DNS delegation or a Cannonical Name (CNAME). Segment recommends using Custom Domain with DNS delegation, which leads to easy setup, maintenance, and monitoring.
*If it’s not possible for you to delegate subdomains to Segment, you can use a CNAME instead. Segment encourages users to delegate a DNS subdomain rather than use use CNAME aliasing due to the evolving privacy standards in browsers, but CNAME aliasing remains an option for users not interested in using nameservers.
DNS subdomain delegation is a process where the control of a specific subdomain is assigned to another DNS server, allowing that server to manage the DNS records for the subdomain. This delegation is useful for distributing the management of DNS records and enables specialized handling of subdomain traffic.
When a user tries to access the alias domain, the DNS resolver looks up the CNAME record, finds the canonical name, and resolves it to the IP address of the target. For example, you could alias your subdomain to point to the Segment domain. If a user accesses your site, they are redirected to the Segment domain, but their browser’s address bar still shows the alias domain.
CNAME records provide flexibility and centralized management, making it easier to handle domain redirections and subdomain configurations.
Implementing a Custom Domain using CNAME delegation requires you to add a CNAME and record for two domains that Segment generates on your behalf: one for the Segment CDN and a second for the Tracking API. You must add a CNAME and DNS record for both domains.
Custom Domain supports the following sources:
Custom Domain configuration won’t disrupt your event tracking. Default Segment domains will continue to function alongside your custom domains once the setup is complete.
To configure Custom Domain:
Segment recommends creating a different subdomain (for example,mysubdomain.mydomain.com) for each source. You cannot connect multiple custom domains to the same source.
For initial setup, Segment requires anAnalytics.jssource. Custom Domain was largely developed to support JavaScript sources. It helps with comprehensive collection of first-party data from your website when accessed over any platform (desktop, mobile, and more). You can use the subdomain for all other non-JavaScript sources as well, for consistency, but it will have no impact on data collection for those sources.
For non-Analytics.js sources, you’ll need to update your implementation to use the subdomain as an endpoint when using the Tracking API. For example:
Server-side tracking is generally more reliable than client-side tracking. For example, when tracking data client-side, you might lose data when users might block all cookies or use tools that interfere with network requests leaving the browser.
For business-critical events, Segment recommends server-side data tracking. This approach means that your data is less susceptible to disruptions from client-side variables, which can result in more accurate and reliable tracking.
Yes, Custom Domain is a fully-managed solution. However, you must set up the following infrastructure on your end:
First, decide on your subdomain and then delegate it to Segment. Segment then asks you to add a DNS NS record to your DNS with specific values to complete the DNS delegation. From there on, Segment fully manages the infrastructure for serving Analytics.js and ingesting events data through the subdomain.
Segment doesn’t recommend that you change the subdomain after the initial setup. If you change the subdomain, Segment must revoke the older certificates for your subdomain and you are required to redo the entire onboarding process, as several underlying components, like certificates, would need to be recreated and reassociated.
Segment hosts and manages SSL Certificate on the Custom Domain. At this time, Segment does not support importing a certificate you may already have, as Segment must request a SSL certificate on your behalf using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) when initially setting up your Custom Domain.
Segment also uses ACM to manage and renew certificates.
Yes, Custom Domain allows Segment to renamewindow.analyticsto a unique name to avoid being blocked by some ad blocking software.
Customers who have access to the Custom Domain feature can rename analytics to<workspaceid>/<sourceid>.jsby choosing an Alias for Analytics.js within the source settings that are available after the workspace is enabled for Custom Domain.
Analytics.js cookies are not lost in the transition to Custom Domain. When users revisit your website, the previous Analytics.js cookies continue to be fetched and added to events, if available.
No, each workspace requires its own unique subdomain (for example,mysubdomain.mydomain.com).

Paragraphs:
On this page
Custom proxies allow you to proxy Analytics.js and all tracking event requests through your own domain.
You cannot use custom proxy setup for Analytics.js CDN or Tracking API with device-mode destinations because it requires that the destination’s native scripts are loaded onto the client, and the requests are sent directly to the destination.
Business Tier customers can also use Custom Domain
Custom Domain is a fully-managed service that enables you to configure a first-party subdomain over HTTPS to track event requests through your domain instead of tracking events through Segment’s default domain. For more information, see theCustom Domaindocumentation.
Segment offers two domain delegation solutions:Custom ProxyandCustom Domain. If you use Custom Domain, you can choose to use either DNS delegation or a Cannonical Name (CNAME). Segment recommends using Custom Domain with DNS delegation, which leads to easy setup, maintenance, and monitoring.
*If it’s not possible for you to delegate subdomains to Segment, you can use a CNAME instead. Segment encourages users to delegate a DNS subdomain rather than use use CNAME aliasing due to the evolving privacy standards in browsers, but CNAME aliasing remains an option for users not interested in using nameservers.
To set up a custom proxy, you need:
Custom Proxy Troubleshooting
If you experience issues configuring a custom proxy, contact your organization’s IT department for help. Segment does not have access to the resources you need to configure a custom proxy.
This guide explains how to set up a custom proxy in CloudFront. You can apply these principles to almost any modern CDN that supports proxies.
You need to set up two important parts, regardless of the CDN provider you use:
If you are using aRegional Workspace, please note that instead of usingapi.segment.ioto proxy the Tracking API, you’ll be usingevents.eu1.segmentapis.com
Segment only has the ability to enable the proxy setting for the Web (Analytics.js) source. Details for mobile source proxies are in theAnalytics-iOSandAnalytics-Androiddocumentation.  It is not currently possible to set up a proxy for server sources using the Segment UI.
Segment loads most integrations through the proxy, except for third-party SDKs
Third-party SDKs are loaded by a partner’s CDN, even with a Segment proxy configured. For example, if you have  a Segment custom proxy enabled and send data to a FullStory destination, FullStory’s CDN would load the FullStory SDK.
There are two options you can choose from when you set up your custom domain proxy.
Follow the directions listed forCloudFrontoruse your own CDN setup. Once you complete those steps and verify that your proxy works for bothcdn.segment.comandapi.segment.io,contact Segment Product Supportwith the following template email:
Double-check the Source URL and the Source ID.
A Segment Customer Success team member will respond that they have enabled this option for your account. When you receive this confirmation, open the source in your workspace, and navigate to Settings > Analytics.js. Update theHost Addresssetting fromapi.segment.io/v1to[your proxy host]/v1.
TheHost Addressfield does not appear in source settings until it’s enabled by Segment Customer Success.
There should be no downtime once the setup is complete, as the default Segment domains continue to work alongside the customer’s domains.
Follow these instructions after setting up a proxy such asCloudFront. Choose between thesnippet instructionsor thenpm instructions.
If you’ve followed the instructions above to have a Segment team member enable the apiHost settings in the UI, you can skip the instructions in this section.
If you’re a snippet user, modify theanalytics snippetlocated inside the<head>of your website:
To proxy CDN settings and destination requests that typically go tohttps://cdn.segment.com, replace:
To proxy API tracking calls that typically go toapi.segment.io/v1, replace:
If you’re using thenpm library, make the following changes directly in your code:
To proxy settings and destination requests that typically go tohttps://cdn.segment.comthrough a custom proxy:
To proxy tracking calls that typically go toapi.segment.io/v1, configure theintegrations['Segment.io'].apiHost:
These instructions refer to Amazon CloudFront, but apply more generally to other providers as well.
To set up your CDN Proxy:
Take note of the Domain Name for use in the next step.
To add a CNAME record for the Segment proxy to your organizations DNS settings:
As events travel through the proxy before reaching the tracking API, set up a proxy for the tracking API so that all calls proxy through your domain. To do this, set up a CloudFront distribution that’s similar to the one in the previous section, with the exception of the Origin Domain Name:
To add a CNAME record to your DNS settings:
These are some common issues that occur for customers implementing a custom proxy. This is not an exhaustive list, and these CloudFront or Cloudflare settings may change.
A 403 error can mean that you’ve misconfigured your Cloudflare CDN distribution. Try one of the following options to fix the error:
If you have a Cloudflare enterprise plan, create a Page Rule in Cloudflare so that Segment’s CDN doesn’t refuse the requests made through the Cloudflare Proxy. Ifcdn.segment.comis another CNAME that resolves toxxx.cloudfront.net, you will need to use a Page Rule in Cloudflare to override the host header to match the hostname for proxy requests. For more information about overriding the host header, see Cloudflare’sRewrite Host headersdocs.
For customers who are not on the Cloudflare Enterprise plan, use Cloudflare Workers. Workers usually run on the main domain (for example,www.domain.com), but if you want Workers to run on a subdomain, likehttp://segment.domain.com, you must record the subdomain in your DNS. For more information, see Cloudflare’sRoutes and domainsdocumentation.
When creating a Worker you can use this example provided by Cloudflare in theirBulk origin overridedocumentation with the origins set to:
In order to resolve a CORS OPTIONS pre-request fetch error, you must specify “Strict (SSL-Only Origin Pull)” as a Cloudflare Page rule for theapi.segment.ioproxy. Please see Cloudflare’sEncryption modesdocumentation for more details.
If your CloudFront Proxy is returing a 403 error, the following change in CloudFront might resolve the issue:
Alternatively, this setting may solve your issue:
To resolve a CORS issue, you might need to add a referrer header in the request you send to Segment. Follow AWS’sHow do I resolve the “No ‘Access-Control-Allow-Origin’ header is present on the requested resource” error from CloudFront?guide, which explains how to add a referrer header.
To reduce fetching assets from Segment’s CDN, you can bundle Analytics.js with your own code.
To bundle Analytics.js with your own code, you can:
Use Analytics.js as an npm package.
Use npm to install your destinations.
Hardcode your settings instead of fetching from the CDN (Segment doesn’t recommend this as it completely bypasses the Segment source GUI).
If you wish to restore the proxied API host to it’s original value:
Any changes made to the CDN host must be update manually in your code.

Visual Tagger entering maintenance mode
Visual Tagger is entering maintenance mode onApril 5th, 2021.
You can continue to use Visual Tagger with sources on which it’s already enabled. However, the feature will no longer be available to new Segment customers and existing customers will not be able to add new Visual Tagger sources.
Segment is committed to enabling customers to collect and deliver high quality customer data to the tools they need to run their businesses. As a CSS-based event tracking method, Visual Tagger has limitations that can prevent detailed data from being consistently collected. For code-based collection best practices, see theSegment Spec.
Going forward, support for the feature will include:
The following best practices can make your website more compatible with the feature and eliminate common issues:
Visual Tagger is a tool that enables you to collect data about what your customers are doing on your websites without having to write any code. Specifically, it helps you implementtrackevents by pointing and clicking on parts of your website.
With Visual Tagger, you can:
The Visual Tagger has two main views: theVisual Tagger Homeand theEvent Editor, which shows your website in an iframe.
Note: The website you’re tagging must include the Segment analytics.js snippet before you can use the Visual Tagger.
Get the following things set up before you use Visual Tagger:
Note: Your website must use HTTPS.
Once you have all the prerequisites set up, you’re ready to get started:
As you click each event, you’re prompted to select the part of the website that should trigger the event, and describe the properties that event should have.
You are now ready to tag events on your website!
Tip: If you ever need to get back to this screen, you can navigate to the JavaScript website source again, click theVisual taggertab, then clickAdd Event.
To create events, start in theEvent Editoron theBuildscreen. This page shows an iframe with your website.

You can either choose one of the Recommended Events, or you can clickAdd Eventand create a new one. Recommended Events work the same way, except Segment defines the Event Name, and each event comes with a set of default properties.
When you clickAdd Event, three types of events are available:
Button or Link Click. Select anybuttonandlinkelements on the page to create events that fire when a user clicks that button or link. Depending on the construction of your website, some elements that look like buttons might not actually be CSS “button” elements - use the “Any Element Click” event instead for these elements.
Form Submit. Select this option to highlight anyformelements on the page so you can select them. When you choose Form Submit, Segment adds all form fields to your event automatically asproperties.
Any Element Click. Selecting this option will allow you to click on any element on your page. This will allow you to create an event for whenever a user on your website clicks on that element.

Once you choose an event type, mouse over your website in the iframe to highlight elements that you can select to create an event, and click one to start the process.
If the element on the page has siblings, you can tag them all at the same time, or tag just the one specific element you clicked.
When you choose a Recommended Event, it works much in the same way, but the Event Name is pre-set and each event comes with a set of default properties.
The events you create are not saved until you publish them.
When you click on an element on your website, a window appears where you can enter the details for the event.
Event Name. Edit the event name to be simple yet descriptive.
Segment recommends that you use an “Object Action” format (for example,Blog Post Clicked, and use Title Case (capitalize the first letter of each word ) when naming events.
Once you’re satisfied with the event name and properties, clickAdd.
Tip! You can create more than one event before you move on to the next step.

When you use Visual Tagger, you can createstatic propertiesby entering the value that the property should have. When a property is static its value is hardcoded, and is always the same regardless of any actions from the user.
You can also createdynamic propertiesby selecting a piece of text from the website that you want as the value for that property. When a property is dynamic, its value is different depending on what the user clicked.
For example, if you run an e-commerce web shop and want to create an event that fires every time a user clicks on a product on your search results page, you would create aProduct Clickedevent.
To specify where the event was fired from, you would add a property calledlocationto the event. You would hardcode the value of that property as “Search Results Page”. This is an example of a static property.
To show which product the user clicked, you can add a property calledproduct_nameto the event. You can use the Visual Tagger “select from page” feature to select the text on the iframe-version of your website that gives the product name. The value of theproduct_nameproperty would then be different, depending on what users click.
When you tag a form you can track both that the usersubmittedthe form, and also update traits about the user.
This is useful if the form collects information about the user (such as Name, Email, Country). (This wouldn’t be useful on a Search or Add To Cart form.)
This is an illustration of how traits and events might appear for a user in a Destination or Engage.

If you enable the Identify Users feature, you can specify which traits to update in the same way as properties for the event.

By default, events created using the Visual Tagger only fire on the same URL as the one where you tagged the event. This prevents unexpected events if the same CSS selector exists on other pages of your site.
If you have similar pages with different URLs such as/products/1and/products/2and you want to same event to fire on both, you can change theURL Page Targetingto match/productsinstead of/products/1or any page on the entire website.
Once you finish filling out the event details, clickContinueto go to the Test and Publish screen. On this screen you can test your event to confirm that it works as expected before you publish it.
Test your events by clicking around on your website in the iframe, and doing things on the iframe-version of your site that should trigger the event.
If something doesn’t look right, clickBackto return to the Build screen and edit your tags.
If you’re having trouble validating your events, seeTroubleshooting Tips.
When you’ve finished setting up and testing your events, clickPublish.
Events can take up to 10 minutes appear on your website. Once they are live, events begin sending to Segment when people visit your website and interact with the elements that you created events for. The data from these events appears in the Website Source’s Debugger.
After you publish your event and wait for ~10 minutes, do a last test to make sure your tags are working expected and that you see your data landing in your Segment Debugger.
In one window, open up your website where you created the event. In another window (side by side), open theSegment Debuggerfor your JavaScript Source. The Debugger is a Segment tool that shows a live stream of the data coming from that Source.
Good to know: The Debugger automatically pauses after ~1 minute of idle time. Refresh the page if you leave and come back to it, and don’t see new data.
On your website, pretend that you are an end-user and try to trigger the event that you created in Visual Tagger. Watch the Debugger in the other window to confirm that the event fired when you took that action.
All events created using Visual Tagger automatically get a context property that says"visual_tagger" : trueso that you can distinguish between events that you implemented using Visual Tagger and events that you implemented using code.

Once you publish your events, they appear on theVisual Tagger Homeview in theAll Published Eventstable. From here, you can create clickAdd Eventto create new events, and edit or delete existing ones.

If your events are not working as expected, try the following steps to troubleshoot the issue.
Ensure that you toggle Visual Tagger integration on. You find it in the Settings for your Source.
Ensure that your website has analytics.js installed and running. You can confirm this by visiting your website and watching the Segment Debugger. Apagecall should flow into your Debugger whenever someone visits a page on your website if you have implemented analytics.js. Note that if you have an ad blocker enabled when you visit your website, data will not get fired into Segment when you interact with your website.
Confirm that the CSS selector has not changed in any way since you created the event in the Visual Tagger (for example, a button could change locations or be removed entirely). Because Visual Tagger relies on the CSS selector to tie events to user actions, if the CSS selector changes, the event stops sending. If this happens, edit the event in Visual Tagger and update the CSS selector. Segment does not have a way to alert you when events you created using Visual Tagger begin to fail.
Because Visual Tagger relies on stable CSS selectors to fire events, it is not compatible with websites that have CSS selectors that are dynamically generated on every page load.
If your website has any components in iframes (for example, if you embed Typeforms into your site), Visual Tagger cannot create events for those components. Segment recommends that you install analytics.js on the iframed-in site and use Visual Tagger directly on that site.
If you use the same name for multiple events (whether in code or using Visual Tagger), duplicate events arenotcreated downstream. Instead, Segment merges those events into one event.
If your events still don’t work as expected, contactSegment Customer Supportfor help.
Yes! Visual Tagger relies on CSS selectors, which involves “class names” such as “hero” or “footer”. Some web technologies automatically generate these names and change them on a regular basis, which makes the Visual Tagger events stop firing.
Squarespace uses this technique, and you can examine the HTML of your site to see if the “class names” are randomized letters/numbers.
Visual Tagger also does not support embedded elements, such as a YouTube video player or a Hubspot form.
When you load your website in the Visual tagger iframe, you might see unexpected or incorrect behavior. This is because browsers load websites differently inside aniframethan in a regular browser window.
For example, Google Chrome blocks certain types of cookies when a page is loaded inside an iframe, and this can cause problems with authentication or other functions.
Click theOpen in Popupbutton (above the top right corner of the iframed website) if you experience unexpected behavior when you load your website in the VT iframe, including issues with the login or authentication, or errors with form submissions. This opens the website in a new browser window (outside of an iframe) which is connected to the Visual Tagger.
Tip!: You might want to change the width of both the Visual tagger window and your website window so you can view them side by side for easier tagging.
The most stable way for Visual tagger to identify elements is if each one has a unique ID that persists even if the page is reorganized.
Visual Tagger is a great way to get started with tracking, but over time you might need to augment with coded instrumentation.
These are ideal use cases for Visual Tagger:
Understanding how users are engaging with your public website. Beyond page tracking, you can learn which CTA’s are most popular, collect information from forms, learn when users engage with interactive content like a carousel.
Similarly for campaign landing pages, that needs to go live with short turnaround, and require tracking forms, CTA, and other interactive content
Understanding your ecommerce funnel, how users browse and filter products, add them to cart before checking out and completing an order
Learn more about how users use your product or service, after logging in. Track key semantic events in your product such as Project Created (project management app), Account Upgraded, Listing Favorited (apartment rental site) etc to learn about adoption, engagement, and retention
These are examples of when to augment with coded instrumentation:
If your website or application changes frequently, you will need to keep track of each change and update Visual Tagger events accordingly. In that situation, it can be beneficial for the engineering team to have the event tracking in code and update at the same time as changing how a feature work.
The Visual Tagger integration has negligible impact to your site’s performance, because it installs a single event handler that makes an asynchronous call to Segment when a tag’s event is invoked.
However, adding a large number of tags to your site could potentially impact your site’s performance. To guard against this we limit the number of tags you can add using Visual Tagger to a maximum of 50.
Yes. You can track dynamically generated elements like modals (for example) using the Visual Tagger.
Visual Tagger binds its event listeners to thedocumentobject. Forms usingstopPropagationandstopImmediatePropagationmethods prevent the event from bubbling up, causing Visual Tagger to not execute the handlers for emitting track/identify calls. Remove anystopPropagationandstopImmediatePropagationmethod calls from your form handler to allow Visual Tagger to process the event.
Currently, only information that is visually present on the page is available for use in the Visual Tagger.
Events that were added using the Visual Tagger (as opposed to in code) have acontextproperty in the event payload that says"visual_tagger": true. Eventsnotimplemented using the Visual Tagger do not have this property.
Because the new version of Visual Tagger is available in the Segment app, Workspaces that have MFA or SSO enabled are able to access it.

Paragraphs:
On this page
Segment Business Tier customers can use Schema Controls to manage which events are allowed to pass through Segment and on to Destinations. These filters are a first-line defense to help you protect the integrity of your data, and the decisions made with it.
Blocking events within the source schema will exclude them from API and MTU calculations. These events are discarded before they reach the pipeline that Segment uses for MTU calculations.
The Schema tab shows the schema of events, properties, and traits for each source that Segment receives over a specific timeframe. It also shows when the events were last seen, how many events were allowed vs. blocked, and the downstream destinations those events are connected to.
You can view events by Segment call type in the Source Schema with theTrack,Identify, andGrouptabs. 
The Schema tracks:
Click the arrow to the left of the event name to view additional event properties for Page or Track events. Since the Schema tracks Identify traits, you will need to make sure you are passing traits into your Identify call in order to view event data in your schema.
The Schema shows “Page Viewed” for all Page calls under theTracktab.
The Source Schema UI changes slightly depending on whether you have aProtocols Tracking Planconnected to the source. If you have a Tracking Plan connected to your source, the UI displays aPlannedcolumn that will indicate if the event is planned or unplanned. This allows you to quickly identify unplanned events and take action to align your schema with your Tracking Plan. If there is no Tracking Plan connected to the source, the UI will display a toggle next to each event where, if you’re a Business Tier customer, you can simply block or allow that event at the source level.
Array properties are represented with an additional nested property representing the array’s items. The nested property is the property’s name with a.$suffix.
If an array property in the connected Tracking Plan does not include theitemsnested property, nested properties might be marked as unplanned in the Source Schema.
If you no longer want to track a specific event, you can either remove it from your code or, if you’re on the Business plan and don’t have a Tracking Plan connected, you can block track calls from the Segment UI. To do so, click on the Schema tab in a Source and toggle the event to enable or block an event.

For sources with a connected Tracking Plan, use Protocols to block unplanned events.
Once you block an event, Segment stops forwarding it to all of your Cloud and Device-mode Destinations, including your warehouses. You can remove the events from your code at your leisure. In addition to blocking track calls, Business plan customers can block all Page and Screen calls, as well as Identify traits and Group properties.
When an event is blocked, the name of the event or property is added to your Schema page with a counter to show how many events have been blocked. By default, data from blocked events and properties is not recoverable. You can always re-enable the event to continue sending it to downstream Destinations.
In most cases, blocking an event immediately stops that event from sending to Destinations. In rare cases, it can takeup to six hoursto fully block an event from delivering to all Destinations.
If you no longer want to capture specific traits within.identify()and.group()calls, you can either remove those traits from your code, or if you’re on the Business plan, you can block specific traits right from the Segment UI. To do so, click on the Schema tab in a Source and navigate to the Identify or Group events where you can block specific traits.

Blocked traits are not omitted from calls to device-mode Destinations.
All customers can filter specific events from being sent to specific Destinations (except for warehouses) by updating their tracking code. Here is an example showing how to send a single message only to Intercom and Google Analytics:
Destination flags are case sensitive and match theDestination’s name in the docs(for example, “AdLearn Open Platform”, “awe.sm”, “MailChimp”, and so on).
Segment Business tier customers can block track calls from delivering to specific Destinations in the Segment UI. Visit a Source Schema page and click on theIntegrationscolumn to view specific schema integration filters. Toggle the filter to block or enable an event to a Destination.

Paragraphs:
On this page
Once you have enabled destinations for a given source, all of thedatayou track will be routed to your connected tools and warehouses. If you no longer wish to send all data to a particular destination, you can disable the destination from the Source overview page.
Segment gives you the power to control exactly what data is allowed into your destinations, so you can protect the integrity of your data, and the decisions you make with it. You can send all of your data to a warehouse and only two specific events to an analytics tool. You can also block rogue events from all of your warehouses and end tools.
Anintegrations objectmay be passed in theoptionsofgroup,identify,pageandtrackmethods, allowing selective destination filtering. By default all destinations are enabled.
All customers can filter specific events from being sent to specific destinations (except for warehouses) by updating their tracking code. Here is an example showing how to send a single message only to Intercom and Google Analytics:
Destination flags arecase sensitiveand matchthe Destination’s name in the docs(for example, “AdLearn Open Platform”, “awe.sm”, “MailChimp”, etc.).
If you’re on Segment’s Business plan, you can filter track calls right from the Segment UI on your Source Schema page by clicking on the field in theIntegrationscolumn and then adjusting the toggle for each tool. Segment recommends using the UI if possible since it’s a much simpler way of managing your filters and can be updated with no code changes on your side.

If you no longer want to track an event, you can either remove it from your code or, if you’re on the Business plan, you can block track calls right from the Segment UI on your Source Schema page by adjusting the toggle for each event.

Once you block an event in Segment, Segment stops forwarding it to all of your destinations, including your warehouses. You can remove it from your code at your leisure. In addition to blocking track calls, Business plan customers can block all Page and Screen calls, as well as Identify traits and Group properties.
TheNew Eventbutton in your source schema adds the event to the source schema only. It does not add any events to your tracking code. If you want to track an event, you still need to manually add it to your source code.
A use case for this feature might be to enableschema filteringfor a new event before it arrives in the source to prevent it from reaching specific downstream destinations.
Segment allows users with Source Read-only permissions to download Source Schemas as a CSV file, maximizing portability and access to event data. You can download a copy of your schema by visiting the Source Schema page.
You can export Track, Identify, and Group Source Schemas.
You can only download one Source Schema CSV schema type (Track, Identify, or Group) per source at the same time.
To download a Source Schema CSV file:
All events and properties are now included in the CSV file
When you export a Source Schema, all events and properties are included in the CSV file regardless of the filters or search parameters currently applied to the Source Schema view.
You can view the Source Schema exports from the last 14 days on the Download History page.
To access the Download History page:
The Track event CSV file contains the following columns:
Labels in your exported CSV
If you uselabels, they appear as columns in your CSV. The column headers are keys, and the column data contains values.
The Identify and Group CSV files contain the following columns:
The exported schema doesn’t include actual values (for example, personal data) for the events, properties, and traits you are tracking for a specific source.

Get started with Segment
Crawling: https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/schema/schema-unique-limits/
Paragraphs:
While you can technically track unlimited events with Segment, only the first 4,000 events will be visible on the Schema page for a given Source. After you hit the 4,000 event limit, all future events will still be tracked and sent to your Destinations. They will not, however, be logged in the Segment Schema table.
While you can track unlimited event properties and traits with Segment, the Schema page has the following default limits:
After you hit the limit for both properties or traits, future properties and traits are still tracked and sent to your Destinations, but they won’t appear on the event details page. This limit includes nested properties in an event’s properties object.
These limits can also affect the traits and properties that you can see in the Computed Trait and Audience builder tools in Engage. If expected traits or properties do not appear in these tools, contact theSegment Support team.
If you hit any of the limits or would like to clear out old events or properties, you can clear the Schema data from your Source Settings. In your Source, navigate to Settings, then Schema Configuration. Scroll down to theClear Schema Historysetting.

Clearing events from the Source Schema only clears them from the Segment interface. It does not impact the data sent to your destinations or warehouses. Once you clear the events, the Schema page starts to repopulate new events.
You can archive events in order to declutter the Source Schema. If your Source Schema is connected to a Tracking Plan, events need to be blocked or unplanned for you to archive them. If your Source Schema not connected to a Tracking Plan, you must disable the event to see the archive button.
Archiving an event triggers an “Schema Event Archived” activity to the Audit Trail.
To view archived events, you can filter your view by “Archived”.
While this is particularly useful for Protocols customers that want to keep events “Unplanned yet acknowledged” and build a process to monitor for unplanned events, Protocols is not required to use this feature.
At this time, you cannot clear or archive old event properties individually. An alternative to this is to archive the event itself and then clear the archive. After you clear the archive, the event will re-populate in the schema with only the current properties.

Destinations are the business tools or apps that Segment forwards your data to. Adding Destinations allow you to act on your data and learn more about your customers in real time.
Destinations Catalog
If you want to explore the destinations compatible with Segment, check out theDestinations catalog. Select an item from the catalog to learn more about it. The documentation for each destination explains how the Segment Tracking API methods are implemented for that destination.
Segment hasSourcesandDestinations. Sources send dataintoSegment, while Destinations receive datafromSegment.
Segment has three destination connection types:
Event streams destinations are all destinations that aren’t storage or Reverse ETL destinations. Adding these destinations allow you to act on your data and learn more about your customers in real time. These includeDestination Actions.
Storage destinations enable you to store your raw Segment data. This enables data analysts and data scientists to work with the raw data to derive deeper and more customized insights to support your organization. Learn more from thestorage overview page.
Reverse ETLdestinations are the business tools or apps you use that Segment syncs the data from your warehouse to.
If your destination is not listed inthe Reverse ETL catalog, use theSegment Connections destinationto send data from your Reverse ETL warehouse to other destinations listed in thecatalog. The Segment Connections destination enables you to mold data extracted from your warehouse inSegment SpecAPI calls that are then processed bySegment’s HTTP Tracking API. The Segment HTTP Tracking API lets you record analytics data. The requests hit Segment’s servers, and then Segment routes your data to any destination you want. Get started with theSegment Connections destination.
Not all destinations can accept data from specific method types. To know if a destination can accept data from specific method types, look for theQuick Infobox at the top of the destination’s documentation page, or check out theDestinations Methods comparison chart.
Many destinations can accept data from all types of sources, but some are only compatible with specific source types (for example, web only, or server only). To find out which source types a specific destination can accept data from, check the documentation for that destination in theQuick infobox, or in theSupported Sources and Connection Modessection.
Wondering which destinations take which data? Check out the Destination connection modes list by category.
In June 2021, Segment released a new form of destinations calledDestinations Actions. These destinations allow users to createsubscriptions: sets of conditions in which data is sent to the destinations and data mappings, to format that data for the destination tool. Segment watches for data that matches the conditions you create (triggers) for the subscription, and when the conditions are met, uses an explicit mapping to transform the incoming data to an output format that your destination can use.
Segment’s web source (Analytics.js), and native client-side libraries (iOS, Android, React-native) allow you to choose how you send data to Segment from your website or app. There are two ways to send data:
Cloud-mode: The sources send data directly to the Segment servers, which then translate it for each connected downstream destination, and send it on. Translation is done on the Segment servers, keeping your page size, method count, and load time small.
Healthcare and Life Sciences (HLS) customers can encrypt data flowing into their destinations
HLS customers with a HIPAA eligible workspace can encrypt data in fields marked as Yellow in the Privacy Portal before they flow into an event stream, cloud-mode destination.To learn more about data encryption, see theHIPAA Eligible Segment documentation
Device-mode: You include additional code on your website or mobile app which allows Segment to use the data you collect on the device to make calls directly to the destination tool’s API, without sending it to the Segment serversfirst. (You still send your data to the Segment servers, but this occurs asynchronously.) This is also calledwrappingorbundling, and it might be required when the source has to be loaded on the page to work, or loaded directly on the device to function correctly. When you use Analytics.js, you can change the device-mode destinations that a specific source sends from within the Segment web app, without touching any code.

If you use Server source libraries, they only send data directly to Segment in Cloud-mode. Server library implementations operate in the server backend, and can't load additional destination SDKs.
Cloud-mode destinations send data through Segment. Device-mode destinations send data in parallel to Segment. There are tradeoffs between using cloud-mode and device-mode destinations. In general, Cloud-mode is preferred because you then benefit from Segment’s system features, like retries, Replay, Warehouses, Privacy blocking, filtering, and more.
You should consider using device-mode if you use destinations which record information directly on the user’s device. These types of tools might lose functionality if they aren’t loaded directly on the device.
Take a look at the pros and cons chart of device-mode and cloud-mode destinations to determine which connection mode is best for you:
Segment’s website sources use device-mode by default, because so many website-based destinations require that they be loaded on the page, and because size and page performance are less of a concern than on mobile. If your website source only collects information that you can instrument yourself, then you can use cloud-mode.
For example, a web-chat destination must be loaded to connect to the service and collect metrics efficiently - you don’t expect it to route chat messages through Segment! Thisdoesmean that Segment might not receive a small amount of the destination-specific information from your users. In the chat example, if the destination is calculating idle time between messages, that data would appear in the destination’s tooling, but not necessarily in the Segment data.
By default, destinations configured on a mobile source send their data directly to the Segment servers, then translate it and use Cloud-mode to forward it to destinations.Cloud-modemeans that Segment sends the data directly from the Segment servers, to their servers. This means you don’t need to package third-party SDKs for destinations that can accept cloud-mode data. Some primarily web-based destinations also allow cloud-mode, which can help reduce app size, and improve load time and performance. You can read more about theeffects of mobile app size on downloads in Segment’s blog.
Before you turn on or opt-in for cloud-mode for a mobile source, consider if your destinations have features that require interactions on the device or require device-specific data (see the examples above). For example, if you use cloud-mode for Mixpanel, you’ll get your data on reporting and people, but won’t be able to use their features for in-app surveys or auto-tracking. These can be really valuable, but might not be a priority for your team.
There are two main things Segment considers when deciding to use Device-mode or Cloud-mode, or both, for a destination partner:
The anonymous identifiers used on mobile devices are usually static, which means Segment doesn’t need to do additional resolution, and can build Cloud-mode destinations by default. Because Segment uses native advertising identifiers on mobile devices, you don’t need a full SDK on the device to reconcile or identify a user. For example, you might track users who viewed an advertisement in one app and installed another app as a result.
However, some mobile attribution tools do more advanced reconciliation based on more than the native identifier, which requires the SDK on the device to work properly. For those destinations, Segment offers device-mode, which packages the tool’s SDK with the client-side library so that you can get the entire range of tool functionality.
Cross-domain identity resolution for websites requires that the attribution tool use a third-party cookie so it can track a user anonymously across domains. This is a critical component of attribution modeling. As a matter of principle, Segment only uses first-party cookies and doesn’t share cookies with partners, so Analytics.js and the data it collects aren’t enough to generate view-through attribution in ad networks.
Customers can load their libraries and pixels in the context of the browser and trigger requests to attribution providers from their device in response to Segment API calls to take advantage of advertising and attribution tools.
Many of Segment’s destinations offer client-side features beyond data collection in their SDKs and libraries, for both mobile and web. In these cases, Segment offers Device-mode SDKs so that you can collect information on the device using Segment, but still get the destination’s complete native functionality.
Some features that usually require Device-mode include: automatic A/B testing, displaying user surveys, live chat or in-app notifications, touch and hover heatmapping, and accessing rich device data such as CPU usage, network data, or raised exceptions.
The first place to look is the individual destination documentation. Each one includes a matrix of supported Sources and Connection Modes. Segment provides a list ofall destinations and their connection modes.
In order to override the default, check the destination settings pane in the Segment web App either for aConnection Modetoggle or instructions on bundling any additional mobile components required.
Sync modes allow users to define how changes in the source should send downstream to your destination. Depending on which destinations you set up in Segment, you may need to choose a sync mode for your data. This configuration determines how Segment updates your destination based on the source data.
The available sync modes can vary based on the destination, integration type, and actions within the destination. For example, if you sync customer data, you might have the option to Insert, Update, or Upsert records.
Available sync modes include:
To add a Destination:
Learn moreabout what adding a destination entails.
Disabled destinations do not receive data
If you haven’t enabled your destination for the first time after you created it or if you actively disable a destination, Segment prevents any data from reaching the destination. Business Tier customers can requesta Replay, which resends data from the time the destination was disabled to the time it was re-enabled. Replays can also send data to currently disabled destinations.
Some destinations are not compatible with Replays after a certain period of time, for example, 14 days. Check with Segment’s support teamfriends@segment.comto confirm that your intended destination allows historical timestamps.
Segment increases deliverability to destinations usingretriesandreplays. Retries happen automatically for all customers, while replays are available on request forBusiness Tiercustomers.
Segment’s data flow is primarily unidirectional, from Segment to integrated destinations. Segment does not inherently support a bidirectional flow where events, once delivered and processed by a destination, are sent back to Segment.
Segment also usesbatchingto increase deliverability to your destinations. Some destinations have batching enabled by default, and some, like Segment’sWebhook (Actions) Destination, let you opt in to batching.
Some cases of event batching might lead to observability loss
While batching does increase event deliverability, you might experience error amplification, as if the entire batch fails, all events will be marked with the same status. For example, if a batch fails due to one429(Rate Limit) error, it might appear in the UI that there was one 429s request failure for each item in the batch.
Segment’s client libraries ensure delivery of your data to the API reliably in the face of spotty connections, device failure, or network partitions in your data centers.
When you use Segment’s mobile SDK, Segment dispatches each event to a background thread where the event is then written to a queue. Later, Segment’s SDK batches together many requests in to one compressed request and sends it to Segment’s servers. Segment’s SDKs minimize battery use and bandwidth use by powering up the radio less frequently and for shorter time periods.
If the delivery of the payload is not successfully sent due to connection issues, all of your SDKs will automatically retry the request until successful receipt of the payload according to the following policies. Note that retry policies are subject to change / tuning in the future.
All mobile libraries handle retries by periodically attempting to flush their internal queue of events to Segment. If the flush is unsuccessful, the library waits until the next regularly-scheduled flush time to try again. The background queue of requests to Segment is bounded in size so if events are being queued faster than we can successfully flush them to Segment, some events may be dropped.
The destination endpoint APIs have fluctuations in availability due to a number of issues ranging from network failures to bugs to overload. Segment’s internal systems retry failed destination API calls for four hours with a randomized exponential backoff after each attempt. This substantially improves delivery rates.
Here’s an example destination that was only successfully accepting 93.36% of all API requests but was achieving a 99.28% final deliverability rate due to Segment’s retry functionality.

You can see the current destination endpoint API success rates and final delivery rates for Segment’s server-side destinations on Segment’sstatus page.
Replay is available toBusiness tiercustomers.Contact Segmentto learn more.
Replaysallow customers to load historical data from Segment’s S3 logs into downstream destinations which accept cloud-mode data. So, for example, if you wanted to try out a new email or analytics tool, Segment can replay your historical data into that tool. This gives you a great testing environment and prevents data lock-in when vendors try to hold data hostage.
If you submittedsuppress_onlyrequests, Segment still retains historical events for those users, which can be replayed. If you do not want historical events replayed for suppressed users, submitsuppress_and_deleterequests instead.
Segment usesstream batchingfor all destinations that require near-realtime data andbulk batchingfor some data flows in our pipeline.
For all destinations, except for non-realtime Engage syncs and Reverse ETL syncs, Segment processes events from your source as they arrive and then flows the data downstream to your destinations in small batches, in a process calledstream batching. These batches might contain different events between retry attempts, as events in previous batches may have succeeded, failed with a permanent error, or expired. This variability reduces the workload the system processes during partial successes, allows for better per-event handling, and reduces the chance of load-related failures by using variable batch formations.
Some data flows may be able to use a process calledbulk batching, which supports batching for destinations that produce between several thousand and a million events at a time. Real-time workloads or using a Destination Insert Function may prevent bulk batches from being formed. Batches contain the same events between retries.
The following destinations support bulk batching:
You must manually configure bulk batches for Actions destinations
To support bulk batching for the Actions Webhook destination, you must setenable-batching: trueandbatch_size: >= 1000.
IP Allowlisting uses a NAT gateway to route traffic from Segment’s servers to your destination through a limited range of IP addresses, which can prevent malicious actors from establishing TCP and UDP connections with your integrations.
IP Allowlisting is available for customers on Business Tier plans.
Segment supports IP Allowlisting inall destinationsexcept for the following:
Destinations that are not supported receive traffic from randomly assigned IP addresses.
To enable IP Allowlisting for your workspace:
IP restriction might not be supported in all destinations.

Get started with Segment
Crawling: https://segment.com/docs/connections/destinations/actions/
Paragraphs:
Destination Actions are available for all Segment plans. Self-service plans are limited to two conditions per Trigger.See theavailable plans, orcontact Support.
On this page
The Destination Actions framework improves on classic destinations by enabling you to see and control how Segment sends the event data it receives from your sources, to actions-based destinations. Each Action in a destination lists the event data it requires, and the event data that is optional.
You can also choose which event types, event names, or event property values trigger an Action. These Triggers and mappings make it possible to send different versions of the Action, depending on the context from which it is triggered.
Each Actions-framework Destination you see in the Segment catalog represents a feature or capability of the destination which can consume data from your Segment source. The Action clearly lists which data from the events it requires, and which data is optional. For example, Amplitude requires that you always send aLogEvent, or Slack always requires aPostMessage.  Each Action also includes a default mapping which you can modify.
The following Actions-based Destinations are available:
A Destination Action contains a hierarchy of components, that work together to ensure the right data is sent to the destination.
For example, in the Amplitude (Actions) destination, you define your API and Secret keys in the destination’s global settings. Then, the provided Page Calls mapping:
To set up a new Actions-framework destination for the first time:
You must configure and enable at least one mapping to handle a connected source’s event(s) in an Actions-framework destination in order for data to send downstream. 
Events send downstream in the order in which they appear in the mappings UI. There is no mechanism through which you can control the order of events that send to the downstream destinations outside of that.
Moving from a classic destination to an actions-based destination is a manual process. Segment recommends that you follow the procedure below:
You can only migrate your destination filters using the Public API if you’re on the business tier plan. This functionality isn’t available in the Segment app.
To migrate your destination filters to your actions destination from the classic destination:
For a more comprehensive migration from a classic destination to an actions-based destination, follow the steps outlined below. This implementation strategy is only available for customers on a Segment Business Tier plan with access toDestination Filters. By adding additional line of defense with Destination Filters, you remove the possibility of duplicate events or dropped events and ensure that events sent before/after a specifiedreceived_attimestamp are sent to each destination.
This migration strategy involves configuring a destination filter on both the Classic destination and the Actions destination. Configure the classic destination filter to block events by thereceived_atfield with a certain value, and the Actions destination to drop events until thereceived_attimestamp field reaches that same value. Destination Filters within the UI have a limitation where they cannot access any top-level fields, but this is not a limitation forDestination Filterscreated by thePublic APIusingFQL. Because thereceived_atis a top-level field in the payload, you’ll need to create a destination filter with the Public API and submit the request with that FQL information described below.
By combining these Filters, Segment sends events through the Classic integration up until a specified time and then blocks events after that time. Then the Actions integration blocks events until that specified time, and only allows events beginning at that specified time.
The following code samples show you how you can create filters for your destinations using theCreate Filter for DestinationPublic API operation.
Endpoint:POSThttps://api.segmentapis.com/destination/classic_destination_id_from_url/filters
Endpoint:POSThttps://api.segmentapis.com/destination/actions_destination_id_from_url/filters
After configuring the Destination Filter on both the Classic and Actions destination, see each destination’s Filters tab and enable the filters. After completing the migration, you can disable the Classic destination on the Settings page, and remove each of the filters from both destinations.
You can add or remove, disable and re-enable, and rename individual actions from the Actions tab on the destination’s information page in the Segment app. Click an individual action to edit it.
From the edit screen you can change the action’s name and mapping, and toggle it on or off. SeeCustomizing mappingsfor more information.

When an Action is created, it’s disabled by default, to ensure that it’s only used after being fully configured. To begin sending data through an Action, enable it on the Actions page by selecting the toggle so that it appears blue.
If you find that you need to stop an action from running, but don’t want to delete it completely, you can click the action to select it, then click the toggle next to the action’s name to disable it. This takes effect within minutes, and disables the action until you reenable it.
To delete a destination action: click the action to select it, and clickDelete(the trash can icon).
This takes effect within minutes, and removes the action completely. Any data that would have gone to the destination is not delivered. Once deleted, the saved action cannot be restored.
To test a destination action, follow the instructions inTesting Connections. You must enable a mapping in order to test the destination. Otherwise, this error occurs:You may not have any subscriptions that match this event.
You can also test within the mapping itself. To test the mapping:
Test Mapping might not return the events you're looking for
Segment only surfaces a small subset of events for the Test Mapping feature and might not always return the event you’re looking for. If you’d like to test with a specific event, copy a specific event from yourSource Debuggerand paste it into theAdd test eventinterface.
If you use the default mappings for a destination action, you don’tneedto customize the mapping template for the action. You can edit the fields later if you find that the defaults no longer meet your needs.
Actions-based destinations have a limit of 50 individual mappings.
To create a custom destination action, start from the Actions tab.
If necessary, clickNew Mappingto create a new, blank action.
The required fields for a destination mapping appear automatically. Click the + sign to see optional fields.
Suggested mappings is fully available for RETL mappings, and is in public beta for event streams and connections.
Segment offers suggested mappings that automatically propose relevant destination fields for both model columns and payload elements. For example, if your model includes a column or payload field namedtransaction_amount, the feature might suggest mapping it to a destination field likeAmountorTransactionValue. This automation, powered by intelligent autocompletion, matches and identifies near-matching field names to streamline the setup. For more information, seeSegment’s suggested mappings blogpostand theSuggested Mappings Nutrition Label.
Review the suggested mappings for accuracy before finalizing them as the suggestions aren’t guaranteed to be 100% accurate.
The coalesce function takes a primary value and uses it if it is available. If the value isn’t available, the function uses the fallback value instead.
The replace function allows you to replace a string, integer, or boolean with a new value. You have the option to replace up to two values within a single field.
The flatten function allows you to flatten a nested object to an object with a depth of 1. Keys are delimited by the configured separator. For example, an object like {a: { b: { c: 1 }, d: 2 } } will be converted to { ‘a.b.c’: 1, ‘a.d’: 2 }.
Self-service users can add a maximum of two conditions per Trigger.
Mapping fields are case-sensitive. The following type filters and operators are available to help you build conditions:
Event property(is,is not,less than,less than or equal to,greater than,greater than or equal to,contains,does not contain,starts with,ends with,exists,does not exist).  Use these filters to trigger the action only when an event with a specific property occurs.
You can specify nested properties using dot notation, for examplecontext.app.name. If the property might appear in more than one format or location, you can use an ANY statement and add conditions for each of those formats. For example, you might filter for bothcontext.device.type = iosas well ascontext.os.name = "iPhone OS"Thedoesnot existoperator matches both anullvalue or a missing property.
The available operators depend on the property’s data type:
You can combine criteria in a single group usingALLorANY.  Use an ANY to “subscribe” to multiple conditions. Use ALL when you need to filter for very specific conditions. You can only create one group condition per destination action. You cannot created nested conditions.
Unsupported Special Characters
Mappings do not support the use of double quotes “ or a tilde ~ in the trigger fields. In mapping fields, the . character is not supported unless it’s being used to access an object key. If a string has a . in it, that is not supported.
Limitations
Mapping fields don’t support dot notation. For example, properties.amount.cost or properties_amount.cost aren’t supported.
Destination Filters
Destination filters are compatible with Destination Actions. Consider a Destination Filter when:
If your use case does not match these criteria, you might benefit from using Mapping-level Triggers to match only certain events.
You can use the Duplicate Mappings feature to create an exact copy of a mapping. The duplicated mapping has the same configurations and enrichments as your original mapping.
Duplicate Mappings supportsActions destinations,Reverse ETL destinations, and destinations connected to EngageAudiencesandJourneys.
To duplicate your mappings:
Segment creates a disabled mapping with the name “Original Mapping Name (Copy)”. You must enable the mapping for data to flow.
When you send an event with an actions destination Event Tester that doesn’t match the trigger of any configured and enabled mappings, you’ll see an error message that states,You may not have any subscriptions that match this event.To resolve the error, create a mapping with a trigger to handle the event being tested, or update the test event’s payload to match the trigger of any existing mappings.
If no mappings are enabled to trigger on an event that has been received from the connected source, the destination will not send any events. Ensure that at least one mapping has been configured and enabled in the destination mappings for an event that you would like to reach downstream.
Events without mappings enabled to handle them display as being discarded due to “No matching mapping” in a destination’s Delivery Overview.
When the same event triggers multiple mappings, a request will be generated for each mapping that’s configured to trigger on an event. For example, for theSubscription Updatedevent, if two mappings are enabled and both have conditions defined to trigger on theSubscription Updatedevent, the two requests will be generated and sent to the destination for eachSubscription Updatedevent.
Access Tokens that were generated from initial authorization, for example, when you connect a destination via Oauth, are always short-lived. Commonly, the token remains valid for 30 minutes to 1 hour. When Segment receives 401 error responses from the destination after a token has expired, it will automatically make another request to the destination for a new token and will then retry the event. Therefore, 401 responses are sometimes expected and do not indicate an event failure. There are three event flows when events are received and sent to a destination:
The underlying systems for these flows have their own copy of the token, which can expire at different points in time.
Threfore, if you see a 401 error in a sample response, it is likely that you’ll also see another request was made after it, to ask the downstream destination for a new token. Then one more request was made to actually send the data in your payload to the downstream destination.
Segment integrations process events through mappings individially. This means that no context is held that would allow you to map a value from one event to the field of a subsequent event. Each event itself must contain all of the data you’d like to send downstream in regards to it. For example, you cannot sendemailin on an Identify call and then access that sameemailfield on a Track call that comes in later if that Track call doesn’t also haveemailset on it.
This issue can occur due to a browser cache conflict or if an event property name includes a/. To resolve it, try clearing your browser cache or accessing the mapping page in an incognito window. Additionally, check if the mapped property name contains a/. If it does, rename the property to remove the/and update the mapping.

Get started with Segment
Crawling: https://segment.com/docs/connections/destinations/add-destination/
Paragraphs:
On this page
You’ve decided how to format your data, and collected it usingSegment Sources. Now what do you do with it? You send the data to Destinations.
Destinations are tools or services which can use the data sent from Segment to power analytics, marketing, customer outreach, and more.
Each Segment Workspace has its own set of destinations, which are connected to the workspace’s sources. When you add or modify a destination, make sure you’re working with the correct workspace.
Healthcare and Life Sciences (HLS) customers can encrypt data flowing into their destinations
HLS customers with a HIPAA eligible workspace can encrypt data in fields marked as Yellow in the Privacy Portal before they flow into an event stream, cloud-mode destination.
To learn more about data encryption, see theHIPAA Eligible Segment documentation.
There are two ways to add a destination to your deployment: using the Segment web app, or using thePublic API.
Some third-party tools (such as Customer.io, Leanplum, and Airship) can both consume Segment data (as destinations), and send their data to Segment Warehouses asCloud-Sources. When you add a destination, make sure you’re viewing the Destinations tab in the catalog so you add the correct one.
If you have more than one instance of the same destination, you can clickCopy Settings From Other Destinationto save yourself time entering the settings values manually.
You can also add a destination directly from the source’s settings page in the Segment web app.
You can use the Segment Public API to add destinations to your workspace using theCreate Destination endpoint. The API requires an authorization token, and uses thenamefield as a namespace that defines whichsourcethe destination is connected to. You send the rest of the destination’s configuration as a JSON blob. View the documentation page in the Segment Catalog, or query theSegment Catalog API, for a destination to see the available settings.
You must use an authorization token to access the Public API, and these tokens are tied to specific workspaces. If you use the Public API to access multiple workspaces, make sure you’re using the token for the workspace you want to access before proceeding.
Adding a destination can have a few different effects, depending on which sources you set up to collect your data, and how you configured them.
If you are usingSegment’s JavaScript library, Analytics.js, then Segment handles any configuration changes you need for you. If you’re using Analytics.js in cloud-mode, the library sends its tracking data to the Segment servers, which route it to your destinations. When you change which destinations you send data to, the Segment servers automatically add that destination to the distribution list.
If you’re using Analytics.js in device-mode, then Analytics.js serves as a wrapper around additional code used by the individual destinations to run on the user’s device. When you add a destination, the Segment servers update a list of destinations that the library queries. When a user next loads your site, Analytics.js checks the list of destinations to load code for, and adds the new destination’s code to what it loads. It can take up to 30 minutes for the list to update, due to CDN caching.
You can enable device-mode for some destinations from the destination’s Settings page in the Segment web app. You don’t need to use the same mode for all destinations in a workspace; some can use device-mode, and some can use cloud-mode.
By default, Segment’smobile sourcessend data to Segment in cloud-mode to help minimize the size of your apps. In cloud-mode the mobile source libraries forward the tracking data to the Segment servers, which route the data to the destinations. Since the Segment servers know which destinations you’re using, you don’t need to take any action to add destinations to mobile apps using cloud-mode.
However, if the destination you’re adding has features that run on the user’s device, you might need to update the app to package that destination’s SDK with the library. Some destinations require that you package the SDK, and some only offer it
Segment’sserver sourcesrun on your internal app code, and never have access to the user’s device. They run in cloud-mode only, and forward their tracking calls to the Segment servers, which forward the data to any destinations you enabled.
When you add a destination in Segment, you must tell Segment how to connect with that destination’s app or endpoints. Most destinations offer an API token or authentication code which you can get from their web app. The documentation for each Segment destination includes information about what you need, and how to find it. Copy this information, and paste it into the Settings for the destination, or include it in thecreate API call.
Each destination can also have destination settings. These control how Segment transforms the data you send to the destination, and can be used to adapt it to your configuration or enable or disable certain destination features.
Multiple-destination support is available for all Segment customers on all plan tiers.
Segment allows you to connect a source to multiple instances of a destination. You can use this to set up a single Segment source that sends data into different instances of your analytics and other tools.
For example, you might set up a single Segment source to send data both to separate instances of Google Analytics for each business unit in your organization, and to another instance for executive-level reporting. You could also use this to make sure that tooling instances for different geographic teams are populated with the same data from the same source.
You can also connect multiple instances of a destination to help you smoothly migrate from one configuration to another. By sending each version the same data, you can check and validate the new configuration without interrupting use of the old one.
However, there are a few considerations:
Device-mode destinations do not support connecting multiple instances of the destination to the same source. If you try to a connect an additional instance of a device-mode destination to your source, the option to add a second instance does not appear.
Mobile sources, and the legacy Project source, can connect to multiple instances of destinations that operate only in cloud-mode. Mobile and Project sources cannot connect to multiple instances of destinations that operate in both cloud-mode and device-mode. Non-mobile sources can only connect toonedevice-mode instance of a destination.
Multi-instance support is not available for most hybrid Actions destinations or Web mode Actions destinations.
Segment does not support connecting a single source to multiple instances of aData Lakesdestination.
Non-mobile sources can only connect to _one_ device-mode instance of a destination
You cannot connect a source to more than one instance of a destination that operates only in device-mode. For more information about device-mode restrictions, see theSending Segment data to Destinationsdocumentation.
If your organization is on a Segment Business tier plan, you can useReplayto send historical data to new instances of a destination.
To connect a source to more than one instance of a destination in the Segment web app, start by adding the first instance of the destination and giving it a unique name,as described above. To add another instance of the destination, follow either of those two methods and choose another unique name.
You must give each instance of the destination connected to the same source a unique name. Segment recommends that you use descriptive names rather than numbers, so other Segment users can understand which Segment destinations are linked to which tool instances. For example, you might use “Amplitude North America” and “Amplitude South America”, instead of “Amplitude 1” and “Amplitude 2”. You can edit the destination instance name at any time.
If you added the first instance of your destination before multi-instance destinations became available, that instance is automatically named for the destination with no other identifiers, for example “Amplitude”.
Some destinations do not support having multiple instances connected to the same source. In that case, the option to add a second instance of that destination does not appear.
You can create unique destination filters for each destination instance connected to the same source.
Some destinations don’t support multiple instances connected to the same source. If this is the case, you won’t see the option to add a second instance of that destination.
It is not possible to connect multiple instances of one source (for example, two website sources) to the same destination. However, you can create another instance of the destination for the other sources, and clickCopy Settings From Other Destinationto save yourself time entering the settings values again.
You can add multiple instances of a destination using the Segment Public API. See the Segment ConfigAPI documentation. If a destination does not support multi-instance, the Public API throws an appropriate error.
Multiple Data Lakes:Segment does not currently support connecting a single source to multiple instances of a data lakes destination.Contact Segment Customer Successif this would be useful for your organization.
Protocols transformations and multi-instance support:Protocols transformations are specific to each source, and operate the same on all instances of a specific destination. Segment does not currently support creating unique protocols transformations for each instance of a destination.
Integrations object considerations:A common part of a Segment message isthe integrations object, which you can use to explicitly filter to which destinations the call is forwarded, as well as to specify options for different destination tools. If you use the integrations object to filter events or to send destination-specific options, Segment applies its values to all instances. For example:

Paragraphs:
On this page
Destination filters are only available to Business Tier customers.
Use destination filters to prevent certain data from flowing into a destination. You can conditionally filter out event properties, traits, and fields, or even filter out the event itself.
You can configure destination filters on cloud-mode, mobile cloud-mode destinations, and web device-mode and actions-based destinations.  With device-mode destinations, you can use the same user interface or API mechanism that you use for your cloud-mode destinations, and have those filters acted upon for device-mode destinations on web.
Common use cases for destination filters include:
Keep the following limitations in mind when you use destination filters:
Contact Segmentif these limitations impact your use case.
To create a destination filter:
Enable destination filters for Analytics.js sources
If you are currently using Analytics.js as your source and want to apply filters to device-mode destinations, you need to enable device mode destination filters for your Analytics.js source. To do this, go to your Javascript source, navigate to Settings > Analytics.js, and turn on the toggle forDestination Filters. This will ensure the filters are effectively applied to device-mode destinations.
The destination filters API provides more power than Segment’s dashboard destination filters settings. With the API, you can create complex filters that are conditionally applied using Segment’sFilter Query Language (FQL).
The destination filters API offers four different filter types:
To learn more, read Segment’sDestination Filters API docs.
The following examples illustrate common destinations filters use cases:
Example: Remove email addresses fromcontextandproperties:
Property-level allowlisting is available with Segment’s API. Using destination filters, you can configure a rule that removes email addresses fromcontextandproperties. As a result, Segment only sends traits without PII to the destination.

Healthcare and Life Sciences (HLS) customers can encrypt data flowing into their destinations
HLS customers with a HIPAA eligible workspace can encrypt data in fields marked as Yellow in the Privacy Portal before they flow into an event stream, cloud-mode destination.
To learn more about data encryption, see theHIPAA Eligible Segment documentation.
This example shows a filter that controls event volume by only sendingUser Signed UpandDemo Requestedevents.

This example shows a rule that only sends track calls to Google Analytics.

In the example below, the rule targets email addresses with internal domains to stop test events from reaching Destinations.

In the example below, the rule prevents an event from sending ifOrder Completedandproperties.emailcontain an internal@segment.comemail address.

Using thedestination filters API, you can create a rule to randomly sample video heartbeat events.
Watch this destination filters walkthroughto learn how to use event names to filter events sent to destinations.
Use thePublic APIto only send events to your destination if they contain auserId. Here’s an example of how you might format this request:
There are certain destinations to which you may not want to send theuserId. To accomplish this, you can use thePublic APIto create a Filter that will target and remove theuserId(or any other top-level field) like this:
Some destinations offer settings that also allow you to filter data. For example, the Facebook App Events destination allows you to mapScreenevents toTrackevents. Because destination filters are evaluated and appliedbeforethe destination settings are applied, they can conflict with your settings.
For example, if you have a destination filter that filters Track eventsandyou have theUse Screen Events as Track Eventssetting enabled,Trackevents drop, butScreenevents still process. The destination settings transform it into aTrackevent -afterthe filters.
Segment makes effort to ensure that destination filters can handle unexpected situations. For example, if you use thecontains()FQL function on thenullfield, Segment returnsfalseinstead of returning an error. If Segment can’t infer your intent, Segment logs an internal error and drops the event. Segment defaults to this behavior to prevent sensitive information, like a PII filter, from getting through.
Errors aren’t exposed in your Destination’s Event Deliverability tab. For help diagnosing missing destination filter events,contact Segment.
Destination filters can filter properties out of objects nested in an array. For example, you can filter out thepriceproperty of every object in an array atproperties.products. You can also filter out an entire array from the payload. However, you can’t drop nested objects in an array or filter properties out of a single object in an array.
To block a specific property from all of the objects within a properties array, set the filter using the following the format:<propertyType>.<arrayName>.<arrayElementLabel>​.
For example, theproperties.products.newElementfilter blocks allnewElementproperty fields from eachproductsobject of an array within thepropertiesobject of a Track event.

To block the Identify event traitproducts.newElement, select the option under theUser Traitslist instead. To block the context object fieldproducts.newElement, select it from theContext Fieldslist.
Segment supports 10 filters per destination. If you need help consolidating filters or would like to discuss your use case,contact Segment.
Segment evaluates multipleOnly Sendfilters against each other and resolves destination filters in order. If multipleOnly Sendfilters conflict with each other, Segment won’t send information downstream.
Segment displays the most recent 15,000 properties. To find a property not in the filter dropdown, enter the property manually.
To filter out events from warehouses, use Selective Sync.
Generally, only Track calls havenameproperties, which correspond to theeventfield in an event.
The Activity Feed shows the action, date, and user who performed the action when a destination filter is created, modified, enabled, disabled, or deleted. You can also subscribe to notifications for any of these changes in theActivity Feedsettings page.
You must have write access to save and edit filters. Read permission access only allows viewing and testing access.
Use the destination filter tester during setup to verify that you’re filtering out the right events. Filtered events show up on the schema page but aren’t counted in event deliverability graphs.
Destination Filters can’t target properties or traits with spaces in the field name. As an alternative, useInsert Functions, which let you write code to take care of such filtering.
The check for unsupported events types happens before any destination filter checks. As a result, Destination Filters can’t prevent unsupported event type errors. To filter these events, use theIntegrations Object.
Destination filters only filter events sent after filter setup. If you just added a destination filter but still see some events going through, you’re likely seeing retries from failed events that occurred before you set up the filter.
When Segment sends an event to a destination but encounters a timeout error, it attempts to send the event again. As a result, if you add a destination filter while Segment is trying to send a failed event, these retries could filter through, since they reflect events that occurred before filter setup.
Destination filters are case-sensitive. Make sure to test your filter conditions with a test event before saving and enabling the filter.

Paragraphs:
On this page
There are four components to Reverse ETL: Sources, Models, Destinations, and Mappings.

Follow these 4 steps to set up Reverse ETL:
In Reverse ETL, a source is your data warehouse.
You need to be a user that has both read and write access to the warehouse.
To add your warehouse as a source:
Models define sets of data you want to sync to your Reverse ETL destinations. A source can have multiple models. Segment supportsSQL modelsanddbt models.
Use Segment’s dbt extension to centralize model management and versioning. Users who set up a BigQuery, Databricks, Postgres, Redshift, or Snowflake source can use Segment’sdbt extensionto centralize model management and versioning, reduce redundancies, and run CI checks to prevent breaking changes.
If you use dbt Cloud with Reverse ETL, you cancreate up to 5 mappingsthat use the sync strategydbt Cloud, which extracts data from your warehouse and syncs it with your destination after a job in dbt Cloud is complete.
In Reverse ETL, destinations are the business tools or apps you use that Segment syncs the data from your warehouse to. A model can have multiple destinations.
Reverse ETL supports the destinations in theReverse ETL catalog. If the destination you want to send data to is not listed in the Reverse ETL catalog, use theSegment Connections Destinationto send data from your Reverse ETL warehouse to your destination.
Engage users can use theSegment Profiles Destinationto create and updateProfilesthat can then be accessed throughProfile APIand activated withinTwilio Engage.
Separate endpoints and credentials required to set up third party destinations
Before you begin setting up your destinations, note that each destination has different authentication requirements. See the documentation for your intended destination for more details.
To add your first destination:
Mappings enable you to map the data you extract from your warehouse to the fields in your destination. A destination can have multiple mappings.
To create a mapping:
Use Segment’sDuplicate mappingsfeature to create an exact copy of an existing mapping. The copied mapping has the same configurations and enrichments as your original mapping.
When you set up destination actions in Reverse ETL, depending on the destination, somemapping fieldsmay require data as anobjectorarray.
You can send data to a mapping field that requires object data. An example of object mapping is anOrder completedmodel with aProductscolumn that’s in object format.
Example:
To send data to a mapping field that requires object data, you can choose between these two options:
Certain object mapping fields have a fixed list of properties they can accept. If the names of the nested properties in your object don’t match with the destination properties, the data won’t send. Segment recommends you to useCustomize Objectto ensure your mapping is successful.
To send data to a mapping field that requires array data, the model must provide data in the format of an array of objects. An example is anOrder completedmodel with aProduct purchasedcolumn that’s in an array format.
Example:
To send data to a mapping field that requires array data, you can choose between these two options:
Certain array mapping fields have a fixed list of properties they can accept. If the names of the nested properties in your array don’t match the destination properties, the data won’t send. Segment recommends you to use theCustomize arrayoption to ensure your mapping is successful.
Objects in an array don’t need to have the same properties. If a user selects a missing property in the input object for a mapping field, the output object will miss the property.
You can choose to exclude null values from optional mapping fields in your syncs to some destinations. Excluding null values helps you maintain data integrity in your downstream destinations, as syncing a null value for an optional field may overwrite an existing value in your downstream tool.
For example, if you opt to sync null values with your destination and an end user fills out a form but chooses to leave an optional telephone number field blank, the existing telephone number you have on file in your destination could be overwritten with the null value. By opting out of null values for your downstream destination, you would preserve the existing telephone number in your destination.
By default, Segment syncs null values from mapped fields to your downstream destinations. Some destinations do not allow the syncing of null values, and will reject requests that contain them. Segment disables the option to opt out of syncing null values for these destinations.
To opt out of including null values in your downstream syncs:
After you’ve set up your source, model, destination, and mappings for Reverse ETL, your data will extract and sync to your destination(s) right away if you chose an interval schedule. If you set your data to extract at a specific day and time, the extraction will take place then.
To edit your model:
Suggested mappings is fully available for RETL mappings.
Segment offers suggested mappings that automatically propose relevant destination fields for model columns and payload elements. For example, if your model includes a column or payload field namedtransaction_amount, the feature might suggest mapping it to a destination field likeAmountorTransactionValue. This automation, powered by intelligent autocompletion, matches and identifies near-matching field names to streamline the mappings setup process. For more information, seeSegment’s suggested mappings blog postand theSuggested Mappings Nutrition Facts Label.
Review the suggested mappings for accuracy before finalizing them, as Segment can’t guarantee all of the suggested mappings are accurate.
To edit your mapping:

The Reverse ETL sync overview tab, located underConnections > Destinations, gives you an overview of your latest Reverse ETL syncs.

You can view the following information about each sync:

To check the status of your extractions:
Automatic retry handling might not yet be available in your workspace
To ensure overall system stability and performance, Segment is releasing automatic retry handling to all workspaces in a phased rollout program. Segment expects this feature to be available to all customers by January 31, 2025.
Segment automatically retries events that were extracted from your data warehouse but failed to load for up to 14 days or 5 syncs following a partially successful sync or a sync failure.
Segment checks for the latest changes in your data before loading the failed records on a subsequent (automatically scheduled or manually triggered) sync to ensure the data loaded into Segment isn’t stale and only the latest version of the data is loaded to destination. If the error causing the load failure is coming from an upstream tool, you can fix the error in the upstream tool to resolve the load error on a subsequent sync.
Syncs with intervals less than or equal to two hours may not see failed events on the sync immediately following failed record
Syncs with intervals less than or equal to two hours may not see failed events right away, as Segment’s internal systems take up to two hours to retry events that initially failed.
Reverse ETL uses the Unique Identifier column to detect data changes, like new, updated, and deleted records. If you encounter an error, you can reset Segment’s tracking of this column and force Segment to manually add all records from your dataset.
To reset a sync:
You can cancel syncs when your sync is currently running during the extraction and load phase.
To cancel a sync:
Your canceled syncs with have a status asCanceled,and any syncs that are in the process of being canceled will have a status ofCanceling.
Once you cancel a sync, the record count underExtraction Resultsreflects the records already processed. These records won’t be included in future syncs. To reprocess these records, you can reset or replay the sync.
You can choose to replay syncs. To replay a specific sync, contactfriends@segment.com. Keep in mind that triggering a replay resyncs all records for a given sync.
You can opt in to receive email, Slack, and in-app alerts about Reverse ETL sync failures and fluctuations in the volume of events successfully delivered to your mapping.
The notification channels that you select for one alert will apply to all alerts in your workspace.
To subscribe to alerts for a failed or partially successful sync:
If you opted to receive notifications by email, you can clickView active email addressesto see the email addresses that are currently signed up to receive notifications.
You can create an alert that notifies you when the volume of events successfully received by your mapping in the last 24 hours falls below a percentage you set. For example, if you set a percentage of 99%, Segment notifies you if your destination had a successful delivery rate of 98% or below.
To receive a successful delivery rate fluctuation alert in a Slack channel, you must first create a Slack webhook. For more information about Slack webhooks, see Slack’sSending messages using incoming webhooksdocumentation.

To subscribe to alerts for successful delivery fluctuations at the mapping level:
To edit or disable your alert, navigate to your mapping’s Alerts tab and select the Actions menu for the alert you’d like to edit.

Paragraphs:
On this page
View reference information about how Segment detects data changes in your warehouse and the rate and usage limits associated with Reverse ETL.
Reverse ETL computes the incremental changes to your data directly within your data warehouse. The Unique Identifier column is used to detect the data changes, such as new, updated, and deleted records.
Delete Records Payload
The only value passed for deleted records is their unique ID, which can be accessed as__segment_id. As of September 24, 2024, deleted records also contain all columns selected by your model, withnullvalues in place of data.
For Segment to compute the data changes within your warehouse, Segment needs to have both read and write permissions to the warehouse schema table. At a high level, the extract process requires read permissions for the query being executed. Segment keeps track of changes to the query results through tables that Segment manages in a dedicated schema (for example,_segment_reverse_etl), which requires some write permissions.
There may be cost implications to having Segment query your warehouse tables.
To provide consistent performance and reliability at scale, Segment enforces default use and rate limits for Reverse ETL.
Reverse ETL usage limits are measured based on the number of records processed to each destination – this includes both successful and failed records. For example, if you processed 50K records to Braze and 50K records to Mixpanel, then your total Reverse ETL usage is 100K records.
Processed records represents the number of records Segment attempts to send to each destination. Keep in mind that not all processed records are successfully delivered, for example, such as when the destination experiences an issue.
Your plan determines how many Reverse ETL records you can process in one monthly billing cycle. When your limit is reached before the end of your billing period, your syncs will pause and then resume on your next billing cycle. To see how many records you’ve processed using Reverse ETL, navigate toSettings > Usage & billingand select theReverse ETLtab.
If you have a non-standard or high volume usage plan, you may have unique Reverse ETL limits or custom pricing. To see your Reverse ETL limits in the Segment app, selectSettings > Usage & Billing.
The extract phase is the time spent connecting to your database, executing the model query, updating internal state tables and staging the extracted records for loading.
*:If Segment identifies a sync would be larger than 150 million records, Segment extracts 150 million of the records in the initial sync and syncs any additional records during the next scheduled or manual sync.
For example, if a sync would contain 700 million records, Segment would run an initial 150 million record sync, and during the next three scheduled or manual syncs, would sync 150 million records. The fifth scheduled or manual sync would contain the remaining 100 million records.

Set up Azure as your Reverse ETL source.
At a high level, when you set up Azure dedicated SQL pools for Reverse ETL, the configured user needs read permissions for any resources (databases, schemas, tables) the query needs to access. Segment keeps track of changes to your query results with a managed schema (__SEGMENT_REVERSE_ETL), which requires the configured user to allow write permissions for that schema.
Make sure the user you use to connect to Segment has permissions to use that warehouse. You can follow the process below to set up a new user with sufficient permissions for Segment’s use.
To create a login in your master database, run:
Execute the commands below in the database where your data resides.

To set up your BigQuery source with Reverse ETL, you mustconstruct a BigQuery role and service accountandcreate a BigQuery source in the Segment app.
BigQuery Reverse ETL sources support Segment's dbt extension
If you have an existing dbt account with a Git repository, you can useSegment’s dbt extensionto centralize model management and versioning, reduce redundancies, and run CI checks to prevent breaking changes.
You need to be an account admin to set up the Segment BigQuery connector as well as write permissions for the__segment_reverse_etldataset.
There are two approaches you can take when granting Segment access to your BigQuery resources:
You can choose the approach that best suits your needs.
With this approach, use BigQuery predefined roles to create a service account for Segment to assume.
Enter yourService account nameand a description of what the service account will do.
With this approach, you can set up a custom role with the following permissions:
When connecting your BigQuery warehouse to Segment, you’ll need to know the location of your resources.
You can find the location of your BigQuery resources using the following method:

Set up Databricks as your Reverse ETL source.
At a high level, when you set up Databricks for Reverse ETL, the configured service-principal needs read permissions for any resources (databases, schemas, tables) the query needs to access. Segment keeps track of changes to your query results with a managed schema (__SEGMENT_REVERSE_ETL), which requires the configured service-principal to allow write permissions for that schema. Segment supports only OAuth (M2M) authentication. To generate a client ID and Secret, follow the steps listed in Databricks’OAuth machine-to-machine (M2M) authenticationdocumentation.
Databricks Reverse ETL sources support Segment's dbt extension
If you have an existing dbt account with a Git repository, you can useSegment’s dbt extensionto centralize model management and versioning, reduce redundancies, and run CI checks to prevent breaking changes.
Make sure the service principal you use to connect to Segment has permissions to use that warehouse. In the Databricks console go toSQL warehousesand select the warehouse you’re using. Navigate toOverview > Permissionsand make sure the service principal you use to connect to Segment hascan usepermissions.

Set up Snowflake as your Reverse ETL source.
At a high level, when you set up Snowflake for Reverse ETL, the configured user/role needs read permissions for any resources (databases, schemas, tables) the query needs to access. Segment keeps track of changes to your query results with a managed schema(__SEGMENT_REVERSE_ETL), which requires the configured user to allow write permissions for that schema.
Segment now supports key-pair authentication for Snowflake Reverse ETL sources. Key-pair authentication is available for Business Tier users only.
Snowflake Reverse ETL sources support Segment's dbt extension
If you have an existing dbt account with a Git repository, you can useSegment’s dbt extensionto centralize model management and versioning, reduce redundancies, and run CI checks to prevent breaking changes.
Follow the instructions below to set up the Segment Snowflake connector. Segment recommends you use theACCOUNTADMINrole to execute all the commands below, and that you create a user that authenticates with an encrypted key pair.
Segment has a Terraform provider, powered by the Public API, that you can use to create a Snowflake Reverse ETL source. See thesegment_source (Resource)documentation for more information.
Enter and run the code below to create a database.
Segment uses the database specified in your connection settings to create a schema called__segment_reverse_etlto avoid collision with your data. The schema is used for tracking changes to your model query results between syncs.
An existing database can be reused, if desired. Segment recommends you to use the same database across all your models attached to this source to keep all the state tracking tables in 1 place.
Enter and run the code below to create a virtual warehouse.
Segment Reverse ETL needs to execute queries on your Snowflake account, which requires a Virtual Warehouse to handle the compute. You can also reuse an existing warehouse.
Enter and run the code below to create specific roles for Reverse ETL.
All Snowflake access is specified through roles, which are then assigned to the user you’ll create later.
Enter and run one of the following code snippets below to create the user Segment uses to run queries. For added security, Segment recommends creating a user that authenticates using a key pair.
To create a user that authenticates with a key pair,create a key pairand then execute the following SQL commands:
To create a user that authenticates with a password, execute the following SQL commands:
Learn more about the Snowflake Account ID in Snowflake’sAccount identifiersdocumentation.
After you’ve successfully added your Snowflake source,add a modeland follow the rest of the steps in the Reverse ETL setup guide.
If you create a network policy with Snowflake and are located in the US, add52.25.130.38/32and34.223.203.0/28to the “Allowed IP Addresses” list.
If you create a network policy with Snowflake and are located in the EU, add3.251.148.96/29to your “Allowed IP Addresses” list.

Functions let you create your own sources and destinations directly within your workspace to bring new types of data into Segment and send data to new tools with just a few lines of JavaScript - no additional infrastructure required.
Functions is available to all customer plan types with a free allotment of usage hours. Read more aboutFunctions usage limits, or seeyour workspace’s Functions usage stats.

Functions can help you bring external data into Segment (Source functions) and send data in Segment out to external destinations (Destination functions). UseInsert functionsto transform data before it reaches your downstream destinations. Functions are scoped to your specific workspace. If you’re a technology partner and want to build a new integration and publish it in Segment’s catalog, see theDeveloper Center documentation.
Source functions receive external data from a webhook and can create Segment events, objects, or both. Source functions have access to the full power of JavaScript so you can validate and transform the incoming data and even make external API requests to annotate your data.
Use cases:
Learn more aboutsource functions.
Destination functions can take events from a Segment source, transform the events, and deliver them to external APIs. Destination functions can make arbitrary requests to annotate data, as well.
Use cases:
Learn more aboutdestination functions.
Destination insert functions help you enrich your data with code before you send it to downstream destinations.
Use cases:
To learn more, visitdestination insert functions.
With Functions Copilot, you can instrument custom integrations, enrich and transform data, and even secure sensitive data nearly instantaneously without writing a line of code.
To learn more, visit theFunctions Copilot documentation.
IP Allowlisting uses a NAT gateway to route outbound Functions traffic from Segment’s servers to your destinations through a limited range of IP addresses, which can prevent malicious actors from establishing TCP and UDP connections with your integrations.
IP Allowlisting is available for customers on Business Tier plans.
To learn more, visitSegment’s IP Allowlisting documentation.

Source functions allow you to gather data from any third-party applications without worrying about setting up or maintaining any infrastructure.
All functions are scoped to your workspace, so members of other workspaces cannot view or use them.
Functions is available to all customer plan types with a free allotment of usage hours. Read more aboutFunctions usage limits, or seeyour workspace’s Functions usage stats.

After you clickBuild, a code editor appears. Use the editor to write the code for your function, configure settings, and test the function’s behavior.
Tip:Want to see some example functions? Check out the templates available in the Functions UI, or in the open-sourceSegment Functions Library. (Contributions welcome!)

Source functions must have anonRequest()function defined.
This function is executed by Segment for each HTTPS request sent to this function’s webhook.
TheonRequest()function receives two arguments:
To parse the JSON body of the request, use therequest.json()method, as in the following example:
Use therequest.headersobject to get values of request headers.
Since it’s an instance ofHeaders, the API is the same in both the browser and in Node.js.
To access the URL details, refer torequest.urlobject, which is an instance ofURL.
You can send messages to the Segment API using theSegmentobject:
UseIdentify callsto connect users with their actions, and to record traits about them.
TheSegment.identify()method accepts an object with the following fields:
Track callsrecord actions that users perform, along with any properties that describe the action.
TheSegment.track()method accepts an object with the following fields:
Group callsassociate users with a group, like a company, organization, account, project, or team.
TheSegment.group()method accepts an object with the following fields:
Page callsrecord whenever a user sees a page of your website, along with any other properties about the page.
TheSegment.page()method accepts an object with the following fields:
Screen callsrecord when a user sees a screen, the mobile equivalent ofPage, in your mobile app.
TheSegment.screen()method accepts an object with the following fields:
TheAlias callmerges two user identities, effectively connecting two sets of user data as one.
TheSegment.alias()method accepts an object with the following fields:
The Set call usesthe object APIto save object data to your Redshift, BigQuery, Snowflake, or other data warehouses supported by Segment.
TheSegment.set()method accepts an object with the following fields:
When you use theset()method, you won’t see events in the Source Debugger. Segment only sends events to connected warehouses.
On March 26, 2024, Segment is upgrading the Functions runtime environment to Node.js v18, which is the current long-term support (LTS) release.
This upgrade keeps your runtime current with industry standards. Based on theAWS LambdaandNode.jssupport schedule, Node.js v16 is no longer inMaintenance LTS. Production applications should only use releases of Node.js that are inActive LTSorMaintenance LTS.
All new functions will use Node.js v18 starting March 26, 2024.
For existing functions, this change automatically occurs as you update and deploy an existing function. Segment recommends that you check your function post-deployment to ensure everything’s working. Your function may face issues due to the change in sytax between different Node.js versions and dependency compatibility.
Limited time opt-out option
If you need more time to prepare, you can opt out of the update before March 19, 2024.Note that if you opt out:- The existing functions will continue working on Node.js v16.- You won’t be able to create new functions after July 15, 2024.- You won’t be able to update existing functions after August 15, 2024.- You won’t receive future bug fixes, enhancements, and dependency updates to the functions runtime.Contact Segmentto opt-out or with any questions.
Node.js 18
Segment strongly recommends updating to Node.js v18 to benefit from future runtime updates, the latest security, and performance improvements.
Functions do not currently support importing dependencies, but you cancontact Segment Supportto request that one be added.
The following dependencies are installed in the function environment by default.
zlib v1.0.5exposed aszlib.zlib
uuidv5is exposed as an object. Useuuidv5.uuidv5to access its functions. For example:
zlib’s asynchronous methodsinflateanddeflatemust be used withasyncorawait. For example:
The following Node.js modules are available:
Other built-in Node.js modulesaren’t available.
For more information on using theaws-sdkmodule, see how toset up functions for calling AWS APIs.
Basic cache storage is available through thecacheobject, which has the following methods defined:
Some important notes about the cache:
Settings allow you to pass configurable variables to your function, which is the best way to pass sensitive information such as security tokens. For example, you might usesettingsas placeholders to use information such as an API endpoint and API key. This way, you can use the same code with different settings for different purposes. When you deploy a function in your workspace, you are prompted to fill out these settings to configure the function.
First, add a setting inSettingstab in the code editor:

ClickAdd Settingto add your new setting.

You can configure the details about this setting, which change how it’s displayed to anyone using your function:
As you change the values, a preview to the right updates to show how your setting will look and work.
ClickAdd Settingto save the new setting.
Once you save a setting, it appears in theSettingstab for the function. You can edit or delete settings from this tab.

Next, fill out this setting’s value inTesttab, so that you can run the function and check the setting values being passed.
Note, this value is only for testing your function.

Now that you’ve configured a setting and filled in a test value, you can add code to read its value and run the function:
When you deploy a source function in your workspace, you are prompted to fill out settings to configure the source. You can access these settings later by navigating to the Source Settings page for the source function.

You can test your code directly from the editor in two ways: either by receiving real HTTPS requests through a webhook, or by manually constructing an HTTPS request from within the editor.
The advantage of testing your source function with webhooks is that all incoming data is real, so you can test behavior while closely mimicking the production conditions.
Note: Segment has updated the webhook URL toapi.segmentapis.com/functions. To use webhooks with your function, you must:
You can use webhooks to test the source function either by sending requests manually (using any HTTP client such as cURL, Postman, or Insomnia), or by pasting the webhook into an external server that supports webhooks (such as Slack).A common Segment use case is to connect a Segmentwebhooks destinationorwebhook actions destinationto a test source, where the Webhook URL/endpoint that is used corresponds to the provided source function’s endpoint, then you can trigger test events to send directly to that source, which are routed through your Webhook destination and continue on to the source function: Source → Webhook destination → Source Function.
From the source function editor, copy the provided webhook URL (endpoint) from the “Auto-fill via Webhook” dialog.Note: When a new source is created that utilizes a source function, the new source’s endpoint (webhook URL) will differ from the URL that is provided in the source function’s test environment.
To test the source function:
You can also manually construct the headers and body of an HTTPS request inside the editor and test with this data without using webhooks.
TheContent-TypeHeader is required when testing the function:

After you finish building your source function, clickConfigureto name it, then clickCreate Functionto save it.
The source function appears on theFunctionspage in your workspace’s catalog.
If you’re editing an existing function, you canSavechanges without updating instances of the function that are already deployed and running.
You can also choose toSave & Deployto save the changes, and then choose which already-deployed functions to update with your changes. You might needadditional permissionsto update existing functions.
Your function may encounter errors that you missed during testing, or you might intentionally throw errors in your code (for example, if the incoming request is missing required fields).
If your function throws an error, execution halts immediately. Segment captures the incoming request, any console logs the function printed, and the error, and displays this information in the function’sErrorstab. You can use this tab to find and fix unexpected errors.

Functions can throwan Error or custom Error, and you can also add additional helpful context in logs using theconsoleAPI.
For example:
Warning:Do not log sensitive data, such as personally-identifying information (PII), authentication tokens, or other secrets. You should especially avoid logging entire request/response payloads. Segment only retains the 100 most recent errors and logs for up to 30 days but theErrorstab may be visible to other workspace members if they have the necessary permissions.
Segment only attempts to run your source function again if aRetryerror occurs.
Functions have specific roles which can be used foraccess managementin your Segment workspace.
Access to functions is controlled by two permissionsroles:
You also need additionalSource Adminpermissions to enable source functions, connect destination functions to a source, or to deploy changes to existing functions.
If you are aWorkspace OwnerorFunctions Admin, you can manage your source function from theFunctionstab in the catalog.
You must be aWorkspace OwnerorSource Adminto connect an instance of your function in your workspace.
From theFunctions tab, clickConnect Sourceand follow the prompts to set it up in your workspace.
After configuring, find the webhook URL - either on theOvervieworSettings → Endpointpage.
Copy and paste this URL into the upstream tool or service to send data to this source.
Segment retries invocations that throw RetryError or Timeout errors up to six times. After six attempts, the request is dropped.
The initial wait time for the retried event is a random value between one and three minutes.
Wait time increases exponentially after every retry attempt. The maximum wait time between attempts can reach 20 minutes.
Retry errors only appear in the source function error logs if the event has exhausted all six retry attempts and, as a result, has been dropped.
The maximum payload size for an incoming webhook payload is 512 KiB.
The execution time limit is five seconds, however Segment strongly recommends that you keep execution time as low as possible. If you are making multiple external requests you can use async / await to make them concurrently, which will help keep your execution time low.
Segment alphabetizes payload fields that come in todeployedsource functions. Segment doesn’t alphabetize payloads in the Functions tester. If you need to verify the exact payload that hits a source function, alphabetize it first. You can then make sure it matches what the source function ingests.
GETrequests are not supported with a source function. Source functions can only receive data throughPOSTrequests.
No. Tracking Pixels operate client-side only and need to be loaded onto your website directly. Source Functions operate server-side only, and aren’t able to capture or implement client-side tracking code. If the tool you’re hoping to integrate is server-side, then you can use a Source Function to connect it to Segment.
The test function interface has a 4KB console logging limit. Outputs surpassing this limit will not be visible in the user interface.
No, Source Functions can’t send custom responses to the tool that triggered the Function’s webhook. Source Functions can only send a success or failure response, not a custom one.
This error occurs because Segment prevents Source Functions from sending data back to their own webhook endpoint (https://fn.segmentapis.com). Allowing this could create an infinite loop where the function continuously triggers itself.
To resolve this error, check your Function code and ensure the URLhttps://fn.segmentapis.comis not included. This URL is used to send data to a Source Function and shouldn’t appear in your outgoing requests. Once you remove this URL from your code, you’ll be able to save the Function successfully.

Tip:Want to see some example functions? Check out the templates available in the Functions UI, or in the open-sourceSegment Functions Library. (Contributions welcome!)
Segment invokes a separate part of the function (called a “handler”) for each event type that you send to your destination function.
Your function isn’t invoked for an event if you’ve configured adestination filter, and the event doesn’t pass the filter.
The default source code template includes handlers for all event types. You don’t need to implement all of them - just use the ones you need, and skip the ones you don’t.
Destination functions can define handlers for each message type in theSegment spec:
Each of the functions above accepts two arguments:
The example below shows a destination function that listens for “Track” events, and sends some details about them to an external service.
To change which event type the handler listens to, you can rename it to the name of the message type. For example, if you rename this functiononIdentify, it listens for “Identify” events instead.
Functions’ runtime includes afetch()polyfill using anode-fetchpackage. Check out thenode-fetch documentationfor usage examples.
Segment considers a function’s execution successful if it finishes without error. You can alsothrowan error to create a failure on purpose. Use these errors to validate event data before processing it, to ensure the function works as expected.
You canthrowthe following pre-defined error types to indicate that the function ran as expected, but that data was not deliverable:
The examples show basic uses of these error types.
If you don’t supply a function for an event type, Segment throws anEventNotSupportederror by default.
You can incorporate a atry-catchblock to ensure smooth operation of functions even when fetch calls fail. This allows for the interception of any errors during the API call, enabling the application of specific error handling procedures, such as error logging for future debugging, or the assignment of fallback values when the API call is unsuccessful. By positioning the continuation logic either outside thetry-catchblock or within afinallyblock, the function is guaranteed to proceed with its execution, maintaining its workflow irrespective of the outcome of the API call.
You can read more abouterror handlingbelow.
On March 26, 2024, Segment is upgrading the Functions runtime environment to Node.js v18, which is the current long-term support (LTS) release.
This upgrade keeps your runtime current with industry standards. Based on theAWS LambdaandNode.jssupport schedule, Node.js v16 is no longer inMaintenance LTS. Production applications should only use releases of Node.js that are inActive LTSorMaintenance LTS.
All new functions will use Node.js v18 starting March 26, 2024.
For existing functions, this change automatically occurs as you update and deploy an existing function. Segment recommends that you check your function post-deployment to ensure everything’s working. Your function may face issues due to the change in sytax between different Node.js versions and dependency compatibility.
Limited time opt-out option
If you need more time to prepare, you can opt out of the update before March 19, 2024.Note that if you opt out:- The existing functions will continue working on Node.js v16.- You won’t be able to create new functions after July 15, 2024.- You won’t be able to update existing functions after August 15, 2024.- You won’t receive future bug fixes, enhancements, and dependency updates to the functions runtime.Contact Segmentto opt-out or with any questions.
Node.js 18
Segment strongly recommends updating to Node.js v18 to benefit from future runtime updates, the latest security, and performance improvements.
Functions do not currently support importing dependencies, but you cancontact Segment Supportto request that one be added.
The following dependencies are installed in the function environment by default.
zlib v1.0.5exposed aszlib.zlib
uuidv5is exposed as an object. Useuuidv5.uuidv5to access its functions. For example:
zlib’s asynchronous methodsinflateanddeflatemust be used withasyncorawait. For example:
The following Node.js modules are available:
Other built-in Node.js modulesaren’t available.
For more information on using theaws-sdkmodule, see how toset up functions for calling AWS APIs.
Basic cache storage is available through thecacheobject, which has the following methods defined:
Some important notes about the cache:
Settings allow you to pass configurable variables to your function, which is the best way to pass sensitive information such as security tokens. For example, you might usesettingsas placeholders to use information such as an API endpoint and API key. This way, you can use the same code with different settings for different purposes. When you deploy a function in your workspace, you are prompted to fill out these settings to configure the function.
First, add a setting inSettingstab in the code editor:

ClickAdd Settingto add your new setting.

You can configure the details about this setting, which change how it’s displayed to anyone using your function:
As you change the values, a preview to the right updates to show how your setting will look and work.
ClickAdd Settingto save the new setting.
Once you save a setting, it appears in theSettingstab for the function. You can edit or delete settings from this tab.

Next, fill out this setting’s value in theTesttab, so you can run the function and verify that the correct setting value is passed. (This value is only for testing your function.)
Now that you’ve configured a setting and entered a test value, you can add code to read its value and run the function, as in the example below:
When you deploy your destination function in your workspace, you fill out the settings on the destination configuration page, similar to how you would configure a normal destination.
You must pass the settings object to the function at runtime. Functions can’t access the settings object when it’s stored as a global variable.
You can test your code directly from the editor in two ways:
ClickUse Sample Eventand select the source to use events from.

ClickRunto test your function with the event you selected.
You can also manually include your own JSON payload of a Segment event, instead of fetching a sample from one of your workspace sources.

If your function fails, you can check the error details and logs in theOutputsection.
Batch handlers are an extension of destination functions. When you define anonBatchhandler alongside the handler functions for single events (for example:onTrackoronIdentity), you’re telling Segment that the destination function can accept and handle batches of events.
Batching is available for destination and destination insert functions only.
Consider creating a batch handler if:
If a batched function receives too low a volume of events (under one event per second) to be worth batching, Segment may not invoke the batch handler.
Segment collects the events over a short period of time and combines them into a batch. The system flushes them when the batch reaches a certain number of events, or when the batch has been waiting for a specified wait time.
To create a batch handler, define anonBatchfunction within your destination function.
You can also use the “Default Batch” template found in the Functions editor to get started quickly.
TheonBatchhandler is an optional extension. Destination functions must still contain single event handlers as a fallback, in cases where Segment does not receive enough events to execute the batch.
The handler function receives an array of events. The events can be of any supported type and a single batch may contain more than one event type. Handler functions can also receive function settings. Here is an example of what a batch can look like:
For example, you could send the array of events to an external services batch endpoint:
Segment batches together any eventof any typethat it sees over a short period of time to increase batching efficiency and give you the flexibility to decide how batches are created. If you want to split batches by event type, you can implement this in your functions code by writing a handler.
If your downstream endpoint requires events of a single type, you can write a handler that groups events by type, and then handles the events.
By default, Functions waits up to 10 seconds to form a batch of 20 events. You can increase the number of events included in each batch (up to 400 events per batch) by contactingSegment support. Segment recommends users who wish to include fewer than 20 events per batch use destination functions without theonBatchhandler.
TheFunctions editing environmentsupports testing batch handlers.
To test the batch handler:
The Sample Event option tests single events only. You must use Manual Mode to add more than one event so you can test batch handlers.
The editor displays logs and request traces from the batch handler.
ThePublic APIFunctions/Preview endpoint also supports testing batch handlers. The payload must be a batch of events as a JSON array.
Standardfunction error typesapply to batch handlers. Segment attempts to retry the batch in the case of Timeout or Retry errors. For all other error types, Segment discards the batch. It’s also possible to report a partial failure by returning status of each event in the batch. Segment retries only the failed events in a batch until those events are successful or until they result in a permanent error.
For example, after receiving the responses above from theonBatchhandler, Segment only retriesevent_4andevent_5.
Once you finish building your destination function, clickConfigureto name it, then clickCreate Functionto save it.
Once you do that, the destination function appears on theFunctionspage in your workspace’s catalog.
If you’re editing an existing function, you canSavechanges without updating instances of the function that are already deployed and running.
You can also choose toSave & Deployto save the changes, and then choose which of the already-deployed functions to update with your changes.You might need additional permissionsto update existing functions.
If your function throws an error, execution halts immediately. Segment captures the event, any outgoing requests/responses, any logs the function might have printed, as well as the error itself.
Segment then displays the captured error information in theEvent Deliverypage for your destination. You can use this information to find and fix unexpected errors.
You can throwan error or a custom errorand you can also add helpful context in logs using theconsoleAPI. For example:
Warning:Do not log sensitive data, such as personally-identifying information (PII), authentication tokens, or other secrets. Avoid logging entire request/response payloads. TheFunction Logstab may be visible to other workspace members if they have the necessary permissions.
Functions execute only in response to incoming data, but the environments that functions run in are generally long-running. Because of this, you can use global variables to cache small amounts of information between invocations. For example, you can reduce the number of access tokens you generate by caching a token, and regenerating it only after it expires. Segment cannot make any guarantees about the longevity of environments, but by using this strategy, you can improve the performance and reliability of your Functions by reducing the need for redundant API requests.
This example code fetches an access token from an external API and refreshes it every hour:
Functions have specific roles which can be used foraccess managementin your Segment workspace.
Access to functions is controlled by two permissionsroles:
You also need additionalSource Adminpermissions to enable source functions, connect destination functions to a source, or to deploy changes to existing functions.
If you are aWorkspace OwnerorFunctions Admin, you can manage your function from theFunctionspage.
You can useDestination Event Deliveryto understand if Segment encounters any issues delivering your source data to destinations. Errors that the Function throws appear here.
If any of your deployed function instances are failing consistently, they will also appear inConnection Health.
In addition to usingDestination Filtersand thePrivacy Portalto manage which events and properties are sent to your destination function, you can reference the destination function directly in the integrations object of the Segment payload. For example:
In the example above, the integrations object directly references and enables the destination function (My Destination Function), located inside your workspace (My Workspace). Include the workspace name in parentheses, as shown in the example above. Like all items in the integration object, destination function and workspace names are case sensitive.
Yes, Functions access is logged in theAudit Trail, so user activity related to functions appears in the logs.
Yes, Segment retries invocations that throw RetryError or Timeout errors (temporary errors only). Segment’s internal system retries failed functions API calls for four hours with a randomized exponential backoff after each attempt. This substantially improves delivery rates.
Retrieswork the same for both functions and cloud-mode destinations in Segment.
No, Segment can’t guarantee the order in which the events are delivered to an endpoint.
No, destination functions are currently available as cloud-mode destinations only. Segment is in the early phases of exploration and discovery for supporting customer “web plugins” for custom device-mode destinations and other use cases, but this is unsupported today.
If you are a partner, looking to publish your destination and distribute your app through Segment catalog, visit theDeveloper Centerand check out the Segmentpartner docs.
TheEvent Delivery tabcontinues to show metrics for individual events, even if they are batched by your function code. For more information, seeDestination functions logs and errors.
A function’s use depends on the number of times it’s invoked, and the amount of time it takes to execute. When you enable batching, Segment invokes your functiononce per batchrather than once per event. The volume of events flowing through the function determines the number of batches, which determines the number of invocations.
If you’re sending your batch to an external service, the execution time of the function depends on the end-to-end latency of that service’s batch endpoint, which may be higher than an endpoint that receives a single event.
When data leaves Segment’s servers to go to various destinations (not including warehouses), Segment uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) and utilizes many different machines in order to send requests.
The IP addresses that are used to send these requests can be foundon Amazon’s website. If you want to allowlist these specific IP addresses, you need to allowlist all of the IP addresses from your workspace’s location range. Below are the ranges:
Yes, to do so, remove themessageIdand thewriteKeyfrom the payload in your Function code. Leaving either field on your payload will cause unexpected behavior that may cause your event to be delivered to the wrong source or to not be delivered at all.
Incorporating console.log() statements in your Destination Function code aids in debugging. However, logs generated by these statements will only be accessible in theEvent Deliveryview if the payloads encounter errors during processing. Logs from successfully processed payloads are not displayed.
The test function interface has a 4KB console logging limit. Outputs larger than this limit are not visible in the user interface.

Use Destination Insert Functions to enrich, transform, or filter your data before it reaches downstream destinations.
Implement advanced data computation: Write custom computation, operations, and business logic on streaming data that you send to downstream destinations.
Enrich your data: Use destination insert functions with Segment’s Profile API or third party sources to add additional context to your data and create personalized customer experiences.
Support data compliance: Use destination insert functions to support data masking, encryption, decryption, improved PII data handling, and tokenization.
Customize filtration for your destinations: Create custom logic with nested if-else statements, regex, custom business rules, and more to filter event data.
Destination Insert Functions are not compatible with IP Allowlisting
For more information, see theIP Allowlistingdocumentation.
There are two ways you can access destination insert functions from your Segment space:
To create an insert function from Segment’s catalog:
For data to flow to your downstream destinations, you’ll need to connect your insert function to a destination:
Storage destinations are not compatible with Destination Insert Functions
You cannot connect an Insert Function to a storage destination at this time.
To access insert functions through the Destinations tab:
Use this page to edit and manage insert functions in your workspace.
You can also use this page toenable destination insert functionsin your workspace.
To prevent “Unsupported Event Type” errors, ensure your insert function handles all event types (page, track, identify, alias, group) that are expected to be sent to the destination. It is highly recommended totest the functionwith each event type to confirm they are being handled as expected.
Segment invokes a separate part of the function (called a “handler”) for each event type that you send to your destination insert function.
If you’ve configured adestination filterand the event doesn’t pass the filter, then your function isn’t invoked for that event as Segment applies destination filters before insert functions. The same is true for theintegrations object). If an event is configured with the integrations object not to go to a particular destination, then the insert function connected to that destination won’t be invoked.
The default source code template includes handlers for all event types. You don’t need to implement all of them - just use the ones you need, and skip the ones you don’t. For event types that you want to send through the destination, return the event in the respective event handlers.
Removing the handler for a specific event type results in blocking the events of that type from arriving at their destination. To keep an event type as is but still send it downstream, add areturn eventinside the event type handler statement.
Insert functions can define handlers for each message type in theSegment spec:
Each of the functions above accepts two arguments:
The example below shows a function that listens for “Track” events, and sends some details about them to an external service.
To change which event type the handler listens to, you can rename it to the name of the message type. For example, if you rename this functiononIdentify, it listens for “Identify” events instead.
To ensure the Destination processes an event payload modified by the function, return theeventobject at the handler’s end.
Functions’ runtime includes afetch()polyfill using anode-fetchpackage. Check out thenode-fetch documentationfor usage examples.
Segment considers a function’s execution successful if it finishes without error. You canthrowan error to create a failure on purpose. Use these errors to validate event data before processing it to ensure the function works as expected.
You canthrowthe following pre-defined error types to indicate that the function ran as expected, but the data was not deliverable:

Other built-in Node.js modulesaren’t available.
For more information on using theaws-sdkmodule, see how toset up functions for calling AWS APIs.
Basic cache storage is available through thecacheobject, which has the following methods defined:
Some important notes about the cache:
A payload must come into the pipeline with the attributes that allow it to match your mapping triggers. You can’t use an Insert Function to change the event to match your mapping triggers. If an event comes into an Actions destination and already matches a mapping trigger, that mapping subscription will fire. If a payload doesn’t come to the Actions destination matching a mapping trigger, even if an Insert Function is meant to alter the event to allow it to match a trigger, it won’t fire that mapping subscription. Segment sees the mapping trigger first in the pipeline, so a payload won’t make it to the Insert Function at all if it doesn’t come into the pipeline matching a mapping trigger.
Unlike Source Functions and Destination Functions, which return multiple events, an Insert Function only returns one event. When the Insert Function receives an event, it sends the event to be handled by its configured mappings.
If you would likemultiple mappings triggered by the same event:
You can also configure the Insert Function to add additional data to the event’s payload before it’s handled by the mappings and configure the mapping’s available fields to reference the payload’s available fields.
You may want to consider thecontext object’savailable fields when adding new data to the event’s payload.
Settings allow you to pass configurable variables to your function, which is the best way to pass sensitive information such as security tokens. For example, you might usesettingsas placeholders to use information such as an API endpoint and API key. This way, you can use the same code with different settings for different purposes. When you deploy a function in your workspace, you are prompted to fill out these settings to configure the function.
First, add a setting inSettingstab in the code editor:

ClickAdd Settingto add your new setting.

You can configure the details about this setting, which change how it’s displayed to anyone using your function:
As you change the values, a preview to the right updates to show how your setting will look and work.
ClickAdd Settingto save the new setting.
Once you save a setting, it appears in theSettingstab for the function. You can edit or delete settings from this tab.

Next, fill out this setting’s value in theTesttab, so you can run the function and verify that the correct setting value is passed. (This value is only for testing your function.)
Now that you’ve configured a setting and entered a test value, you can add code to read its value and run the function, as in the example below:
When you deploy your destination insert function in your workspace, you fill out the settings on the destination configuration page, similar to how you would configure a normal destination.
You can manually test your code from the functions editor:
The Event Tester won’t make use of an Insert Function, show how an Insert Function impacts your data, or send data downstream through the Insert Function pipeline. The Event Tester is not impacted by an Insert Function at all. Use the Function tester rather than the Event Tester to see how your Insert Function impacts your data.
Once you finish building your insert function, clickNext: Configure & Createto name it, then clickCreate Functionto save it.
Once you do that, you’ll see the insert function from the Functions page in your catalog.
If you’re editing an existing function, you can save changes without updating the instances of the function that are already deployed and running.
You can also choose toSave & Deployto save the changes, then choose which already-deployed functions to update with your changes.
You may need additional permissions to update existing functions.
You need to enable your insert function for it to process your data.
To enable your insert function:
To prevent your insert function from processing data, toggle Enable Function off.
Batch handlers are an extension of insert functions. When you define anonBatchhandler alongside the handler functions for single events (for example,onTrackoronIdentity), you’re telling Segment that the insert function can accept and handle batches of events.
Batching is available for destination and destination insert functions only.
Consider creating a batch handler if:
You have a high-throughput function and want to reduce cost.When you define a batch handler, Segment invokes the function once perbatch, rather than once per event. As long as the function’s execution time isn’t adversely affected, the reduction in invocations should lead to a reduction in cost.
Your destination supports batching. When your downstream destination supports sending data downstream in batches you can define a batch handler to avoid throttling. Batching for functions is independent of batch size supported by the destination. Segment automatically handles batch formation for destinations.
If a batched function receives too low a volume of events (under one event per second) to be worth batching, Segment may not invoke the batch handler.
Segment collects the events over a short period of time and combines them into a batch. The system flushes them when the batch reaches a certain number of events, or when the batch has been waiting for a specified wait time.
To create a batch handler, define anonBatchfunction within your destination insert function. You can also use the “Default Batch” template found in the Functions editor to get started quickly.
TheonBatchhandler is an optional extension. Destination insert functions must still contain single event handlers as a fallback, in cases where Segment doesn’t receive enough events to execute the batch.
The handler function receives an array of events. The events can be of any supported type and a single batch may contain more than one event type. Handler functions can also receive function settings. Here is an example of what a batch can look like:
Segment batches together any eventof any typethat it sees over a short period of time to increase batching efficiency and give you the flexibility to decide how batches are created. If you want to split batches by event type, you can implement this in your functions code by writing a handler.
By default, Functions waits up to 10 seconds to form a batch of 20 events. You can increase the number of events included in each batch (up to 400 events per batch) by contactingSegment support. Segment recommends users who wish to include fewer than 20 events per batch use destination insert functions without theonBatchhandler.
TheFunctions editing environmentsupports testing batch handlers.
To test the batch handler:
The Sample Event option tests single events only. You must use Manual Mode to add more than one event so you can test batch handlers.
The editor displays logs and request traces from the batch handler.
ThePublic APIFunctions/Preview endpoint also supports testing batch handlers. The payload must be a batch of events as a JSON array.
Events in a batch can be filtered out using custom logic. The filtered events will be surfaced in theEvent Deliverypage with reason asFiltered at insert function
Standardfunction error typesapply to batch handlers. Segment attempts to retry the batch in the case of Timeout or Retry errors. For all other error types, Segment discards the batch.
Segment only attempts to send the event to your destination insert function again if aRetryerror occurs.
You can view Segment’s list ofIntegration Error Codesfor more information about what might cause an error.
If your function throws an error, execution halts immediately. Segment captures the event, any outgoing requests/responses, any logs the function might have printed, as well as the error itself.
Segment then displays the captured error information in theEvent Deliverypage for your destination. You can use this information to find and fix unexpected errors.
You can throwan error or a custom errorand you can also add helpful context in logs using theconsoleAPI. For example:
Don’t log sensitive data, such as personally-identifying information (PII), authentication tokens, or other secrets. Avoid logging entire request/response payloads. TheFunction Logstab may be visible to other workspace members if they have the necessary permissions.
Functions execute only in response to incoming data, but the environments that functions run in are generally long-running. Because of this, you can use global variables to cache small amounts of information between invocations. For example, you can reduce the number of access tokens you generate by caching a token, and regenerating it only after it expires. Segment cannot make any guarantees about the longevity of environments, but by using this strategy, you can improve the performance and reliability of your Functions by reducing the need for redundant API requests.
This example code fetches an access token from an external API and refreshes it every hour:
Functions have specific roles which can be used foraccess managementin your Segment workspace.
Access to functions is controlled by two permissionsroles:
You also need additionalSource Adminpermissions to enable source functions, connect destination functions to a source, or to deploy changes to existing functions.
If you are aWorkspace OwnerorFunctions Admin, you can manage your function from theFunctionspage.
Yes, Functions access is logged in theAudit Trail, so user activity related to functions appears in the logs.
Yes, Segment retries invocations that throw RetryError or Timeout errors (temporary errors only). Segment’s internal system retries failed functions API calls for four hours with a randomized exponential backoff after each attempt. This substantially improves delivery rates.
Retrieswork the same for both functions and cloud-mode destinations in Segment.
No, Segment can’t guarantee the order in which the events are delivered to an endpoint.
No, specifying an endpoint is not always required for insert functions. If your function is designed to transform or filter data internally—such as adding new properties to events or filtering based on existing properties—you won’t need to specify an external endpoint.
However, if your function aims to enrich event data by fetching additional information from an external service, then you must specify the endpoint. This would be the URL of the external service’s API where the enriched or captured data is sent.
No, Destination Insert Functions are currently available for use with Cloud Mode (server-side) destinations only. Segment is in the early phases of exploration and discovery for supporting customer web plugins for custom Device Mode destinations and other use cases, but this is unsupported today.
Insert Functions are only supported by Cloud Mode (server-side) destinations and aren’t compatible with Storage destinations.
Yes, you can connect an insert function to multiple destinations.
No, you can only connect one insert function to a destination.
Yes, you can have both destination filters and destination insert functions in the same connection.
Segment’s data pipeline applies Destination Filters before invoking Insert Functions.
There is an 120-Character limit for the insert function display name.
This error occurs because your insert function code might not be handling all event types (Page, Track, Identify, Alias, Group) that your destination supports. When these unlisted events pass through the function, they are rejected with the “Unsupported Event Type” error.
To resolve this, verify your insert function includes handlers for all expected event types and returns the event object for each. Here’s an example of how you can structure your insert function to handle all event types:
By including handlers for all the major event types, you ensure that all supported events are processed correctly, preventing the “Unsupported Event Type” error. Always test your updated code before implementing it in production.
The test function interface has a 4KB console logging limit. Outputs surpassing this limit won’t be visible in the user interface.

Segment Functions create reusable code that can be run in your Segment workspace either as sources to format incoming events, or as destinations, to handle specific event types.
When you create a function, write code for it, and save it, the function appears in the Catalog in your workspaceonly. You can then deploy that function in your workspace just as you would a conventional source or destination.
Access to Functions is controlled by specificaccess management roles. You may need additional access to create and deploy functions.
OnlyFunctions adminscan create or edit functions.
Select the type of function you want to build, and clickBuild.
When you clickBuild, a code editor appears. Different template code is available depending on which type of function you created.
After you clickCreate Function, the function appears on theFunctions catalog pagein your workspace.
If you are aWorkspace OwnerorFunctions Admin, you can manage your function from theFunctions catalog page.
If you’re editing an existing function, you canSavechanges without changing the behavior of existing instances of the function.
You can also choose toSave & Deployto push changes to all, or specific functions in your workspace that are already deployed. You might need additional permissions to deploy these changes.
You have the option to test your functions code with either a sample event or by loading a default event that you can customize yourself.
Once the payload you want to test is ready, clickRun.
If you create settings in your function, then you need to fill in the setting values before clickingRun.
You must be aWorkspace OwnerorSource Adminto connect an instance of your function in your workspace.
If you’re editing an existing function, you canSavechanges without changing the behavior of your deployed function. You can also choose toSave & Deployto push changes to all, or specific functions in your workspace that are already deployed.
When you deploy your destination function in your workspace, you fill out the settings on the destination configuration page, similar to how you would configure a normal destination.
With Functions Versioning, you can access a complete change history for each source or destination function. View version history and creation details, then use a unified or split display to compare code and restore previous versions of a function.
To view the version history of a function:
Select previous versions to compare code using aunifiedorsplitview. With the split view, Segment displays the latest version on the left and the version you’ve selected on the right.
Unified and split compare screens are read-only. While you can copy code, you can’t make changes directly from these screens.
In the Version History panel, Segment displaysLATESTandDEPLOYEDlabels that represent a function version state. You’ll see theLATESTversion at the top.
Segment labels a version as theLATESTwhen:
TheDEPLOYEDversion is the function version that’s currently deployed.
To restore a previous function version:
You can use Functions Versioning with Segment’sPublic APIto retrieve version history records and source code, as well as to restore previous versions.
Here are some Public API use case examples:
Get Version history: Use the/versionsendpoint to retrieve a list of version records and metadata of a certain page size. You can also use this endpoint to get version source code for a given version ID.
Restore a previous version: Use the/restoreendpoint to restore a previous function version. This creates a new version with the same source as the version you are restoring.
Create or update versions: Create or update a function to add a version record and save the source code.
Deploy a function: Use the Public API to deploy a function. After you deploy, Segment marks the function version asDEPLOYED. Learn more about function version states in theLatest and deployed versionssection.
View Segment’sPublic APIdocs for more information on how to use Functions Versioning with the Public API.
Functions have specific roles which can be used foraccess managementin your Segment workspace.
Access to functions is controlled by two permissionsroles:
You also need additionalSource Adminpermissions to enable source functions, connect destination functions to a source, or to deploy changes to existing functions.
Settings allow you to pass configurable variables to your function, which is the best way to pass sensitive information such as security tokens. For example, you might usesettingsas placeholders to use information such as an API endpoint and API key. This way, you can use the same code with different settings for different purposes. When you deploy a function in your workspace, you are prompted to fill out these settings to configure the function.
First, add a setting inSettingstab in the code editor:

ClickAdd Settingto add your new setting.

You can configure the details about this setting, which change how it’s displayed to anyone using your function:
As you change the values, a preview to the right updates to show how your setting will look and work.
ClickAdd Settingto save the new setting.
Once you save a setting, it appears in theSettingstab for the function. You can edit or delete settings from this tab.

On March 26, 2024, Segment is upgrading the Functions runtime environment to Node.js v18, which is the current long-term support (LTS) release.
This upgrade keeps your runtime current with industry standards. Based on theAWS LambdaandNode.jssupport schedule, Node.js v16 is no longer inMaintenance LTS. Production applications should only use releases of Node.js that are inActive LTSorMaintenance LTS.
All new functions will use Node.js v18 starting March 26, 2024.
For existing functions, this change automatically occurs as you update and deploy an existing function. Segment recommends that you check your function post-deployment to ensure everything’s working. Your function may face issues due to the change in sytax between different Node.js versions and dependency compatibility.
Limited time opt-out option
If you need more time to prepare, you can opt out of the update before March 19, 2024.Note that if you opt out:- The existing functions will continue working on Node.js v16.- You won’t be able to create new functions after July 15, 2024.- You won’t be able to update existing functions after August 15, 2024.- You won’t receive future bug fixes, enhancements, and dependency updates to the functions runtime.Contact Segmentto opt-out or with any questions.
Node.js 18
Segment strongly recommends updating to Node.js v18 to benefit from future runtime updates, the latest security, and performance improvements.
Functions do not currently support importing dependencies, but you cancontact Segment Supportto request that one be added.
The following dependencies are installed in the function environment by default.
zlib v1.0.5exposed aszlib.zlib
uuidv5is exposed as an object. Useuuidv5.uuidv5to access its functions. For example:
zlib’s asynchronous methodsinflateanddeflatemust be used withasyncorawait. For example:
The following Node.js modules are available:
Other built-in Node.js modulesaren’t available.

Paragraphs:
On this page
Functions are billed to your account using the total execution time per month.
Anindividual function’s execution timeis the total time it takes for the function to process events, including mapping, transformations, and requests to external APIs. Generally, requests to external APIs can greatly add to your total execution time.
Yourtotal execution timeis the execution time for all of your active functions accumulated over the course of a month. You can see your current execution time on theFunctions tab of the Usage pagein each workspace. You will receive notifications of your usage when you’ve reached 75%, 90%, and 100% of your allotted execution time.
The amount of time you are allotted changes depending on yourSegment pricing plan.
Segment measures execution time from when the function first receives an event to the time the function either returns successfully or throws an error. If Segment retries your function (for example, if there was a timeout), those retries also count as billable execution time.
Starting on April 8, 2021 Functions usage is measured in millisecond increments. This makes your usage and billing much more precise. Prior to this change, Functions was measured in 100ms increments, and then rounded up. For example, a function that took 80ms to complete was previously billed as 100ms. Using the new usage calculation, it is billed as 80ms.
Functions have a timeout of five seconds. If a function takes longer than five seconds, execution halts and the function is retried periodically for up to four hours.
Execution time can vary widely between use cases, so it is extremely difficult to predict. The best way is to look at the function’s actual execution time and multiply it by the event volume.
Another way to provide a rough estimate is to use an expected source function time of 100ms per invocation, and expected destination function time at 200ms per invocation:
Note:Test runs are generally slower than the time it takes a function to run once it’s deployed. For more accurate estimates, base your estimates on sending data into a production function, and not on timing the test runs.
You can (and should!) useDestination Filtersto reduce the volume of events reaching your function. Filtering events with a Destination Filter prevents the Function from being invoked for that event entirely.
In the most cases, functions are slow due to external requests using thefetch()call. The external API may be under heavy load or it may simply take a long time to process your request.
If you’re making many requests that could be done in parallel, ensure that you’re not doing them sequentially. If the external API takes 400ms to respond and you issue 10 requests, it would take four seconds to do them sequentially versus 400ms to do them in parallel. For example, if you’re waiting for requests to complete inside of a loop you’re making your requests sequentially:
Instead, consider making an array of async requests that are running in parallel and then usingPromise.all()to wait for all of them to complete:
If you’re only issuing a single request in your function and it is slow, you might want to contact the owner of the external API for support.
Each workspace has a default limit of 25 Functions in total across Source, Insert, and Destination Functions. If you want to create more, please reach out toSegment.

Theaws-sdkmodule is built-in, which allows you to make calls to AWS services in your own AWS accounts. The AWS SDK requires additional setup to ensure access to your AWS resources is secure. This page describes the process for allowing your functions to securely call AWS APIs in your AWS account.
To set up your functions to call AWS APIs:
Below is an example destination function that uploads each event received to an S3 bucket (configured using additional “S3 Bucket” and “S3 Bucket Region” settings). It uses the built-in local cache to retain S3 clients between requests to minimize processing time and to allow different instances of the function to use different IAM roles.

Segment Data Lakes will enter Limited Access in October 2024
After Segment Data Lakes enters Limited Access, new customers will no longer be able to create Segment Data Lake instances. Existing Segment customers with Data Lakes instances will continue to receive data and can create Data Lakes Destinations.
Segment recommends considering alternative solutions, likeAWS S3orDatabricks.
Adata lakeis a centralized cloud storage location that holds structured and unstructured data.
Data lakes typically have four layers:

Segment Data Lakes sends Segment data to a cloud data store, either AWS S3 or Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS), in a format optimized to reduce processing for data analytics and data science workloads. Segment data is great for building machine learning models for personalization and recommendations, and for other large scale advanced analytics. Data Lakes reduces the amount of processing required to get real value out of your data.
Segment Data Lakes deletion policies
Segment Data Lakes (AWS) and Segment Data Lakes (Azure) do not support Segment’suser deletion and suppressioncapabilities, as you retain your data in systems that you manage.
To learn more about Segment Data Lakes, check out the Segment blog postIntroducing Segment Data Lakes.
Segment supports Data Lakes hosted on two cloud providers: Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. Each cloud provider has a similar system for managing data, but offer different query engines, post-processing systems, and analytics options.
Data Lakes store Segment data in S3 in a read-optimized encoding format (Parquet) which makes the data more accessible and actionable. To help you zero-in on the right data, Data Lakes also creates logical data partitions and event tables, and integrates metadata with existing schema management tools, such as the AWS Glue Data Catalog. The resulting data set is optimized for use with systems like Spark, Athena, EMR, or machine learning vendors like DataBricks or DataRobot.

Segment sends data to S3 by orchestrating the processing in an EMR (Elastic MapReduce) cluster within your AWS account using an assumed role. Customers using Data Lakes own and pay AWS directly for these AWS services.

Data Lakes store Segment data in ADLS in a read-optimized encoding format (Parquet) which makes the data more accessible and actionable. To help you zero-in on the right data, Data Lakes also creates logical data partitions and event tables, and integrates metadata with existing schema management tools, like the Hive Metastore. The resulting data set is optimized for use with systems like Power BI and Azure HDInsight or machine learning vendors like Azure Databricks or Azure Synapse Analytics.

For detailed Segment Data Lakes (Azure) setup instructions, see theData Lakes setup page.
When setting up your data lake using theData Lakes catalog page, be sure to consider the EMR and AWS IAM components listed below.
Data Lakes uses an EMR cluster to run jobs that load events from all sources into Data Lakes. TheAWS resources portion of the set up instructionssets up an EMR cluster using them5.xlargenode type. Data Lakes keeps the cluster always running, however the cluster auto-scales to ensure it’s not always running at full capacity. Check the Terraform module documentation for theEMR specifications.
Data Lakes uses an IAM role to grant Segment secure access to your AWS account. The required inputs are:
To connect Segment Data Lakes (Azure), you must set up the following components in your Azure environment:
For more information about configuring Segment Data Lakes (Azure), see theData Lakes setup page.
Segment Data Lakes applies a standard schema to make the raw data easier and faster to query. Partitions are applied to the S3 data for granular access to subsets of the data, schema components such as data types are inferred, and a map of the underlying data structure is stored in a Glue Database.
Segment partitions the data in S3 by the Segment source, event type, then the day and hour an event was received by Segment, to ensure that the data is actionable and accessible.
The file path looks like:s3://<top-level-Segment-bucket>/data/<source-id>/segment_type=<event type>/day=<YYYY-MM-DD>/hr=<HH>
Here are a few examples of what events look like:s3:YOUR_BUCKET/segment-data/data/SOURCE_ID/segment_type=identify/day=2020-05-11/hr=11/s3:YOUR_BUCKET/segment-data/data/SOURCE_ID/segment_type=identify/day=2020-05-11/hr=12/s3:YOUR_BUCKET/segment-data/data/SOURCE_ID/segment_type=identify/day=2020-05-11/hr=13/
s3:YOUR_BUCKET/segment-data/data/SOURCE_ID/segment_type=page_viewed/day=2020-05-11/hr=11/s3:YOUR_BUCKET/segment-data/data/SOURCE_ID/segment_type=page_viewed/day=2020-05-11/hr=12/s3:YOUR_BUCKET/segment-data/data/SOURCE_ID/segment_type=page_viewed/day=2020-05-11/hr=13/
By default, the date partition structure isday=<YYYY-MM-DD>/hr=<HH>to give you granular access to the S3 data. You can change the partition structure during theset up process, where you can choose from the following options:
Data Lakes stores the inferred schema and associated metadata of the S3 data in AWS Glue Data Catalog. This metadata includes the location of the S3 file, data converted into Parquet format, column names inferred from the Segment event, nested properties and traits which are now flattened, and the inferred data type.

New columns are appended to the end of the table in the Glue Data Catalog as they are detected.
The schema inferred by Segment is stored in a Glue database within Glue Data Catalog. Segment stores the schema for each source in its own Glue database to organize the data so it is easier to query. To make it easier to find, Segment writes the schema to a Glue database named using the source slug by default. The database name can be modified from the Data Lakes settings.
The recommended IAM role permissions grant Segment access to create the Glue databases on your behalf. If you do not grant Segment these permissions, you must manually create the Glue databases for Segment to write to.
Segment Data Lakes (Azure) applies a consistent schema to make raw data accessible for queries. A transformer automatically calculates the desired schema and uploads a schema JSON file for each event type to your Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) in the/staging/directory.
Segment partitions the data in ALDS by the Segment source, event type, then the day and hour an event was received by Segment, to ensure that the data is actionable and accessible.
The file path looks like this:<storage-account-name>/<container-name>/staging/<source-id>/
Data Lakes infers the data type for an event it receives. Groups of events are polled every hour to infer the data type for that each event.
The data types supported in Segment Data Lakes are:
Once Data Lakes sets a data type for a column, all subsequent data will attempt to be cast into that data type. If incoming data does not match the data type, Data Lakes tries to cast the column to the target data type.
Size mismatch
If the data type in Glue is wider than the data type for a column in an on-going sync (for example, a decimal vs integer, or string vs integer), then the column is cast to the wider type in the Glue table. If the column is narrower (for example, integer in the table versus decimal in the data), the data might be dropped if it cannot be cast at all, or in the case of numbers, some data might lose precision. The original data in Segment remains in its original format, so you can fix the types andreplayto ensure no data is lost. Learn more about type casting by reading theW3School’s Java Type Castingpage.
Data mismatch
If Data Lakes sees a bad data type, for example text in place of a number or an incorrectly formatted date, it attempts a best effort conversion to cast the field to the target data type. Fields that cannot be cast may be dropped. You can also correct the data type in the schema to the desired type and Replay to ensure no data is lost.Contact Segment Supportif you find a data type needs to be corrected.
In addition to Segment’s99% guarantee of no duplicatesfor data within a 24 hour look-back window, Data Lakes have another layer of deduplication to ensure clean data in your Data Lake. Segment removes duplicate events at the time your Data Lake ingests data.  Data Lakes deduplicate any data synced within the last seven days, based on themessageIdfield.
The Data Lakes and Warehouses products are compatible using a mapping, but do not maintain exact parity with each other. This mapping helps you to identify and manage the differences between the two storage solutions, so you can easily understand how the data in each is related. You canread more about the differences between Data Lakes and Warehouses.
When you use Data Lakes, you can either use Data Lakes as youronlysource of data and query all of your data directly from S3 or ADLS or you can use Data Lakes in addition to a data warehouse.
Data Lakes supports data from all event sources, including website libraries, mobile, server and event cloud sources. Data Lakes doesn’t support loadingobject cloud source data, as well as the users and accounts tables from event cloud sources.
Segment doesn’t support User deletions in Data Lakes, but supportsuser suppression.
As the data schema evolves, both Segment Data Lakes (AWS) and Segment Data Lakes (Azure) can detect new columns and add them to Glue Data Catalog or Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS). However, Segment can’t update existing data types. To update Segment-created data types, please reach out toAWS SupportorAzure Support.
Data Lakes has no direct integration withProtocols.
Any changes to events at the source level made with Protocols also change the data for all downstream destinations, including Data Lakes.
Mutated events- If Protocols mutates an event due to a rule set in the Tracking Plan, then that mutation appears in Segment’s internal archives and reflects in your data lake. For example, if you use Protocols to mutate the eventproduct_idto beproductID, then the event appears in both Data Lakes and Warehouses asproductID.
Blocked events- If a Protocols Tracking Plan blocks an event, the event isn’t forwarded to any downstream Segment destinations, including Data Lakes. However events which are only marked with a violationarepassed to Data Lakes.
Data types and labels available in Protocols aren’t supported by Data Lakes.
Data Lakes offers 12 syncs in a 24 hour period and doesn’t offer a custom sync schedule or selective sync.
You can find details on Amazon’spricing for Gluepage. For reference, Data Lakes creates 1 table per event type in your source, and adds 1 partition per hour to the event table.
You can find details on Microsoft’spricing for Azurepage. For reference, Data Lakes creates 1 table per event type in your source, and adds 1 partition per hour to the event table.
AWS Glue has limits across various factors, such as number of databases per account, tables per account, and so on. See thefull list of Glue limitsfor more information.
The most common limits to keep in mind are:
Segment stops creating new tables for the events after you exceed this limit. However you can contact your AWS account representative to increase these limits.
You should also read theadditional considerations in Amazon’s documentationwhen using AWS Glue Data Catalog.

On this page
Segment Data Lakes provide a way to collect large quantities of data in a format that’s optimized for targeted data science and data analytics workflows. You can readmore information about Data Lakesand learnhow they differ from Warehousesin Segment’s Data Lakes documentation.
Segment supports two type of data-lakes:
Lake Formation
You can also set up your Segment Data Lakes usingLake Formation, a fully managed service built on top of the AWS Glue Data Catalog.
To set up Segment Data Lakes, create your AWS resources, enable the Segment Data Lakes destination in the Segment app, and verify that your Segment data is synced to S3 and Glue.
Before you set up Segment Data Lakes, you need the following resources:
You can use theopen source Terraform moduleto automate much of the set up work to get Data Lakes up and running. If you’re familiar with Terraform, you can modify the module to meet your organization’s needs, however Segment guarantees support only for the template as provided. The Data Lakes set up uses Terraform v0.12+. To support more versions of Terraform, the AWS provider must use v4, which is included in the examplemain.tf.
You can also use Segment’smanual setup instructionsto configure these AWS resources, if you prefer.
The Terraform module and manual setup instructions both provide a base level of permissions to Segment (for example, the correct IAM role to allow Segment to create Glue databases on your behalf). If you want stricter permissions, or other custom configurations, you can customize these manually.
After you set up the necessary AWS resources, the next step is to set up the Data Lakes destination within Segment:
In theSegment App, clickAdd Destination, then search for and selectData Lakes.
ClickConfigure Data Lakesand select the source to connect to the Data Lakes destination.Warning: You must add the Workspace ID to the external ID list in the IAM policy, or else the source data cannot be synced to S3.
You must individually connect each source to the Data Lakes destination. However, you can copy the settings from another source by clicking…(“more”) (next to the button for “Set up Guide”).
(Optional)Glue Database Name: Optional advanced setting to change the name of the Glue Database which is set to the source slug by default. Each source connected to Data Lakes must have a different Glue Database name otherwise data from different sources will collide in the same database.
Once the Data Lakes destination is enabled, the first sync will begin approximately 2 hours later.
You will see event data andsync reportspopulated in S3 and Glue after the first sync successfully completes. However if aninsufficient permissionorinvalid settingis provided during set up, the first data lake sync will fail.
To receive sync failure alerts by email, subscribe to theStorage Destination Sync Failedactivity email notification within theApp Settings > User Preferences >Notification Settings.
Sync Failedemails are sent on the 1st, 5th, and 20th sync failure. Learn more about the types of errors which can cause sync failures in Segment’sSync errorsdocs.
If you want to add historical data to your data set using areplay of historical datainto Data Lakes,contact the Segment Support teamto request one.
Replay processing time can vary depending on the volume of data and number of events in each source. If you decide to run a Replay, Segment recommends that you start with data from the last six months to get started, and then replay additional data if you find you need more.
Segment creates a separate EMR cluster to run replays, then destroys it when the replay finishes. This ensures that regular Data Lakes syncs are not interrupted, and helps the replay finish faster.
To set up Segment Data Lakes (Azure), create your Azure resources and then enable the Data Lakes destination in the Segment app.
Before you can configure your Azure resources, you must complete the following prerequisites:
Before continuing, note the Location, Storage account name, and the Azure storage container name: you’ll need this information when configuring the Segment Data Lakes (Azure) destination in the Segment app.
Before continuing, note the MySQL server URL, username and password for the admin account, and your database name: you’ll need this information when configuring the Segment Data Lakes (Azure) destination in the Segment app.
Databricks pricing tier
If you create a Databricks instance only for Segment Data Lakes (Azure) usage, only the standard pricing tier is required. However, if you use your Databricks instance for other applications, you may require premium pricing.
Before continuing, note the Cluster ID, Workspace name, Workspace URL, and the Azure Resource Group for your Databricks Workspace: you’ll need this information when configuring the Segment Data Lakes (Azure) destination in the Segment app.
Before continuing, note the Client ID and Client Secret for your Service Principal: you’ll need this information when configuring the Segment Data Lakes (Azure) destination in the Segment app.
Optional configuration settings for log4j vulnerability
While Databricks released a statement that clusters are likely unaffected by the log4j vulnerability, out of an abundance of caution, Databricks recommends updating to log4j 2.15+ or adding the following options to the Spark configuration:spark.driver.extraJavaOptions "-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true"spark.executor.extraJavaOptions "-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true"
After you set up the necessary resources in Azure, the next step is to set up the Data Lakes destination in Segment:
Instead of manually configuring your Data Lake, you can create it using the script in theterraform-segment-data-lakesGitHub repository.
This script requires Terraform versions 0.12+.
Before you can run the Terraform script, create a Databricks workspace in the Azure UI using the instructions inStep 4 - Set up Databricks. Note theWorkspace URL, as you will need it to run the script.
In the setup file, set the following local variables:
After you’ve configured your local variables, run the following commands:
Running theplancommand gives you an output that creates 19 new objects, unless you are reusing objects in other Azure applications. Running theapplycommand creates the resources and produces a service principal password you can use to set up the destination.
No, Data Lakes automatically creates one Glue database per source. This database uses the source slug as its name.
Four roles are created when you set up Data Lakes using Terraform. You add thearn:aws:iam::$ACCOUNT_ID:role/segment-data-lake-iam-rolerole to the Data Lakes Settings page in the Segment web app.
The roles which Data Lakes assigns during set up are:
segment_emr_service_role- Restricted role that can only be assumed by the EMR service. This is set up based onAWS best practices.
The module doesn’t create a new S3 bucket so you can re-use an existing bucket for your Data Lakes.
Yes, the S3 bucket and the EMR cluster must be in the same region.
To connect a new source to Data Lakes:
Yes, you can configure multiple sources to use the same EMR cluster. Segment recommends that the EMR cluster only be used for Data Lakes to ensure there aren’t interruptions from non-Data Lakes job.
If you don’t see data after enabling a source, check the following:
If all of these look correct and you’re still not seeing any data, pleasecontact the Support team.
Theoutputtables are temporary tables Segment creates when loading data. They are deleted after each sync.
Yes, you can create new directories in S3 without interfering with Segment data.
Do not modify, or create additional directories with the following names:
Partitionedjust means that the table has partition columns (day and hour). All tables are partitioned, so you should see this on all table names.
You can use the following command to create external tables in Spectrum to access tables in Glue and join the data with Redshift:
Run theCREATE EXTERNAL SCHEMAcommand:
Replace:
Yes, your storage account and Databricks instance should be in the same region.
Segment Data Lakes (Azure) supports the following post-processing tools:
If you encounter errors related to your Databricks database, try adding the following line to the config:
After you’ve added to your config, restart your cluster so that your changes can take effect. If you continue to encounter errors,contact Segment Support.
Check your Spark configs to ensure that the information you entered about the database is correct, then restart the cluster. The Databricks cluster automatically initializes the Hive Metastore, so an issue with your config file will stop the table from being created.  If you continue to encounter errors,contact Segment Support.

Segment Data Lakes generates reports with operational metrics about each sync to your data lake so you can monitor sync performance. These sync reports are stored in your S3 bucket and Glue Data Catalog. This means you have access to the raw data, so you can query it to answer questions and set up alerting and monitoring tools.
Your sync_report table stores all of your sync data. You can query it to answer common questions about data synced to your data lake.
The table has the following columns in its schema:
The Glue Database named__segment_datalakestores the schema of thesync_reportstable. The__segment_datalakedatabase has the following format:
Thesync_reportstable is available in S3 and Glue only once a sync completes. Sync reports are not available for syncs in progress.
Data Lakes sync reports are stored in Glue and in S3.
Segment automatically creates a Glue Database and table when you set up Data Lakes to store all sync report tables. The Glue Database is named__segment_datalake, and the table is namedsync_reports.
The S3 structure is:s3://my-bucket/segment-data/reports/day=YYYY-MM-DD/source=$SOURCE_ID/run_id=$RUN_ID/report.json
The data in the sync reports is stored in JSON format to ensure that it is human-readable and can be processed by other systems.
Each table involved in the sync is a separate JSON object that contains the sync metrics for the data loaded to that table.
The example below shows the raw JSON object for asuccessfulsync report.
The example below shows the raw JSON object for afailedsync report.
You can use SQL to query your Sync Reports table to explore and analyze operational sync metrics.
A few helpful and commonly used queries are included below.
The following error types can cause your data lake syncs to fail:
If Data Lakes does not have the correct access permissions for S3, Glue, and EMR, your syncs will fail.
If permissions are the problem, you might see one of the following permissions-related error messages:
Check the set up guideto ensure that you set up the required permission configuration for S3, Glue and EMR.
One or more settings might be incorrectly configured in the Segment app, preventing your Data Lakes syncs from succeeding.
If you have invalid settings, you might see one of the error messages below:
The most common error occurs when you do not list all Source IDs in the External ID section of the IAM role. You can find your Source IDs in the Segment workspace, and you must add each one to the list ofExternal IDsin the IAM policy. You can either update the IAM policy from the AWS Console, or re-run theData Lakes set up Terraform job.
Internal errors occur in Segment’s internal systems, and should resolve on their own. If sync failures persist,contact the Segment Support team.
Both Warehouses and Data Lakes provide similar information about syncs, including the start and finish time, rows synced, and errors.
However, Warehouse sync information is only available in the Segment app: on the Sync History page and Warehouse Health pages. With Data Lakes sync reports, the raw sync information is sent directly to your data lake. This means you can query the raw data and answer your own questions about syncs, and use the data to power alerting and monitoring tools.
Sync reports are currently generated only when a sync completes, or when it fails. Partial failure reporting is not currently supported.

Lake Formation is a fully managed service built on top of the AWS Glue Data Catalog that provides one central set of tools to build and manage a Data Lake. These tools help import, catalog, transform, and deduplicate data, as well as provide strategies to optimize data storage and security. To learn more about Lake Formation features, seeAmazon Web Services documentation.
The security policies in Lake Formation use two layers of permissions: each resource is protected by Lake Formation permissions (which control access to Data Catalog resources and S3 locations) and IAM permissions (which control access to Lake Formation and AWS Glue API resources). When any user or role reads or writes to a resource, that action must pass a both a Lake Formation and an IAM resource check: for example, a user trying to create a new table in the Data Catalog may have Lake Formation access to the Data Catalog, but if they don’t have the correct Glue API permissions, they will be unable to create the table.
For more information about security practices in Lake Formation, see Amazon’sLake Formation Permissions Referencedocumentation.
You can configure Lake Formation using theIAMAllowedPrincipalsgroupor byusing IAM policies for access control. Configuring Lake Formation using theIAMAllowedPrincipalsgroup is an easier method, recommended for those exploring Lake Formation. Setting up Lake Formation using IAM policies for access control is a more advanced setup option, recommended for those who want additional customization options.
Permissions required to configure Data Lakes
To configure Lake Formation, you must be logged in to AWS with data lake administrator or database creator permissions.
To verify that you’ve configured Lake Formation, open theAWS Lake Formation service, selectData lake permissions, and verify theIAMAllowedPrincipalsgroup is listed with “All” permissions.
Granting Super permission to IAM roles
If you manually configured your database, assign theEMR_EC2_DefaultRoleSuper permissions in step 8. If you configured your database using Terraform, assign thesegment_emr_instance_profileSuper permissions in step 8.

The Segment Data Lakes sync history and health tabs generate real-time information about data syncs so you can monitor the health and performance of your data lakes. These tools provide monitoring and debugging capabilities within the Data Lakes UI, so you can identify and proactively address data sync or data pipeline failures.
The Sync History table shows detailed information about the latest 100 syncs to the data lake. The table includes the following fields:
Selecting a row in the Sync History table opens a sidebar showing the number of rows from each collection that synced.
To access the Sync History page from the Segment app, open theMy Destinationspage and select the data lake. On the data lakes Settings page, select theSync Historytab.
The health tab provides an overview of the rows that synced to your data lake both today and each day for the last 30 days.
The bar chart, ‘Daily Synced Rows,’ shows an overview of the rows synced for each of the last 30 days. Hovering over a date shows the number of rows that were synced for that day. Selecting a date from the bar chart opens the Daily Row Volume table, which provides a breakdown of which collections synced, how many rows from each collection synced, and the percentage of all synced rows from each collection.
The Daily Row Volume table contains the following information:
Above the Daily Row Volume table is an overview of the total syncs for the current day, showing the number of rows synced, the number of collections that synced, and the current date.
To access the Sync history page from the Segment app, open theMy Destinationspage and select the data lake. On the data lakes settings page, select theHealthtab.
The health tab shows an aggregate view of the last 30 days worth of data, while the sync history retains the last 100 syncs.
The sync history feature shows detailed information about the most recent 100 syncs to a data lake, while the health tab shows just the number of rows synced to the data lake over the last 30 days.
All dates and times on the sync history and health pages are in the user’s local time.
The sync data for both reports updates in real time.
Syncs occur approximately every two hours. Users cannot choose how frequently the data lake syncs.

As Segment builds new data storage products, each product evolves from prior products to best support the needs of customers. Segment Data Lakes is an evolution of the Warehouses product that meets the changing needs of customers.
Data Lakes and Warehouses are not identical, but are compatible with a configurable mapping. This mapping helps you to identify and manage the differences between the two storage solutions, so you can easily understand how the data in each is related.
Data Lakes and Warehouses offer different sync frequencies:
Segment’s99% guarantee of no duplicatesfor data within a 24 hour look-back window applies to data in Segment Data Lakes and Warehouses.
WarehousesandData Lakesalso have a secondary deduplication system to further reduce the volume of duplicates to ensure clean data in your Warehouses and Data Lakes.
Warehouses support both event and object data, while Data Lakes supports only event data.
See the table below for information about thesourcetypes supported by Warehouses and Data Lakes.
Warehouses and Data Lakes both infer data types for the events each receives. Since events are received by Warehouses one by one, Warehouses look at the first event received every hour to infer the data type for subsequent events. Data Lakes uses a similar approach, however because it receives data every hour, Data Lakes is able to look at a group of events to infer the data type.
This approach leads to a few scenarios where the data type for an event may be different between Warehouses and Data Lakes. Those scenarios are:
Variance in data types between Warehouses and Data Lakes don’t happen often for booleans, strings, and timestamps, however it can occur for decimals and integers.
If a bad data type is seen, such as text in place of a number or an incorrectly formatted date, Warehouses and Data Lakes attempt a best effort conversion to cast the fields to the target data type. Fields that cannot be casted may be dropped.Contact Segment Supportif you want to correct data types in the schema and perform areplayto ensure no data is lost.
Tables between Warehouses and Data Lakes will be the same, except for in these two cases:
Similar to tables, columns between Warehouses and Data Lakes will be the same, except for in a few specific scenarios:

Free and Team plan workspaces can have 1 warehouse. Business plans can have more than one, and include custom sync schedules and filtering.See theavailable plans, orcontact Support.
On this page
A warehouse is a central repository of data collected from one or more sources. This is what commonly comes to mind when you think about a relational database: structured data that fits neatly into rows and columns.
In Segment, a Warehouse is a special type of destination. Instead of streaming data to the destination all the time, we load data to them in bulk at regular intervals. When we load data, we insert and update events and objects, and automatically adjust their schema to fit the data you’ve sent to Segment.
When selecting and building a data warehouse, consider three questions:
Relational databases are great when you know and predefine the information collected and how it will be linked. This is usually the type of database used in the world of user analytics. For instance, a users table might be populated with the columnsname,email_address, orplan_name.
Examples of data warehouses include Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, and Postgres.
When Segment loads data into your warehouse, each sync goes through two steps:

Paragraphs:
On this page
Aschemadescribes the way that the data in a warehouse is organized. Segment stores data in relational schemas, which organize data into the following template:<source>.<collection>.<property>, for examplesegment_engineering.tracks.user_id, where source refers to the source or project name (segment_engineering), collection refers to the event (tracks), and the property refers to the data being collected (user_id). All schemas convert collection and property names fromCamelCasetosnake_caseusing thego-snakecasepackage.
Warehouse column creation
Note:Segment creates tables for each of your custom events in your warehouse, with columns for each event’s custom properties. Segment does not allow unboundedeventorpropertyspaces in your data. Instead of recording events like “Ordered Product 15”, use a single property of “Product Number” or similar.
Segment creates and populates a column only when it receives a non-null value from the source.
Segment’s libraries pass nested objects and arrays into tracking calls asproperties,traits, andtracking calls. To preserve the quality of your events data, Segment uses the following methods to store properties and traits in database tables:
The table below describes the schema in Segment Warehouses:
Theidentifiestable stores the.identify()method calls. Query it to find out user-level information. It has the following columns:
To see a list of the columns in theidentifiestable for your<source>, run the following:
Theidentifiestable is where you can query information about your users and their traits. For example, this query returns unique users you’ve seen on your site each day:
Thegroupstable stores thegroupmethod calls. Query it to find out group-level information. It has the following columns:
To see a list of the columns in thegroupstable for your<source>, run the following:
To see a list of the groups using your product, run the following:
Thepagesandscreenstables store thepageandscreenmethod calls. Query it to find out information about page views or screen views. It has the following columns:
To see a list of the columns in thepagestable for your<source>, run the following:
The pages table can give you interesting information about page views that happen on your site. The following query, for example, shows page views grouped by day:
Thetrackstable stores thetrackmethod calls. Query it to find out information about the events your users have triggered. It has the following columns:
Yourtrackstable is a rollup of the different event-specific tables, for quick querying of just a single type. For example, you could see the number of unique users signed up each day:
Your event tables are a series of table for each custom event you record to Segment. We break them out into their own tables because the properties, and, as a result, the columns, differ for each event. Query these tables to find out information about specific properties of your custom events. They have the following columns:
To see a list of the event tables for a given<source>, run the following:
To see a list of the columns in one of your event tables, run the following:
To see the tables for your organization, you can run this query:
Thesource.eventtables have the same columns as thesource.tracktables, but they also include columns specific to the properties of each event.
If you’re recording an event like:
Then you can expect to see columns namedplanandaccount_typeas well as the defaultevent,id, and so on. That way, you can write queries against any of the custom data sent in track calls.
Note
Because Segment addspropertiesandtraitsas un-prefixed columns to your tables, there is a chance the names can collide with the reserved column names. For this reason, Segment discards properties with the same name as the reserved column name (for example,user_id).
Your event tables are one of the more powerful datasets in Segment SQL. They allow you to see which actions users perform when interacting with your product.
Because every source has different events, what you can do with them will vary. Here’s an example where you can see the number of “Enterprise” users signed up for each day:
Here’s an example that queries the daily revenue for an ecommerce store:
New event properties and traits create columns. Segment processes the incoming data in batches, based on either data size or an interval of time. If the table doesn’t exist we lock and create the table. If the table exists but new columns need to be created, we perform a diff and alter the table to append new columns.
When Segment process a new batch and discover a new column to add, we take the most recent occurrence of a column and choose its datatype.
The data types that Segment currently supports include:
Data types are set up in your warehouse based on the first value that comes in from a source. For example, if the first value that came in from a source was a string, Segment would set the data type in the warehouse tostring.
In cases where a data type is determined incorrectly, the support team can help you update the data type. As an example, if a field can include float values as well as integers, but the first value we received was an integer, we will set the data type of the field to integer, resulting in a loss of precision.
To update the data type, reach out to the Segment support team. They will update the internal schema that Segment uses to infer your warehouse schema. Once the change is made, Segment will start syncing the data with the correct data type. However, if you want to backfill the historical data , you must drop the impacted tables on your end so that Segment can recreate them and backfill those tables.
To request data types changes, please reach out toSegment Supportfor assistance, and provide with these details for the affected columns in the following format:<schema_name>.<table_name>.<column_name>.<current_datatype>.<new_datatype>
After analyzing the data from dozens of customers, we set the string column length limit at 512 characters. Longer strings are truncated. We found this was the sweet spot for good performance and ignoring non-useful data.
Segment uses special-case compression for some known columns, like event names and timestamps. The others default to LZO. Segment may add look-ahead sampling down the road, but from inspecting the datasets today this would be unnecessarily complex.
The Segment API associates four timestamps with every call:timestamp,original_timestamp,sent_atandreceived_at.
All four timestamps pass through to your Warehouse for every ETL’d event. In most cases the timestamps are close together, but they have different meanings which are important.
timestampis the UTC-converted timestamp which is set by the Segment library. If you are importing historical events using a server-side library, this is the timestamp you’ll want to reference in your queries.
original_timestampis the original timestamp set by the Segment library at the time the event is created.  Keep in mind, this timestamp can be affected by device clock skew. You can override this value by manually passing in a value fortimestampwhich will then be relabeled asoriginal_timestamp. Generally, this timestamp should be ignored in favor of thetimestampcolumn.
sent_atis the UTC timestamp set by library when the Segment API call was sent.  This timestamp can also be affected by device clock skew.
received_atis UTC timestamp set by the Segment API when the API receives the payload from client or server. All tables usereceived_atfor the sort key.
Segment recommends using thereceived_attimestamp for all queries based on time. The reason for this is two-fold. First, thesent_attimestamp relies on a client’s device clock being accurate, which is generally unreliable. Secondly, Segment setsreceived_atas the sort key in Redshift schemas, which means queries will execute much faster when usingreceived_at. You can continue to usetimestamporsent_attimestamps in queries ifreceived_atdoesn’t work for your analysis, but the queries will take longer to complete.
For Business Tier customers, Segment suggests enablingreceived_atin the Selective Sync settings to ensure syncs and backfills complete successfully.
received_atdoes not ensure chronology of events.  For queries based on event chronology,timestampshould be used.
ISO-8601 date strings with timezones included are required when using timestamps withEngage. Sending custom traits without a timezone included in the timestamp will result in the value not being saved.
To learn more about timestamps in Segment,read our timestamps overviewin the Segment Spec.
Each row in your database will have anidwhich is equivalent to the messageId which is passed through in the raw JSON events. Theidis a unique message id associated with the row.
Theuuidcolumn is used to prevent duplicates. You can ignore this column.
Theuuid_tscolumn is used to keep track of when the specific event was last processed by our connector, specifically for deduping and debugging purposes. You can generally ignore this column.
Theloaded_atcolumn contains the UTC timestamp reflecting when the data was staged by the processor. This column is created only in BigQuery warehouse.
All tables usereceived_atfor the sort key. Amazon Redshift stores your data on disk in sorted order according to the sort key. The Redshift query optimizer uses sort order when it determines optimal query plans.

Paragraphs:
On this page
Instead of constantly streaming data to the warehouse destination, Segment loads data to the warehouse in bulk at regular intervals. Before the data loads, Segment inserts and updates events and objects, and automatically adjusts the schema to make sure the data in the warehouse is inline with the data in Segment.
When Segment loads data into your warehouse, each sync goes through two steps:
Warehouses sync with all data coming from your source. However, Business plan members can manage the data that is sent to their warehouses usingSelective Sync.
Your plan determines how frequently data is synced to your warehouse.
*If you’re a Business plan member and would like to adjust your sync frequency, you can do so using the Selective Sync feature. To enable Selective Sync, please go toWarehouse>Settings>Sync Schedule.
Why can't I sync more than 24 times per day?
We do not set syncs to happen more than once per hour (24 times per day). The warehouse product is not designed for real-time data, so more frequent syncs would not necessarily be helpful.
You can use the Sync History page to see the status and history of data updates in your warehouse. The Sync History page is available for every source connected to each warehouse. This page helps you answer questions like, “Has the data from a specific source been updated recently?” “Did a sync completely fail, or only partially fail?” and “Why wasn’t this sync successful?”
The Sync History includes the following information:
If a sync run shows a partial success or failure, the next sync attempts to sync any data that was not successfully synced in the prior run.
To view the Sync History:
Warehouse Selective Sync allows you to manage the data that you send to your warehouses. You can use this feature to stop syncing specific events (also known as collections) or properties that aren’t relevant, and may slow down your warehouse syncs.
This feature is only available to Business Tier customers.You must be a Workspace Owner to change Selective Sync settings.
With Selective Sync, you can customize which collections and properties from a source are sent to each warehouse. This helps you control the data that is sent to each warehouse, allowing you to sync different sets of data from the same source to different warehouses.
NOTE:This feature only affectswarehouses, and doesn’t prevent data from going to any otherdestinations.
When you disable a source, collection or property, Segment no longer syncs data from that source. Segment won’t delete any historical data from your warehouse. When you re-enable a source, Segment syncs all events since the last sync. This doesn’t apply when a collection or property is re-enabled. Only new data generated after re-enabling a collection or property will sync to your warehouse.
For each warehouse only the first 5,000 collections per source and 5,000 properties per collection are visible in the Selective Sync user interface.Learn more about the limits.
Disabling thereceived_atcolumn will cause your syncs to fail, as all tables usereceived_atas the sort key.
By default, all sources and their collections and properties are sent, and no data is prevented from reaching warehouses.
When you disable sources, collections, or properties using Selective Sync, Segment stops sending new data for these sources, collections, or properties to your warehouse. It doesn’t delete any existing data in the warehouse.
If you choose to re-enable a source to begin syncing again, Segment loads all data that arrived since the last sync into the warehouse, but doesn’t backfill data that was omitted while these were disabled. When a collection or property is re-enabled, data only syncs going forward. It will not be loaded from the last sync.
To use Selective Sync:
To change the sync settings to a single warehouse from multiple sources, follow the same steps asabove.
This may be valuable if you’re looking to make changes in bulk, such as when setting up a new warehouse.
To manage data from one specific source to an individual warehouse:
This may be valuable when you’re making smaller changes, for example, disabling all properties from one unnecessary collection.
All changes made through Selective Sync only impact an individual warehouse. They don’t impact multiple warehouses at once. To make changes to multiple warehouses, you need to enable/disable data for each individual warehouse.
Regardless of schema size, for each warehouse only the first 5,000 collections per source and 5,000 properties per collection can be managed using the Selective Sync user interface. After you hit any of these limits, all future data is still tracked and sent to your warehouse. New collections created after hitting this limit is not displayed in the Selective Sync table.
You will see a warning in the Selective Sync user interface when the warehouse schema has reached 80% of the limit for collections and/or properties. An error message will appear when you’ve reached the limit.
ContactSupportto edit Selective Sync settings for any collections and/or properties which exceed the limit.
Only Workspace Owners can change Selective Sync settings.

The Warehouse Health dashboard helps you understand trends in data volume (specifically, rows) synced to your data warehouse over time.
You can use this feature to answer questions such as:
Note: Warehouse Health is available for all Warehouse customers.
The Warehouse Health dashboards are available at both thewarehouse level, and at thewarehouse-source connection level, explained below.
Data in the dashboards updates in real-time, and covers the previous 30 days. The timezones displayed in the dashboards are converted to the viewer’s local time.
Go to the Segment App, to the Destinations list, and select the warehouse. On the warehouse’s information page, click theHealthtab.
This dashboard displays aggregate trends fromallsources that sync to the specific warehouse.
A warehouse level dashboard
Go to the Segment App, to the Destinations list, and select the warehouse. On the warehouse’s Overview page, select the Source (schema) you want to see data for, then click theHealthtab.
This dashboard displays trends for each separate source that syncs to a specific warehouse. It also displays aggregations of the collections within that source.
A warehouse-source level dashboard
No. These dashboards exist to help you understand high-level trends, but not to provide exact numbers about the data synced to the warehouse. The numbers provided in these dashboards are rounded, and are not exact.
These dashboards will help you understand trends in the data, and use signals to do deeper investigation and QA, as needed.
The Warehouse Overview, Sync History and Health tabs provide different levels of granularity into warehouse syncs.
Data is refreshed on a real time basis.
The data available shows the last 30 days.
All dates and times found within Warehouse Health, Sync History and Warehouse overview pages are in the user’s local time.

In most cases, you will get a much better price-to-performance ratio with Redshift for typical analyses.
Redshift lacks somefeatures,datatypes, andfunctionssupported by Postgres and also implementssome featuresdifferently. If you need any of the features or functions missing in Redshift and BigQuery, choose Postgres. If not (or you’re not sure), Segment recommends choosing Redshift.
If you’d like more information, Amazon wroteabout this in their documentation.
Both Redshift and BigQuery are attractive cloud-hosted, affordable, and performant analytical databases. The differences between the two are around their architecture and pricing.
When you provision a Redshift cluster, you’re renting a server from Amazon Web Services. Your cluster consists ofnodes, each with dedicated memory, CPU, and disk storage. These nodes handle data storage, query execution, and - if your cluster contains multiple nodes - a leader node will handle coordination across the cluster.
Redshift performance and storage capacity is a function of cluster size and cluster type. As your storage or performance requirements change, you can scale up or down your cluster as needed.
With BigQuery, you’re not constrained by the storage capacity or compute resources of a given cluster. Instead, you can load large amounts of data into BigQuery without running out of memory, and execute complex queries without maxing out CPU.
This is possible because BigQuery takes advantage of distributed storage and networking to separate data storage from compute power. Google’sColossus distributed file systemdistributes data across many servers in the Google cloud. When you execute a query, theDremel query enginesplits the query into smaller sub-tasks, distributes the sub-tasks to computers across Google data centers, and then re-assembles them into your results.
The difference in architecture translates into differences in pricing.
Redshift pricesare based on an hourly rate determined by the number and types of nodes in your cluster. They offer dense storage - optimized for storage - and dense compute nodes - optimized for query performance.
BigQuery has twopricing options: variable and fixed pricing. With the variable, pay-as-you-go plan, you pay for the data you load into BigQuery, and then pay for the amount of data you query. BigQuery allows you to set upCost Controls and Alertsto help control and monitor costs.
Fixed-price plans are more for high-volume customers and allow you to rent a fixed amount of compute power.
Redshift does require you to create a cluster, choose sort and distribution keys, and resize your cluster as storage and performance needs change over time.
BigQuery is “fully-managed”, which means that you’ll never have to resize or adjust distribution or sort keys. BigQuery handles all of that.

Yes. Customers on Segment’sBusiness plancan choose which sources, collections, and properties sync to your data warehouse usingWarehouse Selective Sync.
Selective Sync helps manage the data Segment sends to each warehouse, allowing you to sync different sets of data from the same source to different warehouses.
When you disable a source, collection or property, Segment no longer syncs data from that source. Segment won’t delete any historical data from your warehouse. When you re-enable a source, Segment syncs all events since the last sync. This doesn’t apply when a collection or property is re-enabled. Only new data generated after re-enabling a collection or property will sync to your warehouse.
You can also use theIntegration Objectto control whether or not data is sent to a specific warehouse.
You have full admin access to your Segment Warehouse. However, don’t tweak or delete Segment generated tables, as this may cause problems for the systems that upload new data.
If you want to join across additional datasets, feel free to create and upload additional tables.
This is a common question if the data you’re collecting has evolved over time. For example, if you used to track the eventSignupbut now trackSigned Up, you’d probably like to merge those two tables to make querying simple and understandable.
Segment does not have a way to update the event data in the context of your warehouse to retroactively merge the tables created from changed events. Instead, you can create a “materialized” view of the unioned events. This is supported inRedshift,Postgres,Snowflake, and others, but may not be available inallwarehouses.
Protocols customers can also useTransformationsto change events at the source, which applies to all cloud-mode destinations (destinations that receive data from the Segment servers)includingyour data warehouse. Protocols Transformations offer an excellent way to quickly resolve implementation mistakes and help transition events to a Segment spec.
Note: Transformations are currently limited to event, property and trait name changes, and donotapply to historical data.
Yes. Data types are initially set up in your warehouse based on the first value that comes in from a source, but you can request data type changes by reaching out toSegment supportfor assistance.
Keep in mind that Segment only usesgeneral data typeswhen loading data in your warehouse. Therefore, some of the common scenarios are:
More granular changes (such as the examples below) wouldn’t normally be handled by the Support team, thus they often need to be made within the warehouse itself:
The data type definitions in Protocols have no impact on the warehouse schema.
Your source slug can be found in the URL when you’re looking at the source destinations page or live debugger. The URL structure will look like this:
https://segment.com/[my-workspace]/sources/[my-source-slug]/overview
Your warehouse id appears in the URL when you look at thewarehouse destinations page. The URL structure looks like this:
app.segment.com/[my-workspace]/warehouses/[my-warehouse-id]/overview
Data is available in Warehouses within 24-48 hours, depending on your tier’s sync frequency. For more information about sync frequency by tier, seeSync Frequency.
Real-time loading of the data into Segment Warehouses would cause significant performance degradation at query time. To optimize for your query speed, reliability, and robustness, Segment guarantees that your data will be available in your warehouse within 24 hours. The underlying datastore has a subtle tradeoff between data freshness, robustness, and query speed. For the best experience, Segment needs to balance all three of these.
You can freely load data into your Segment Warehouse to join against your source data tables.
The only restriction when loading your own data into your connected warehouse is that you should not add or remove tables within schemas generated by Segment for your sources. Those tables have a naming scheme of<source-slug>.<table>and should only be modified by Segment. Arbitrarily deleting columns from these tables may result in mismatches upon load.
If you want to insert custom data into your warehouse, create new schemas that are not associated with an existing source, since these may be deleted upon a reload of the Segment data in the cluster.
Segment recommends scripting any sort of additions of data you might have to warehouse, so that you aren’t doing one-off tasks that can be hard to recover from in the future in the case of hardware failure.
Segment recommends enabling IP allowlists for added security. All Segment users with workspaces hosted in the US who use allowlists in their warehouses must update those allowlists to include the following ranges:
Users with workspaces in the EU must allowlist3.251.148.96/29.
Segment loads up to two months of your historical data when you connect a warehouse.
For full historical backfills you’ll need to be a Segment Business plan customer. If you’d like to learn more about our Business plan and all the features that come with it,check out our pricing page.
Heroku’s simple set up and administration process make it a great option to get up and running quickly.
Amazon’s service has some more powerful features and will be more cost-effective for most cases. However, first time users of Amazon Web Services (AWS) will likely need to spend some time with the documentation to get set up properly.
When you create a new source, the source syncs to all warehouse(s) in the workspace by default. You can prevent the source from syncing to some or all warehouses in the workspace in two ways:
After a source is created, you can enable or disable a warehouse sync within the Warehouse Settings page.
If you enabled activity notifications for your storage destination, you’ll receive notifications in the Segment app for the fifth and 20th consecutive warehouse failures for all incoming data. Segment does not track failures on a per connection (‘source<>warehouse’) basis. Segment’s notification structure also identifies global issues encountered when connecting to your warehouse, like bad credentials or being completely inaccessible to Segment.
To sign up for warehouse sync notifications:
Data in your warehouse is formatted intoschemas, which involve a detailed description of database elements (tables, views, indexes, synonyms, etc.)
and the relationships that exist between elements. Segment’s schemas use the following template:<source>.<collection>.<property>, for example,segment_engineering.tracks.user_id, where source refers to the source or project name (segment_engineering), collection refers to the event (tracks),
and the property refers to the data being collected (user_id).Note:It is not possible to have different sources feed data into the same schema in your warehouse. While setting up a new schema, you cannot use a duplicate schema name.
Schema data for Segment warehouses is represented in snake case.
For more information about Warehouse Schemas, see theWarehouse Schemaspage.
If your syncs fail, you do not need to reach out to Segment Support to request a backfill. Once a successful sync takes place,
Segment automatically loads all of the data generated since the last successful sync occurred.
Segment stores the name of your schema in theSQL Settingspage. Changing the name of your schema in the app without updating the name in your data warehouse causes a new schema to form, one that doesn’t contain historical data.
To change the name of your schema without disruptions:
Note: This will set the schema name for all existing and future destinations. The new name must be lowercase and may include underscores.
At the moment, there isn’t a way to selectively filter events that are sent to the warehouse. The warehouse connector works quite differently from our streaming destinations and only has theselective syncfunctionality that allows you to enable/disable specific properties or events.
It’s not possible for different sources to sync data directly to the same schema in your warehouse. When setting up a new schema within the Segment UI, you can’t use a schema name that’s already in use by another source. Segment recommends syncing the data separately and then joining it downstream in your warehouse.
For more information about Warehouse Schemas, see theWarehouse Schemaspage.

Paragraphs:
If you have more than one person working with your Segment Warehouse, you might want to create users for your team so that each person can have a discrete login. The three steps in this section will show you how to create a user, grant usage on a schema and then grant the privileges that the user will need to interact with that schema.
The code above in [] is optional, you don’t need to group your users or give their credentials an expiration date, the code works without it. However, if you do choose to use those parameters,<abstime>should be formatted as ‘2015-09-13’ which translates to September 13th, 2015.
For instance, you can create a user namedflashtheslothas
This creates a user, you can run the following to get a list of users in your database.
Now that we’ve confirmed that the user has been created, they already have access to the public schema that contains systems-level information about the cluster but we need to give them access to the specific schemas that they’ll be working in.
Next,GRANT USAGEon the schema to the user we just created
The above SQL command grants the user USAGE privileges on a schema. Let’s assume you want to grantflashtheslothaccess to your development schema, it would look like below
Our new user now has usage rights on thedevelopmentschema, now we need to grant the type of SQL commands they’ll be able to run against the cluster. For the purposes of this example, we’re going to give the user read only privileges.
GRANT SELECTprivileges so the user can query the tables
The above SQL command grants the user SELECT rights on all tables in the chosen schema. For ourflashtheslothuser and thedevelopmentschema, it would look like below.
Doing these three steps will result in a new user that can query all the tables in a given schema. If you want to give access to more than one schema then you can simply repeat steps 2 and 3 for each additional schema. If you have any questions or if you’re running into any issues getting this set up,contact us.

Paragraphs:

“Are there limitations of Redshift clusters and our Redshift connector?”
While Redshift clusters are incredibly scalable and efficient, limitations are imposed to ensure that clusters maintain performance.
Redshift does not allow you to create tables or columns using reserved words. To avoid naming convention issues, we prepend a_to any reserved word names. If you’re having trouble finding a column or table, you can check the list ofRedshift reserved wordsor search for the table with a prepended underscore like_open.
Redshift sets the maximum number of tables you can create in a cluster to 9,900 including temporary tables. While it’s rare to reach that limit, we recommend keeping an eye on the number of tables our warehouse connector is creating in your cluster. Keep in mind that a new table is created for each unique event you send to Segment, which becomes an issue if events are being dynamically generated.
When setting up your Redshift cluster, you can select between dense storage (ds2) and dense compute (dc1) cluster types. Dense compute nodes are SSD based which allocates only 200GB per node, but results in faster queries. Dense storage nodes are hard disk based which allocates 2TB of space per node, but result in slower queries. When scaling up your cluster by adding nodes, it’s important to remember that adding more nodes will not add space linearly. As you add more dc1 nodes, the amount of preallocated space for each table increases. For example, if you have a table with 10 columns, Redshift will preallocate 20mb of space (10 columns X 2 slices) per node. That means that the same table will preallocate 20mb of space in a single ds2 cluster, and 200mb in a 10 node dc1 cluster.
Like with most data warehouses, column data types (string, integer, float, etc.) must be defined at the time the column is created. Unlike most data warehouses, Redshift does not allow for easy column type changes after the column has been created. Additionally, we store a record of what the tables and column types should be set to in a local database, and validate the structure on each connector run. Currently, column type changes (i.e. change an integer column to float) are only available to our business tier customers on an ad-hoc basis.
All Segment-managed schemas have a default VARCHAR size of 512 in order to keep performance high. If you wish to increase the VARCHAR size, you can run the following query.
Example:
Increasing the default size can impact query performance as it needs to process more data to accomodate the increased column size. SeeAmazon’s Redshift Documentationfor more details.
While almost all event properties are valid, we are unable to pass through properties that have naming conflicts with the default key/value pairs included in a standard raw JSON call. For example, if you send through a property in a track call named “timestamp” or “event”, it will cause a conflict and you likely wont see it appear in your warehouse. To be more specific, if you send the following track call, {‘event’:’birthday’} will likely be dropped when syncing the data to your data warehouse.
analytics.track('selected gift', {'event':'birthday', 'type':'cake'})

Waiting minutes and minutes, maybe even an hour, for your queries to compute is an unfortunate reality for growing companies. Whether your data has grown faster than your cluster, or you’re running too many jobs in parallel, there are lots of reasons your queries might be slowing down.
To help you improve your query performance, this guide takes you through common issues and how to mitigate them.
As your data volume grows and your team writes more queries, you might be running out of space in your cluster.
To check if you’re getting close to your max, run this query. It will tell you the percentage of storage used in your cluster. Segment recommends that you don’t exceed 75-80% of your storage capacity. If you approach that limit, consider adding more nodes to your cluster.
Learn how to resize your cluster.
Another thing you’ll want to check is if your queries are efficient. For example, if you’re scanning an entire dataset with a query, you’re probably not making the best use of your compute resources.
Some tips for writing performant queries:
Consider usingINNER joinsas they are more efficient thanLEFT joins.
Stay away fromUNIONwhenever possible.
Specify multiple levels of conditionals when you can.
UseEXPLAINto show the query execution plan and cost.

Some databases like Redshift have limited computing resources. Running multiple queries or ETL processes that insert data into your warehouse at the same time will compete for compute power.
If you have multiple ETL processes loading into your warehouse at the same time, especially when analysts are also trying to run queries, everything will slow down. Try to schedule them at different times and when your cluster is least active.
If you’re a Segment Business Tier customer, you can schedule your sync times under Warehouses Settings.

You also might want to take advantage of Redshift’sWorkload Managementthat helps ensure fast-running queries won’t get stuck behind long ones.
As mentioned before, Redshift schedules and prioritizes queries usingWorkload Management. Each queue is configured to distribute resources in ways that can optimize for your use-case.
The default configuration is a single queue with only 5 queries running concurrently, but Segment discovered that the default only works well for low-volume warehouses. More often than not, adjusting this configuration can improve your sync times.
Before Segment’s SQL statements, Segment usesset query_group to "segment";to group all the queries together. This allows you to create a queue that isolates Segment’s queries from your own. The maximum concurrency that Redshift supports is 50 acrossallquery groups, and resources like memory distribute evenly across all those queries.
Segment’s initial recommendation is for 2 WLM queues:
a queue for thesegmentquery group with a concurrency of10
leave the default queue with a concurrency of5

Generally, Segment is responsible for most writes in the databases Segment connects to, so having a higher concurrency allows Segment to write as fast as possible. If you’re also using the same database for your own ETL process, you may want to use the same concurrency for both groups. You may even require additional queues if you have other applications writing to the database.
Each cluster may have different needs, so feel free to stray from this recommendation if another configuration works better for your use-case. AWS provides someguidelines, and you can alwayscontact usas Segment is more than happy to share the learnings while working with Redshift.
In addition to following performance best practices, here are a some more optimizations to consider if you’re using Segment Warehouses.
When Segment is actively loading data into your data warehouse, Segment is competing for cluster space and storage with any other jobs you might be running. Here are the parameters that influence your load time for Segment Warehouses.
To make sure you have enough headroom for quick queries while using Segment Warehouses, here are some tips!
Hopefully these steps will help to speed up your workflow! If you need any other help, feel free tocontact us.

Below you’ll find a library of some of the most useful SQL queries customers use in their Redshift warehouses. You can run these in your Redshift instance with little to no modification.
If you’re looking to improve the speed of your queries, check out Segment’sSpeeding Up Redshift Queriespage.
You can use SQL queries for the following tasks:
If you’re looking for SQL queries for warehouses other than Redshift, check out some of Segment’sAnalyzing with SQL guides.
The Track call allows you to record any actions your users perform. A Track call takes three parameters: the userId, the event, and any optional properties.
Here’s a basic Track call:
A completed order Track call might look like this:
Each Track call is stored as a distinct row in a single Redshift table calledtracks. To get a table of your completed orders, you can run the following query:
That SQL query returns a table that looks like this:

But why are there columns in the table that weren’t a part of the Track call, likeevent_id? 
This is because the Track method (for client-side libraries) includes additional properties of the event, likeevent_id,sent_at, anduser_id!
If you want to know how many orders were completed over a span of time, you can use thedate()andcountfunction with thesent_attimestamp:
That query returns a table like this:
To see the number of pants and shirts that were sold on each of those dates, you can query that using case statements:
That query returns a table like this:
Segment’s API does not impose any restrictions on your data with regard to user sessions.
Sessions aren’t fundamental facts about the user experience. They’re stories Segment builds around the data to understand how customers actually use the product in their day-to-day lives. And since Segment’s API is about collecting raw, factual data, there’s no API for collecting sessions. Segment leaves session interpretation to SQL partners, which let you design how you measure sessions based on how customers use your product.
For more on why Segment doesn’t collect session data at the API level,check out a blog post here.
Each of Segment’s SQL partners allow you to define sessions based on your specific business needs. WithLooker, for example, you can take advantage of their persistent derived tables and LookML modeling language to layer sessionization on top of your Segment SQL data. Segment recommendschecking out Looker’s approach here.
To define sessions with raw SQL, a great query and explanation comes fromMode Analytics.
Here’s the query to make it happen, but read Mode Analytics’blog postfor more information. Mode walks you through the reasoning behind the query, what each portion accomplishes, how you can tweak it to suit your needs, and the kinds of further analysis you can add on top of it.
The Identify method ties user attributes to auserId.
As these user traits change over time, you can continue calling the Identify method to update their changes. With this query, you can update Bob’s account plan to “Premium”.
Each Identify call is stored in a single Redshift table calledidentifies. To see how a user’s plan changes over time, you can run the following query:
This SQL query returns a table of Bob’s account information, with each entry representing the state of his account at different time periods:
If you want to see what your users looked like at a previous point in time, you can find that data in theidentifiestable. To get this table for your users, replace ‘initech’ in the SQL query with your source slug.
If you only want the current state of the users, convert theidentifiestable into adistinct users tableby returning the most recent Identify call for each account.
The following query returns theidentifiestable:
That query returns a table like this:
If all you want is a table of distinct user with their current traits and without duplicates, you can do so with the following query:
Let’s say you have anidentifiestable that looks like this:
If you want to query the traits of these users, you first need toconvert the identifies table into a users table. From there, run a query like this to get a count of users with each type of plan:
And there you go: a count of users with each type of plan!
Thegroupmethod ties a user to a group. It also lets you record custom traits about the group, like the industry or number of employees.
Here’s what a basicgroupcall looks like:
As these group traits change over time, you can continue calling the group method to update their changes.
Each group call is stored as a distinct row in a single Redshift table calledgroups. To see how a group changes over time, you can run the following query:
The previous query will return a table of Initech’s group information, with each entry representing the state of the account at different times.
If you want to see a group’s traits at a previous point in time, this query is useful (To get this table for your groups, replace ‘initech’ with your source slug).
If you only want to see the most recent state of the group, you can convert the groups table into a distinct groups table by viewing the most recent groups call for each account.
The following query will return your groups table:
The previous query returns the following table:
However, if all you want is a table of distinct groups and current traits, you can do so with the following query:
This query will return a table with your distinct groups, without duplicates.

Segment has an Event Tester that enables you to test your connections between Segment and your destination. You can access the Event Tester from your Source Debugger, or from your destination settings.
Available for server-side event streaming destinations only
This feature is only available for server-side integrations (also known as cloud-mode destinations). You can’t use this for client-side integrations (also known as device-mode destinations).
There are two scenarios where you might want to use the Event Tester:
1. Choose an event from the Source Debugger that you want to debug and select “Validate”
Go to your Source Debugger, select an event and in the top right hand side of the debugger view, select “Validate”.

2. Choose the destination you want to test with
Select the destination that you want to test this event with. At this time, you can only use the Event Tester for cloud-mode (server side) destinations.

3. Send event to destination
The event payload from your debugger that you just selected will automatically load in the JSON view. You have the option to edit the payload if you want. Assuming it looks good, select “Send Event” at the bottom right of the screen.

4. Ensure you’re happy to send the test event to the destination
This is a real event that will appear in your end tool alongside your existing data. If you’re not comfortable with this, then select “Cancel” and do not send the event.

5. View the Partner API response
On the right hand side of the Event Tester you will see the response from the partner API. At the top, Segment provide of summary of the response. Below is the raw response payload Segment received that you can use for further debugging if necessary.

If you are receiving an error and are unsure how to fix the issue, visit the partner docs (for examplehttps://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v3/errors) or contact the partner support team.
The Event Tester is only accessible to users with write access in their Segment workspace (read-only users will not see the Event Tester in their workspace).
If you experience an error,let Segment knowand the Segment team will help you troubleshoot the issue.
The Event Tester is not available for Data Lakes.
Events passed into the Event Tester bypass destination filters. Destination filters are applied to events as they are sent to specific destinations. However, the Event Tester is designed to help you troubleshoot your Sources, their configuration, and their downstream destinations by showing a sample of the data available. It allows you to check that data is being sent, and that it’s in the correct format without the filters being applied. This means that when you use the Event Tester, you’re seeing the data before any destination filters or other processing rules are applied, providing a clear view of the raw event data as it comes from the source.

Paragraphs:
There are a few ways to export your Segment data. SegmentBusiness customershave the most data flexibility, but our self-service customers also have options.
Customers on ourbusiness plancan take advantage of Replay when they change vendors or add a vendor to their marketing and analytics stack.
When you want to trial or start using a new vendor, Segment canreplayyour timestamped, historical data so it’s like you’ve been using that app all along.
Replay works for all server-side destinations that have or accept timestamps, including our Amazon S3 destination, so you can get all your data history since the first event you sent to Segment.
If you are on any of our plans, there are multiple options available to you to gain access to your raw data.
All customers can connect adata warehouseto Segment – Free and Team customers can connect one, while Business customers can connect as many as they need. We translate and load your raw data logs into your warehouse for more powerful analysis in SQL.
We store all your API calls as line-separated JSON objects in Amazon S3. If youenable Amazon S3in your destinations catalog, we will copy the same data to your own S3 bucket. The data copied will only include data sent to Segment after you turn on the destination. Read ourAmazon S3 docsto learn more about how we structure that data.
You can use ourwebhooks destinationto fire off requests in realtime to an endpoint that you would need to spin up and manage on your side. This is basically re-creating how our business system works but takes a bit of work on your side. If your event volume is high it can be difficult to keep a server up to receive those messages in realtime.
Another one of our destinations isIron.io. They function similar to webhooks, but they will manage the message queue and allow you to run scripts on your data before routing it to another end point. Again this is similar to what Segment does for our business customers, but will require a decent amount of work from your team, however it will be much more reliable if your event volume gets high.
This option is the most restrictive but might be the easiest if you need only basic data to be exported. A few examples would be to use the reporting APIsClickyorGoogle Analyticsprovide (after turning those tools on in Segment and sending them data). Those APIs aren’t super flexible and you won’t see all the data from Segment, but for basic metrics they should work. One tool that’s a bit more flexible when it comes to a reporting API isKeen.io, which is also available on the Segment platform.

The Event Delivery tool helps you understand if data is reaching your destinations, and also helps you to see if Segment encountered any issues delivering your source data.
Segment sends billions of events to destinations every week. If Segment encounters any errors when attempting to deliver your data, Segment reports them in the Event Delivery tool.
Available for server side event streaming destinations only
This feature is only available for server side integrations (also known as cloud-mode destinations). You will not be able to use this for client side integrations (also known as device-mode destinations) because device-mode data is sent directly to the destination tool’s API. In order to report on deliverability, the data must be sent to destinations using a server side connection.
Not available for Warehouses or Amazon S3. These destinations work differently from other destinations in Segment, and aren’t supported at this time.
Here’s an example of what the Event Delivery tool looks like:

Scenarios when this tool will be useful:
Event Delivery can be accessed within any supported destination in the App. It’s located on the tab under “Settings” for each destination.

The UI consists of three key parts that report on Segment’s ability to deliver your source data - Key Metrics, Error Details, and Delivery Trends. Reporting on core functionality from top to bottom:
There’s a drop down menu to select your time period. All of the UI is updated based on the time period you select.

From left to right in the above graphic:
Delivered:This tells you the number of messages Segment successfully delivered to a destination in the time period you selected.
Not Delivered:This count tells you the number of messages Segment was unable to deliver. If this number is higher than zero, you will see the reasons for this failure in the errors table below.
P95 Latency:This is the time it takes for Segment to deliver the slowest 5% of your data (known as P95 latency). The latency reported is end-to-end: the event being received through the Segment API to the event being delivered to partner API. This helps tell you if there is a delay in your data and how bad it is.
The purpose of the table is to provide you a summary of the different errors we’ve seen in a given period and the most important information on them. All of the rows in the table are clickable and expand to give you more information.

View Segment’s list ofIntegration Error Codesfor more information about what might cause an error.
When there’s an error, Segment wants to give you as much information as possible to help you resolve the issue. See below for an example of what this view looks like.

This view includes:
The event delivery UI provides a human-friendly summary of the error, based on the payload Segment received back from the partner.
These are actions you can take, based on what Segment knows about the issue.
This section displays links to any documentation that might be helpful to you.
To help you debug, Segment provides sample payloads from every step of the data’s journey:
You Sent- the data you sent to Segment’s API.
Request to Destination- the request Segment made to the Partner API. This payload will likely be different from what you sent it because Segment is mapping your event to the partner’s spec to ensure the message is successfully delivered.
Response from Destination- the response Segment received from the Partner API. This will have the raw partner error. If you need to troubleshoot an issue with a Partner’s Success team, this is usually something they’ll want to see.
You can opt in to receive email alerts regarding failed events/syncs by going to your workspaace Settings > User Preferences > Activity Notifications > Destiantions. Then you can select the option to be alerted by Email and/or In-app.
When debugging, it’s helpful to see when issues start, stop, and trend over time.

Delivered: The number of events that were successfully delivered in the time period you selected.
Not delivered: The number of events that were not successfully delivered in the time period you selected.
How P95 latency has trended over the time period you selected.

Paragraphs:
On this page
Delivery Overview is a visual observability tool designed to help Segment users diagnose event delivery issues for any cloud-streaming destination receiving events from cloud-streaming sources.
Delivery Overview for RETL destinations and Engage Audience Syncs currently in development
This means that Segment is actively developing Delivery Overview features for RETL destinations and Engage Audience syncs. Some functionality may change before Delivery Overview for these integrations becomes generally available.
Delivery Overview is generally available for streaming connections (cloud-streaming sources and cloud-streaming destinations) and in public beta for storage destinations. Some metrics specific to storage destinations, like selective syncs, failed row counts, and total rows seen, are not yet available. 
All users of Delivery Overview have access to the Event Delivery tab, and can configure delivery alerts for their destinations.
Delivery Overview has three core features:
You can refine these tables using the time picker and the metric toggle, located under the destination header. With the time picker, you can specify a time period (last 10 minutes, 1 hour, 24 hours, 7 days, 2 weeks, or a custom date range over the last two weeks) for which you’d like to see data. With the metric toggle, you can switch between seeing metrics represented as percentages (for example,85% of eventsora 133% increase in events) or as counts (13 eventsoran increase of 145 events.) Delivery Overview shows percentages by default.
The pipeline view provides insights into each step your data is processed by enroute to the destination, with an emphasis on the steps where data can be discarded due to errors or your filter preferences. Each step provides details into counts, change rates, and event details (like the associated Event Type or Event Names), and the discard steps (Failed on ingest, Filtered at source, Filtered at destination, & Failed delivery) provide you with the reasons events were dropped before reaching the destination. Discard steps also include how to control or alter that outcome, when possible. The pipeline view also includes a label between the Filtered at destination and Failed delivery steps indicating how many events are currently pending retry.
Lookback window
Delivery Overview applies a 5-minute lookback period to provide stable, accurate metrics across all pipeline steps. This interval accounts for processing delays and ensures the data Segment displays reflects a reliable snapshot of recent events.
The pipeline view for classic destinations includes the following steps:
The pipeline view for Actions destination includes the following steps:

The pipeline view for storage destination includes the following steps:
The following image shows a storage destination with 23 partially successful syncs:

The breakdown table provides you with greater detail about the selected events.
To open the breakdown table, select either the first step in the pipeline view, the last step in the pipeline view, or select a discard step and then click on a discard reason.
The breakdown table displays the following details:
1:Segment calculates the related change percentage by subtracting the percent of events impacted in the previous time period from the percent of impacted events in the current time period. For example, if last week 15% of your events were filtered at a source, but this week, 22% of your events were filtered at a source, you would have a related change percentage of 7%.
The discard table provides you with greater detail about the events that failed to deliver or were filtered out of your sources and destinations.
To open the discard table, click on one of the discard steps. If you click on a row in the discard table, you can see the breakdown table for the discarded events.
The discard table displays the following details:
1:Segment calculates the related change percentage by subtracting the percent of events impacted in the previous time period from the percent of impacted events in the current time period. For example, if last week 15% of your events were filtered at a source, but this week, 22% of your events were filtered at a source, you would have a related change percentage of 7%.
Delivery Overview is useful to diagnose delivery errors in the following scenarios:
Delivery Overview in Engage Destinations
Because Engage uses sources for multiple purposes, you can expect to seefiltered at destinationevents with the integrations object in destinations linked to Engage. Engage uses the integrations object to route events to destinations you’ve added to your audiences, traits, and journey steps. As a result, some events aren’t meant to be delivered by the destination, so the integrations object filters them.
To view the Delivery Overview page:
To use Delivery Overview:
With Source Debugger or Event Delivery, you can only verify that events are successfully making it from your source or to your destination. If events fail, you have to troubleshoot to see where in the pipeline your events are getting stuck. With Event Tester, you can verify that your event makes it from your source to your destination, but if the results aren’t what you expected, you’re stuck troubleshooting your source, filters, tracking plans, and destinations.
With Delivery Overview, you can verify that your source receives your events, that any filters and tracking plans work as expected, and that events successfully make it to your destination. Any errors or unexpected behavior can be identified using the pipeline view, leading to quicker resolution.
You can use the Event Delivery alerting features (Delivery Alerts) by selecting theAlertstab in the destination header. Once you enable alerts, if the successful delivery rate of all events is less than the threshold percentage in the last 24 hours, you’ll be notified through in-app notification and/or workspace email.
Note that this is dependent on yournotification settings. For example, if the threshold is set to 99%, then you’ll be notified each time less than 100% of events fail.
You can also useConnections Alerting, a feature that allows Segment users to receive in-app, email, and Slack notifications related to the performance and throughput of an event-streaming connection.
Connections Alerting allows you to create two different alerts:
The data in Delivery Overview has an expected latency of approximately 30 seconds after event ingestion, but this may vary, depending on the features you’ve enabled in your workspace and spikes in volume. Segment delays the data visible in the Delivery Overview UI by 5 minutes to allow for more precise metric correlation. Segment does not impose the 5 minute delay if you access data using the Public API.
Similar to Segment’sEvent Deliveryfeature, the Delivery Overview page is only available for server-side integrations (also known as cloud-mode destinations). You won’t be able to use the Delivery Overview page for client side integrations (also known as device-mode destinations) because device-mode data is sent directly to the destination tool’s API. In order to report on deliverability, data must be sent to destinations using a server-side connection.
The Delivery Overview pipeline steps Failed on Ingest, Filtered at Source, Filtered at Destination, and Failed Delivery display adiscard tablewith information about why your events failed or were discarded.
This table provides a list of all possible discard reasons available at each pipeline step.

Paragraphs:
On this page
Connections Alerting allows Segment users to receive in-app, email, and Slack notifications related to the performance and throughput of an event-streaming connection.
To access Connections Alerting, select an event-streaming connection (like a web library source or cloud mode destination) and click theAlertstab.
On the Alerts tab, you can create alerts and view all active alerts for this connection. You can only edit or delete the alerts that you create.
You can create an alert that notifies you when the volume of events received by your source in the last 24 hours changes beyond a percentage you set. For example, if you set a change percentage of 4% and your source received 100 events over the first 24 hours, Segment would notify you the following day if your source ingested fewer than 96 or more than 104 events.
To receive a source volume alert in a Slack channel, you must first create a Slack webhook. For more information about Slack webhooks, see theSending messages using incoming webhooksdocumentation.

To create a source volume alert:
To make changes to a source volume alert, select the icon in the Actions column for the alert and clickEdit.
To delete a source volume alert, select the icon in the Actions column for the alert and clickDelete.
Deleting alerts created by other users requires Workspace Owner permissions
All users can delete source volume alerts that they created, but only those with Workspace Owner permissions can delete alerts created by other users.
You can create an alert that notifies you when the volume of events successfully received by your destination in the last 24 hours falls below a percentage you set. For example, if you set a percentage of 99%, Segment notifies you if your destination had a successful delivery rate of 98% or below.
To receive a successful delivery rate alert in a Slack channel, you must first create a Slack webhook. For more information about Slack webhooks, see theSending messages using incoming webhooksdocumentation.
To create a successful delivery rate alert:
To make changes to a successful delivery rate alert, select the icon in the Actions column for the alert and clickEdit.
To delete a successful delivery rate alert, select the icon in the Actions column for the alert and clickDelete.
Deleting alerts created by other users requires Workspace Owner permissions
All users can delete successful delivery alerts that they created, but only those with Workspace Owner permissions can delete alerts created by other users.
Segment generates delivery alerts for failed deliveries and successful deliveries, which are the last two stages of the delivery pipeline. As a result, alerts are based on Segment’s attempts to send qualified events to your destination, excluding those filtered out by business rules (like protocols, destination filters, or mappings).

Paragraphs:
On this page
The write key is a unique identifier for each source. It lets Segment know which source is sending the data and which destinations should receive that data.
To find a write key, you first need to create anevent streams sourcelike a website, server, or mobile source. (Cloud-sourcesdo not have write keys, as they use a token or key from your account with that service.)
Then, in the Source, go toSettingsand selectAPI Keys.

Now you can add the source’s write key to your app and begin sending data to Segment.
To find the source given a write key within your workspace, open your workspace and select the search icon. Enter your write key into the search bar. If the write key exists in the workspace and is connected to a source, the source shows up in the list of results.

This method is only available to locate event streams sources
This method cannot be used to find a destination or cloud event source.

On this page
These limits were updated on January 25, 2024.
Events ingested by Segment have a limit of10,000properties per individual event received. For example, two Track events named “Page Viewed” and “Signup completed” each have their own limit. Segment will not persist properties beyond this limit, and will drop any corresponding values.
If any sources send more than 1,000 events per second in a workspace without prior arrangement, Segment reserves the right to queue any additional events and process those at a rate that doesn’t exceed this limit. To request a higher limit, contactSegment.
Engage rate limit
Engage has a limit of 1,000 events per second for inbound data. Visit theEngage Default Limits documentationto learn more.
Most destinations have their own rate limits that Segment cannot control. In some instances, Segment is able to ingest and attempt to deliver data faster than the downstream destination is able to accept data. Outbound requests to a destination may also fail for other reasons outside of Segment’s control. When requests to downstream destinations fail, Segment makes additional attempts to deliver the data (retries). However, when more than 1,000 requests per second to a downstream destination fail or when the failure rate for a downstream destination exceeds 50% for more than 72 hours, Segment reserves the right to reduce the number of retries until the condition is resolved.

This guide walks you through the set up process for a simple Unify space, which you can use if your Segment implementation is simple. If your implementation is complex, you can use this to demonstrate and test Unify before working on a more complex configuration.
If you’re using Engage, visit theEngage Foundations Onboarding Guidefor additional steps to create audiences, connect to destinations, and more.
To configure and use Unify, you need the following:
When you first start working with Unify, you should start by creating a “Developer” space. This is your experimental and test environment while you learn more about how Unify works. You can validate that identity resolution is working correctly in the Developer space, and then apply those changes to yourProductionspace once you’re sure everything is working as expected.
This two-space method prevents you from making untested configuration changes that immediately affect production data.
You probably have teammates who help set up your Segment Workspace with the data you need. Invite them to your Unify dev space and grant them access to the space. Navigate toAccess Managementin your workspace settings to add them.
If the source you want to add doesn’t appear on the list, then check if the source is enabled. If the source is enabled, verify that you have set up a connection policy which enforces that you can only add sources with specific labels to this space. Read more about Segment’s connection policy in theSpace Setupdocs.
Tip:It sounds a little counter- intuitive to connect a production source to a developer space, but your production sources have rich user data in them, which is what you need to build and validate user profiles.
Once you select sources, Segment starts a replay of one month of historical data from these sources into your Unify space. Segment does this step first so you have some user data to build your first profiles.
The replay usually takes several hours, but the duration will vary depending on how much data you have sent through these sources in the past one month. When the replay finishes, you are notified in the Sources tab under Settings, shown below.
Note: Data replays start with the earliest (oldest) chronological events in the one month window, and finish with the most recent. Don’t continue to the next step until all replays are marked complete. If you do, the data in your Unify data will be stale.
Once the Source(s) finish replaying, data from your connected Sources flows into Unify in near real time, just like it does for sources in your Segment workspace.
Once the replay finishes, you can see the data replayed into Unify using the Profile explorer. You should have a lot! The data should include information from multiple sources and multiple sessions, all resolved into a single profile per user.
Before you continue, check a few user profiles to make sure they show an accurate and recent snapshot of your users.
A good test is to look atyour ownuser profile, and maybe some colleagues’ profiles. Look in the Profile explorer for your Profile, and look at your event history, custom traits and identifiers. If these identifiers look correct across a few different profiles (and you can verify that they are all correct), then you’re ready to create an audience.
If your user profiles look wrong, or you aren’t confident users are being accurately defined and merged, stop here and troubleshoot. It’s important to have accurate identity resolution before you continue. See thedetailed Identity Resolution documentationto better understand how it works, and why you may be running into problems. (Still need help?Contact Segmentfor assistance.)
Once you validate that your data is flowing through Unify, you’re ready to create a Production space. Segment recommends that you repeat the same steps outlined above, focusing on your production use cases and data sources.
If you’re using Engage, view additional steps to complete your space set up in theEngage Foundations Onboarding Guide.
You can rename the Segment space UI name, but can’t modify the space slug. As a result, you can’t change the URL of a space.

Identity Resolution sits at the core of Segment. The Identity Graph merges the complete history of each customer into a single profile, no matter where they interact with your business. Identity Resolution allows you to understand a user’s interaction across web, mobile, server, and third-party partner touch-points in real time, using an online and offline ID graph with support for cookie IDs, device IDs, emails, and custom external IDs. If you are sending theGroup call, you can also understand user behavior at the account-level.

For security reasons, Segment requires that theProfile APIonly be used server-side. The Profile API allows you to look up data about any user given an identifier (for example, email,anonymousId, oruserId) and an authorized access secret. While this enables powerful personalization workflows, it could also let your customers’ data fall into the wrong hands if the access secret were exposed on the client.
Instead, by creating an authenticated personalization endpoint server-side backed by the Profile API, you can serve up personalized data to your users without the risk of their information falling into the wrong hands.

The steps in this guide pertain to spaces created afterOctober 5th, 2020. For spaces created beforeOctober 5th, 2020, please refer toIdentity Resolution Settings.
Workspace owners, administrators, and users with the Identity Admin role can edit Identity Resolution Settings.
Segment creates and merges user profiles based on a space’s Identity Resolution configuration. Segment searches for identifiers such asuserId,anonymousId, andemailon incoming events and matches them to existing profiles or creates new profiles. These identifiers display in the Identities tab of a User Profile in the Profile explorer.
Navigate toUnify > Profile explorerto view identities attached to a profile, along with custom traits, event history, and more.

After receiving a new event, Segment looks for profiles that match any of the identifiers on the event.
Based on the existence of a match, one of three actions can occur:
1: Create a new profileWhen there are no pre-existing profiles that have matching identifiers to the event, Segment creates a new user profile.
2: Add to existing profileWhen there is one profile that matches all identifiers in an event, Segment attempts to map the traits, identifiers, and events on the call to that existing profile. If there is an excess of any identifier on the final profile, Segment defers to the Identity Resolution rules outlined below.
3: Merge existing profilesWhen there are multiple profiles that match the identifiers in an event, Segment checks the Identity Resolution rules outlined below, and attempts to merge profiles.
Identity Admins should first configure Identity Resolution Settings to protect the identity graph from inaccurate merges and user profiles.
During the space creation process, the first step is to choose an Identity Resolution configuration. If this is your first space, you have the option to choose a Segment-suggested Out-of-the-Box configuration or a custom Identity Resolution setup. All other spaces have a third option of importing settings from a different space.

For most first-time users, Segment recommends that you use the out-of-the-box configuration and answer a short series of questions for a best-fit setup for your use-case.
If you have custom unique identifiers or don’t have a canonicaluser_id, you’re automatically redirected to the Identity Resolution Settings page to complete your setup.
If you’re familiar with identity or have custom identifiers, Segment recommends that you select Custom Rules.
Segment redirects you to the Identity Resolution Settings page where you can add Default Identifiers or Custom Identifiers.
Segment’s 11 default are:
You can also provide a trait or property key to match on to add custom identifiers. You can preview the locations where Segment looks for the identifier. Segment accepts both camelCase and snake_case for context.traits, traits, and properties, but accepts lowercase types for identifiers only in the context.externalIds object.

Segment recommends that you proactively prevent using certain values as identifiers. While these values remain in the payload on the event itself, it is not promoted to an identifier Segment uses to determine user profiles.
This is important when developers have a hard-coded value for fields likeuser_idduring QA or development that then erroneously make it to production. This may cause hundreds of profiles to merge incorrectly and can have costly consequences if these spaces already feed data into a production email marketing tool or push notification tool downstream.
In the past, Segment has seen certain default values that cause large amounts of profiles to merge incorrectly. Segment suggests that for every identifier, customers opt into automatically blocking the following suggested values:

Before sending data through, Segment also recommends that you add any default hard-coded values that your team uses during the development process, such asvoidorabc123.
Identity Admins can specify the total number of values allowed per identifier type on a profile during a certain period. For example, in the image below, theanonymous_idfield has a limit of5 Weekly.
This will vary depending on how companies define a user today. In most cases, companies rely onuser_idto distinguish user profiles and Segment defaults to the following configurations:
Specific cases may deviate from this default. For example, a case where a user can have more than oneuser_idbut one email, like whenshopify_idand an internal UUID define a user. In this case, an example configuration may be:
When you choose the limit on an identifier, ask the following questions about each of the identifiers you send to Segment:
Segment considers the priority of an identifier once that identifier exceeds the limit on the final profile.
For example, consider a Segment space with the following Identity Resolution configurations:
A profile already exists withuser_idabc123andemailjane@example1.com. A new event comes in with newuser_idabc456but the sameemailjane@example1.com.
If this event maps to this profile, the resulting profile would then contain twouser_idvalues and oneemail. Given thatuser_idhas a limit of 1, this exceeds the limit of that identifier. As a result, Segment checks the priority of theuser_ididentifier. Becauseemailanduser_idare the two identifiers on the event andemailranks lower thanuser_id, Segment demotesemailas an identifier on the incoming event and tries again.
At this point, the event searches for any profiles that match just the identifier user_idabc456. Now there are no existing profiles with this identifier, so Segment creates a new profile with user_idabc456.
By default, Segment explicitly orders user_id and email as rank1and2, respectively. All other identifiers are in alphabetical order beginning from rank3. This means that if the identifiers sent with events flowing into Segment are user_id, email, anonymous_id, and ga_client_id, the rank would be as follows:
If a new android.id identifier appeared without first giving it explicit order, the order would automatically reshuffle to:
If you require an explicit order for all identifiers, configure this in the Identity Resolution Settings page before sending in events.

When choosing the priority of your identifier, ask the following questions about each of the identifiers you send to Segment:
This option is available to new spaces after you create an initial Dev space. Segment recommends this option when identity settings are validated as correct in the initial Dev space and should be copied into the Production space.
You can review the identifiers, priorities, limits, and blocked values before you complete the import.

After you configure Identity Resolution settings, the next step is to connect asourceto the Segment space.
After you connect a source, Segment creates user profiles based off of replayed and newly incoming data.

The next step, which is important in the Dev space, is to create an audience to ensure that user profiles have populated correctly and that the Identity Resolution settings follow expected business logic.
For example, if there should be 100,000 distinct users who have auser_id, this would be a great way to validate that the Identity Resolution settings have calculated profiles correctly.
For more information about how to create audiences and traits, see Segment’sAudiences docs.

When starting with Unify, begin by creating aDevspace. This will be your sandbox instance of Unify to test new Identity settings, audiences, and traits before applying the same changes to aProdspace that would immediately affect production data flowing to downstream destinations.
Before you connect any source to the Dev space, Segment recommends that you first start by reviewing and configuring your Identity settings, as changes to the Identity rules will only be applied to new events received following any updates. Read more on those settings in theIdentity Resolution Settingsdocs.
If you haven’t already, Segment highly recommends labeling all your sources withDevorProdenvironments. Once your sources have been labeled, visit theConnection Policypage by navigating toUnify > Unify settings > Space management. Here, you can enforce that only sources labeledDevcan be connected to yourDevUnify instance.

Note:The Identity Resolution table can only be edited by workspace owners and users with the Identity Admin role.
Once your connection policy is in place, select theProfile sourcestab inUnify settings. Now you can connect a few sources that will automatically begin to replay.
Once the sources have finished replaying, check user profiles to ensure that profiles are merging as expected. This would also be an ideal time to create test audiences and confirm that these populate the expected number of users.
Connect test audiences or traits to a dev instance of your downstream destination. Confirm that users are appearing as expected.
Once everything looks good to go, create a newProdspace, following all the same steps above, and connect a live instance of your downstream destination to yourProdspace.

Identity Resolution helps create a unified view of the user across devices, apps, and unique identifiers. Identity resolution is critical to understanding the customer journey at multiple touch points, which allows brands to deliver personalized experiences to its customers at scale.
Identity Resolution allows a company to link a customer’s journey from pre-account creation to post-account activity. This is important to help a brand understand the behaviors that lead a user to convert from a window shopper in the discovery stage to a buyer with intent in the consideration and decision stage to the loyal return customer in the conversion and retention stage.
By linking any anonymous events a user had before creating an account to a user’s logged-in activity, a marketing team can now have a complete understanding of a user’s past interactions with your app.
This can lead to invaluable insights into the behaviors and triggers in an app that motivate a user to register for an account.
Users can have multiple touch points with an app ecosystem through more than one device. For example, users might view an eCommerce site through a mobile native app, a mobile web browser, or a desktop web browser.
By tracking a user’s activity across all platforms, brands will be able to more efficiently target campaigns to users as they’ll have the knowledge of funnels that complete across devices.
For example, a user who adds a product to a cart on the iPhone app but completes the checkout on the Android app shouldn’t be targeted with abandoned cart push notifications on the iPhone app.
A company’s product ecosystem may also spread out across multiple apps.
If a company needs to understand a user’s activity across all apps, Segment recommends connecting all sources to the same Space. This provides a comprehensive view of a user’s activity across the entire app ecosystem.
If, however, each app should maintain its own metrics and LTV analysis, regardless of the overlap of users between apps, Segment recommends creating a separate Space per app and only connecting sources related to each app to its space. This will give a siloed view of how users interact with each individual app.
Each workspace has two spaces by default. Contact your CSM to enable additional spaces.
To learn more, visit Segment’seCommerce Example doc.
A user can interact with a brand through multiple channels and departments. A user might have touch points with a sales team, a marketing team, and a customer support team throughout their customer journey. It’s important for companies to have insights into these cross-functional activities to ensure they understand the complete customer experience.
For example, if a user has logged a complaint with a customer support team, the marketing team should exclude this user from an automatic follow-up email asking for them to leave a public product review on their site.

The steps in this guide pertain to spaces created before September 27th, 2020. For spaces created after September 27th, 2020, please refer to theIdentity onboarding guide.
The Identity Graph creates or merges profiles based on externalIDs. ExternalIDs will become the identities attached to a user profile in the Profile explorer.
Navigate toUnify > Profile explorerto view identities attached to a profile, along with custom traits, event history, and more.

Segment automatically promotes the following traits and IDs in track and identify calls to externalIDs:
The Google clientID(ga_clientid) is a unique value created for each browser-device pair and will exist for 2 years if the cookie is not cleared. The analytics.reset() call should be triggered from Segment end when the user logs off. This call will clear the cookies and local Storage created by Segment. It doesn’t clear data from other integrated tools. So on the next login, the user will be assigned with a new unique anonymous_id, but the same ga_clientid will remain if this cookie is not cleared. Hence, the profiles with different anonymous_id but with same ga_clientid will get merged.
Unify resolves identity for any other externalIDs that you bind to users - such as a phone number or any custom identifier that you support.
As long as you’ve configured custom externalIDs, such asphone, in your Space’s Identity Resolution rules, you can include it with thecontext.externalIdsarray, thepropertiesobject, or thecontext.traitsobject.
As seen in the example below, you can send customexternalIdsin thecontextobject of any call to Segment’s API.
The four fields below (id, type, collection, encoding) are all required:
As an example:
Additionally, addingphonewith thepropertiesobject gets picked up by Unify and applied as an externalID:
You can also includephoneusing thecontext.traitsobject and Unify adds it as an externalID to the profile.
Unify creates a user (user_id:use_123)  with the custom externalID (phone:123-456-7890). Query the user’s phone record by using the externalID (phone:123-456-7890), or update the profile with that externalID going forward. (Note: externalIDs must be lower-case.)
Users can view which externalIDs are promoted on each event by viewing the raw payload on Events in the User Profile in the “external_ids” object.
For example, the following user had anonymous_id and user_id promoted as identifiers from the Course Clicked track call:

For example, a new anonymous user visits your Pricing page:
At this point, the Identity Graph will create a new user with external id (anonymous_id:anon_123) and a persistent and globally unique segment_id, in this case:use_4paotyretuj4Ta2bEYQ0vKOq1e7.

Any new events received with the same external id (anonymous_id:anon_123) are appended to same useruse_4paotyretuj4Ta2bEYQ0vKOq1e7.
Next, the user goes to a sign up form and signs up:
At this point, the Identity Graph associates external ID (user_id:use_123) with the same useruse_4paotyretuj4Ta2bEYQ0vKOq1e7.

The steps in this guide pertain to spaces created before September 27th, 2020. For spaces created after September 27th, 2020, please refer to theIdentity Resolution Onboardingdocs.
Before you connect a source to Unify, Segment recommends that you first review the default Identity settings and configure custom rules as needed. Segment applies configuration updates to allnewdata flowing through the space after you save your changes. As a result, if this is your first time setting up your Identity Graph, Segment recommends that you get started with aDevspace in theSpace Setupdocs.
Workspace owners and users with the Identity Admin role can edit the Identity Resolution table.
Changing Identity Resolution rules
Making a space’s Identity Resolution rules less restrictive by changing thelimitshouldn’t cause any issues to existing or future profiles.However, making a space’s rules more restrictive might have an impact existing profiles that don’t adhere to the new rules (for example, decreasing an identifier’s limit or changing thepriorityof identifiers).Segment recommends to get started with a Dev space in theSpace Setupdocs, test the rules with the expected data, and then create an identical Production space with those rules. Document any changes to a space’s Identity Resolution rules, and don’t update rules to be more restrictive after profiles already exist outside the bounds of those new rules.
Segment creates and merges user profiles based on externalIDs used as identifiers. You can view these externalIDs in the Identities tab of a User Profile in the Profile explorer.

By default, Segment promotes the following traits and IDs in track and identify calls to externalIDs:
You’ll notice that these identifiers have theDefaultlabel next to it underIdentifier Type.
To create your own custom externalID, clickAdd Identifier, and add the following:
These custom identifiers must be sent in the customexternalIdsfield in thecontextobject of any call to the Segment API. The four fields below are all required:
The following example payload adds a customphoneexternalID type:
Segment recommends that you add custom externalIDs to the Identity Resolution tablebeforeevents containing this identifier flow through the space. Once an event with a new type of externalID flows into the space, the externalID is automatically added to the table if it wasn’t manually added. When the externalID is automatically added, it defaults to the preset priority and limit, as explained below.
When a new event flows into Unify, Segment looks for profiles that match any of the identifiers on the event.
Based on the existence of a match, one of three actions can occur:
1: Create a new profileWhen there are no pre-existing profiles that have matching identifiers to the event, Segment creates a new user profile.
2: Add to existing profileWhen there is one profile that matches all identifiers in an event, Segment attempts to map the traits, identifiers, and events on the call to that existing profile. If there’s an excess of any identifier on the final profile, Segment defers to the Identity Resolution rules outlined below.
3: Merge existing profilesWhen there are multiple profiles that match the identifiers in an event, Segment checks the Identity Resolution rules outlined below, and attempts to merge profiles.
One common example of a use-case that can cause inaccurate merges is the Shared iPad setup. For example, many companies now have iPads available in-store for customers to register for an account or submit order information. If different users submit information on the same device, there will now be multiple events sent with the same deviceID. Without Identity Resolution rules in place, Segment might see all these different users merged into the same user profile based on this common identifier.
Segment’s three Identity Resolution rules allow Identity Admins to block incorrect values from causing incorrect merges, to set the maximum number of values allowed per externalID, and to customize the priority of these externalIDs.
The following rules exist to increase the likelihood that identities are resolved correctly.
Segment recommends that you proactively block certain values from being used as identifiers. While these values will remain in the payload on the event itself, they are not promoted to the externalID object Segment uses to determine user profiles.
This is important when developers have a hard-coded value for fields like user_id during QA or development that then erroneously makes it production. This can cause hundreds of profiles to merge incorrectly and can have costly consequences when these spaces are already feeding data into a production email marketing tool or push notification tool downstream.
In the past, certain default values cause large amounts of profiles to merge incorrectly. Segment suggests that for every externalID, customers opt into automatically blocking the following suggested values:

Before sending data through, Segment also recommends adding any default hard-coded values that your team uses during the development process, such asvoidorabc123.
Identity Admins can specify the total number of values allowed per identifier type on a profile during a certain period. For example, in the image below, theanonymous_idfield has a limit of5 Weekly.
This will vary depending on how companies define a user today. In most cases, companies rely onuser_idto distinguish user profiles and Segment defaults to the following configurations:
Specific cases may deviate from this default. For example, a case where a user can have more than oneuser_idbut one email, like whenshopify_idand an internal UUID define a user. In this case, an example configuration may be:
When you choose the limit on an identifier, ask the following questions about each of the identifiers you send to Segment:
Segment considers the priority of an identifier once that identifier exceeds the limit on the final profile.
For example, consider a Unify space with the following Identity Resolution configurations:
A profile already exists withuser_idabc123andemailjane@example1.com. A new event comes in with newuser_idabc456but the sameemailjane@example1.com.
If this event maps to this profile, the resulting profile would then contain twouser_idvalues and oneemail. Given thatuser_idhas a limit of 1, this exceeds the limit of that identifier. As a result, Segment checks the priority of theuser_ididentifier. Becauseemailanduser_idare the two identifiers on the event andemailranks lower thanuser_id, Segment demotesemailas an identifier on the incoming event and tries again.
At this point, the event searches for any profiles that match just the identifier user_idabc456. Now there are no existing profiles with this identifier, so Segment creates a new profile with user_idabc456.
By default, Segment explicitly orders user_id and email as rank1and2, respectively. All other identifiers are in alphabetical order beginning from rank3. This means that if the identifiers sent with events flowing into profiles are user_id, email, anonymous_id, and ga_client_id, the rank would be as follows:
If a new android.id identifier appeared without first giving it explicit order, the order would automatically reshuffle to:
If you require an explicit order for all identifiers, configure this in the Identity Resolution settings page before sending in events.

When choosing the priority of your identifier, ask the following questions about each of the identifiers you send to Segment:

Identity Resolution helps to create a unified view of the user across devices, apps, and unique identifiers.
Take the example of a sneaker company called SegmentKicks which has an eCommerce app called SegKicks as well as a running app called SegRuns. This example follows Jane Doe through her customer journey from an anonymous user to a registered buyer on one app, SegKicks, to her use of the same app on a different device, and finally to her use of a different app belonging to the same company, SegRuns.
Identity Resolution can connect a user’s anonymous behaviors to a user’s post-account registration activity.
Take this example using the eCommerce app, SegKicks:
By linking the original anonymous events to Jane’s logged-in activity, the app’s marketing team can now begin to map out her customer journey on a single app, understand her preferences, and re-target her with highly personalized emails about the shoes she didn’t complete purchasing.
Her identifiers will now contain the original anonymous_id, her email, and her user_id:
Users can have multiple touch points with an app ecosystem through more than one device. For example, users might interact with an eCommerce app through both a native app, a mobile browser, and a web browser.
Continuing with the example of Jane Doe, she now views the same mobile app SegKicks on her Android phone.
Jane logs into the Android phone with the same emailjanedoe@example.com.
Her new User Profile identities will now contains anandroid.id:
A company’s product ecosystem may also spread out across multiple apps. For example, SegmentKicks also has a running app SegRuns.
When Jane downloads the Android app SegRuns and views a workout:
Her final identifiers now have a newanonymous_idfrom the SegRuns app:
By combining the events throughout Jane’s entire customer journey from anonymous to known user, cross-device, and cross-app identification, SegKicks and SegRuns can now work together to understand how to give Jane the best customer experience possible while increasing her LTV across the entire SegmentKicks ecosystem.
For example, if Jane looked at ShoeC on her iPhone and completed checkout for ShoeC on her Android, SegKicks will now know to exclude her from a cart abandonment email for ShoeC. This wouldn’t be possible if SegKicks had only looked at her activity on the iPhone.
Additionally, most shoes need to be replaced every 300 to 400 miles. By understanding her activity on SegRuns, SegKicks will now be able to more effectively remind Jane to repurchase ShoeC or ShoeD once she’s reached that mileage.

Profiles Sync connects identity-resolved customer profiles to a data warehouse of your choice.
With a continual flow of synced profiles, teams can enrich and use these data sets as the basis for new audiences and models. Profiles Sync addresses a number of use cases, with applications for identity graph monitoring, attribution analysis, machine learning, and more. ViewProfiles Sync Sample Queriesfor an in-depth guide to Profiles Sync applications.
To help you get started, here are a few example use cases:
Use Profiles Sync for more insight into profiles generated by Segment’sIdentity Resolution. Query the Profile Sync data set to answer questions such as:
Understanding how Segment creates profiles helps you detect potential instrumentation errors.
Join Segment’s profile data with existing object data from your warehouse to create a single view of the customer. You can then use this data set to create personalized  experiences on any channel. For example, B2B companies can build a report that maps sales executives (object data synced with a source like Salesforce) with customers who are most likely to buy a certain product (Profile Traits data synced with Profiles Sync).
With Profiles Sync, your data teams can better understand profile merge events. Connect anonymous IDs, User IDs, and emails to understand your customer’s journey with details such as:
Use Profiles Sync to build data models that marketing partners can trust. Trace prospective customer journeys before buying products, and build models that help you understand which channels provide the most value.
Access profile traits and see how they change over time. This will help you to better understand how your customer’s behavior evolves, and build models that predict LTV, churn, and propensity scores.

On this page, you’ll learn how to set up Profiles Sync, enable historical backfill, and adjust settings for warehouses that you’ve connected to Profiles Sync.
Identity Resolution setup
To use Profiles Sync, you must first set upIdentity Resolution.
To set up Profiles Sync, first create a warehouse, then connect the warehouse within the Segment app.
Before you begin, prepare for setup with these tips:
You’ll first choose the destination warehouse to which Segment will sync profiles. Profiles Sync supports the Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery, Azure, Postgres, and Databricks warehouse Destinations. Your initial setup will depend on the warehouse you choose.
The following table shows the supported Profiles Sync warehouse destinations and the corresponding required steps for each. Select a warehouse, view its Segment documentation, then carry out the warehouse’s required steps before moving to step 2 of Profiles Sync setup:
After you’ve finished the required steps for your chosen warehouse, you’re ready to connect your warehouse to Segment. Because you’ll next enter credentials from the warehouse you just created,leave the warehouse tab open to streamline setup.
To allow Segment to write to the warehouse you’re using for Profiles Sync, you’ll need to set up specific permissions.
For example, if you’re using BigQuery, you mustcreate a service accountfor Segment and assign the following roles:
Review the required steps for each warehouse in the table above to see which permissions you’ll need.
The following Segment accessrolesapply to Profiles Sync:
Unify and Engage read-only: Read-only access to Profiles Sync, including the sync history and configuration settings. With these roles assigned, you can’t download PII or edit Profiles Sync settings.
Unify read-only and Engage user: Read-only access to Profiles Sync, including the sync history and configuration settings. With these roles assigned, you can’t download PII or edit Profiles Sync settings.
Unify and Engage Admin access: Full edit access to Profiles Sync, including the sync history and configuration settings.
After selecting your warehouse, you can connect it to Segment.
During this step, you’ll copy credentials from the warehouse you just set up and enter them into the Segment app. The specific credentials you’ll enter depend on the warehouse you chose during step 1.
Segment may also display IP addresses you’ll need to allowlist in your warehouse. Make sure to copy the IP addresses and enter them into your warehouse account.
To connect your warehouse:
Set up Selective Sync to control the exact tables and columns that Segment will sync to your connected data warehouse.
Data will be backfilled to your warehouse based on the last two months of history.
You can sync the following tables:
Use Selective Sync to manage the data you send to your warehouses by choosing which tables and columns (also known as properties) to sync. Syncing fewer tables and properties will lead to faster and more frequent syncs, faster queries, and using less disk space.
You can access Selective Sync in two ways:
You’ll see a list of event type tables, event tables, andtables Segment materializesavailable to sync. Select the tables and properties that you’d like to sync, and be sure the ones you’d like to prevent from syncing aren’t selected.
Regardless of schema size, only the first 5,000 collections and 5,000 properties per collection can be managed using your Segment space. To edit Selective Sync settings for any collection which exceeds this limit,contact Segment support.
You must be a workspace owner to change Selective Sync settings.
Use Selective Sync when you want to prevent specific tables and properties from syncing to your warehouse. Segment stops syncing from disabled tables or properties, but will not delete any historical data from your warehouse.
If you choose to re-enable a table or property to sync again, only new data generated will sync to your warehouse. Segment doesn’t backfill data that was omitted with Selective Sync.
Profiles Sync sends profiles to your warehouse hourly once setup completes. Setup is complete after an initial automated backfill syncs all profile data. To initiate the backfill, the Profiles Sync requires live data flowing into your workspace. If live data isn’t available, you can send test data to trigger the backfill sooner. Backfill can also sync historical profiles to your warehouse.
You can only use historical backfill for tables that you enable withSelective Syncduring setup. Segment does not backfill tables that you disable with Selective Sync.
When Segment runs historical backfills:
Segment lands the data on an internal staging location, then removes the backfill banner. Segment then syncs the backfill data to your warehouse.
Reach out toSegment supportif your use case exceeds the scope of the initial setup backfill.
While historical backfill is running, you can start buildingmaterialized viewsand runningsample queries.
During setup, you have the option of setting up materialized key views in one of two ways:
You can choose to materialize views on your own by usingprofiles raw tables. 
You may want to materialize your own tables if, for example, you want to transform additional data or join Segment profile data with external data before materialization.
You can choose to use Segment’s open source dbt models by usingprofiles materializedtables.
You can alternatively usetables that Segment materializesand syncs to your data warehouse.
To start seeing unified profiles in your warehouse and build attribution models, you’ll need to materialize the tables that Profiles Sync lands into three key views:
SeeTables you materializefor more on how to materialize these views either on your own, or withSegment’s open source dbt models.
Note that dbt models are in beta and need modifications to run efficiently on BigQuery, Synapse, and Postgres warehouses. Segment is actively working on this feature.
As you use Profiles Sync, keep the following limits in mind:
You can view warehouse sync information in the overview section of the Profiles Sync page. Segment displays the dates and times of the last and next syncs, as well as your sync frequency.
In the Syncs table, you’ll find reports on individual syncs. Segment lists your most recent syncs first. The following table shows the information Segment tracks for each sync:
Selecting a row from the Syncs table opens a pane that contains granular sync information. In this view, you’ll see the sync’s status, duration, and start time. Segment also displays a nuanced breakdown of the total rows synced, sorting them into identity graph tables, event type tables, and event tables.
If the sync failed, Segment shows any available error messages in the sync report.
TheSettingstab of the Profiles Sync page contains tools that can help you monitor and maintain your synced warehouse.
In theBasic settingstab, you can disable warehouse syncs or delete your connected warehouse altogether.
To disable syncs, toggleSync statusto off. Segment retains your warehouse credentials but stops further syncs. Toggle Sync status back on at any point to continue syncs.
To delete your warehouse, toggleSync statusto off, then selectDelete warehouse. Segment doesn’t retain credentials for deleted warehouses; to reconnect a deleted warehouse, you must set it up as a new warehouse.
In theConnection settingstab, you can verify your synced warehouse’s credentials and view IP addresses you’ll need to allowlist so that Segment can successfully sync profiles.
If you have write access, you can verify that your warehouse is successfully connected to Segment by entering your password and then selectingTest Connection.
Changing your synced warehouse
If you’d like to change the warehouse connected to Profiles Sync,reach out to Segment support.
Segment supports hourly syncs.

With Databricks for Profiles Sync, you can useProfiles Syncto sync Segment profiles into your Databricks Lakehouse.
Before getting started with Databricks Profiles Sync, note the following prerequisites for setup.
A SQL warehouse is required for compute. Segment recommends a warehouse with the the following characteristics:
To improve the query performance of the Delta Lake, Segment recommends creating compact jobs per table using OPTIMIZE followingDatabricks recommendations.
Segment recommends manually starting your SQL warehouse before setting up your Databricks destination. If the SQL warehouse isn’t running, Segment attempts to start the SQL warehouse to validate the connection and may experience a timeout when you hit theTest Connectionbutton during setup.
Use the five steps below to connect to your Databricks warehouse.
To configure your warehouse, you’ll need read and write permissions.
Pick a name to help you identify this space in the warehouse, or use the default name provided. You can’t change this name once the warehouse is connected.
You’ll use the Databricks workspace URL, along with Segment, to access your workspace API.
Check your browser’s address bar when inside the workspace. The workspace URL should resemble:https://<workspace-deployment-name>.cloud.databricks.com. Remove any characters after this portion and note the URL for later use.
This catalog is the target catalog where Segment lands your schemas and tables.
Next, add SQL warehouse details about your compute resource.
Segment uses the service principal to access your Databricks workspace and associated APIs.
Service principal client ID: Follow theDatabricks guide for adding a service principal to your account. This name can be anything, but Segment recommends something that identifies the purpose (for example, “Segment Profiles Sync”).  Segment doesn’t requireAccount adminorMarketplace adminroles.
The service principal needs the following setup:
Client secret: Follow theDatabricks instructions to generate an OAuth secret.
Once you’ve configured your warehouse, test the connection and clickNext.
With selective sync, you can choose exactly which tables you want synced to the Databricks warehouse. Segment syncs materialized view tables as well by default.
Select tables to sync, then clickNext. Segment creates the warehouse and connects databricks to your Profiles Sync space.
You can view sync status, and the tables you’re syncing from the Profiles Sync overview page.

Paragraphs:
Unify requires a Business tier account and is included with Engage.See theavailable plans, orcontact Support.
On this page
On this page, you’ll find queries that you can run with Profiles Sync to address common use cases.
The examples in this guide are based on a Snowflake installation. If you’re using another warehouse, you may need to adjust the syntax.
The queries on this page use two example schemas:
These schema names may not match your own.
These queries let you view and manage identity graphs, which give you insight into unified customer profiles generated byidentity resolution.
This example queries theid_graph_udpatestable to measure the rate at which Segment creates and merges profiles, as well as the type of event that triggered the profile change:
Segment’sconfigurable identifier limitslet you set maximum values for identifiers like email. These maximum configured values help prevent two separate users from being merged into a single Profile.
The following query lets you view Profiles that have reached a configured limit for the email identifier:
When a merge occurs, Segment selects and associates a single trait value with a profile. This logic depends on how you materialize theprofile_traitstable.
You can break out a profile, though, to see the trait versions that existed before the merge. As a result, you can identify a particular trait’s origin.
The following example inspects a particular profile,use_XX, and trait,trait_1. The query reports the profile’s last observed trait, its source ID, and any profiles Segment has since merged into the profile:
The following three snippets will provide a full list of your customers, along with:
Provides the latest subscription status set for all identifiers in the space. This query will not include identifiers that have no subscription status ever set.
To get complete user histories, join event tables to the identity graph and aggregate or filter withid_graph.canonical_segment_id:
Suppose you want to track a user’s entrances and exits of the audienceaud_1. Running the following query would return all qualifying entrance and exits:
This query works with any Trait or Audience membership, whether computed in Engage or instrumented upstream.
Yes. Engage sends updates to Audience membership (as a boolean) and computed trait value updates as traits on an Identify call that Segment forwards to your data warehouse.
The column name corresponds to the Audience or Trait key shown on the settings page:
Surface these values the same way as any other trait value:
Identity merges change Segment’s understanding of who performed historical events.
For example, ifprofile_bcompleted a “Product Purchased” event but Segment understands thatprofile_bshould be merged intoprofile_a, Segment deduces thatprofile_aperformed that initial “Product Purchased” event.
With that in mind, here’s how to differentiate betweensegment_idandcanonical_segment_id:
The mapping between these two identifiers materializes in yourid_graphtable. If a profile has not been merged away, thensegment_idis equivalent tocanonical_segment_id. If a profile has been merged away,id_graphreflects that state.
As a result, you can retrieve a customer’s complete event history by joining an event table, likeproduct_purchasedtoid_graph.
For more information, view theProfiles Sync tables guide.
Profiles Sync mimics the materialization performed bySegment Unify. A user’s merges, external IDs, and traits should be expected whether they’re queried in the warehouse, Profile API, or viewed in the UI.
The following edge cases might drive slight (<0.01%) variation:
By contrast, Segment Unify and incrementally-built Profiles Sync materializations won’t combine already-computed traits across two merged profiles at the moment of merge. Instead, one profile’s traits will be chosen across the board.
Theexternal_id_hashis a hash of theexternal_id_typeandexternal_id_valueusing SHA-1. This field corresponds to theprimary_keyfor the table:hash (external_id_type and external_id_value).
For example, in BigQuery the logic is:TO_HEX(SHA1(concat(external_id_type, external_id_value))) as seg_hash.

Through Profiles Sync, Segment provides data sets and models that can help you enrich customer profiles using any warehouse data available to you.
Using a practical example of how Segment connects and then merges anonymous profiles, this page explains the tables that Segment lands, as well as the tables you materialize as part of Profiles Sync.
To help illustrate the possible entries and values populated into Profiles Sync tables, view the event tabs below and consider the following scenario.
Suppose the following four events lead to the creation of two separate profiles:
Initially, Segment generates two profiles for the first three calls. In the final event, though, Segment understands that Profile 2 should be merged into Profile 1.  Segment then merges Profile 2 into Profile 1, merging away Profile 2 in the process.
Profiles Sync tracks and provides information about these events through a set of tables, which you’ll learn about in the next section.
Profile raw tables contain records of changes to your Segment profiles and Identity Graph over time.
With raw tables, you have full control over the materialization of Profiles in your warehouse, as well as increased observibility.
Raw tables contain complete historical data when using historical backfill.
Theid_graph_updatestable maps between the following:
As a result, this table contains information about the creation and merging of profiles, as well as the specific events that triggered those changes.
Using the events from the profile merge case study, Segment would generate three new entries to this table:
In this example, the table showsprofile_2mapping to two places: first to itself, then, later, toprofile_1after the merge occurs.
Segment shows the complete history of every profile. If, later,profile_1merges into a differentprofile_0, Segment adds recursive entries to show thatprofile_1andprofile_2both map toprofile_0.  These entries give you a comprehensive history of all profiles that ever existed.
If you’ll use Profiles Sync to build models, refer to theid_graphmodel, which can help you put together a complete view of a customer.
This table maps Segment-generated identifiers, likesegment_id, to external identifiers that your users provide. It has the following columns:
The anonymous site visits sample used earlier would generate the following events:
In this table, Segment shows three observed identifiers. For each of the three identifiers, Segment outputs the Segment ID initially associated with the identifier.
Theprofile_traits_updatestable maps eachsegment_idwith all associated profile traits.
Segment updates this table:
In the event that two profiles merge, Segment only updates theprofile_traits_updatestable for thecanonical_segment_id, or the fully merged id.
From theprofile_traits_updatestable, use Segment’sopen-source dbt models, or your own tools to materialize theprofile_traitstable with all profiles and associated profile traits in your data warehouse.
Event type tables provide a complete history for each type of event. Segment syncs events based on the event sources you’ve connected to Unify.
Identity Resolution processes these events, and includes asegment_id, enabling the data to be joined into a single Profile record.
Event type tables will have 2 months of historical data on backfill.
Event type tables includes the following tables:
These event tables are similar to the tables landed by Segment warehouse integrations, with the following exceptions:
The previous result would generate two entries in thepagestable:
And two entries in theidentifiestable:
All these events were performed by the same person. If you use these tables to assemble your data models, though, always join them againstid_graphto resolve each event’scanonical_segment_id.
You might see columns appended withhidden_entryorhidden_entry_joined_atin profile data of users in Journeys. Segment uses these for internal purposes, and they do not require any attention or action.
Profiles Sync uses the following schema:<profiles_space_name>.<tableName>.
Note that the Profiles Sync schema is different from the Connections Warehouse schema:<source_name>.<tableName>.
If your space has the same name as a source connected to your Segment Warehouse destination, Segment overwrites data to the Event tables.
For more on Profiles Sync logic, table mappings, and data types, download thisProfiles Sync ERDor visitschema evolution and compatibility.
Track event tables provide a complete event history, with one table for each unique named Track event. Segment syncs events based on the event sources you’ve connected to Unify.
These tables include a full set of Track event properties, with one column for each property.
Segment’s Identity Resolution has processed these events, which contain asegment_id, enabling the data to be joined into a single profile record.
These tables will have two months of historical data on backfill.
To view and select individual track tables, edit your sync settings after you enable Profiles Sync, and wait for the initial sync to complete.
With Profiles Sync, you can access the following three tables that Segment materializes for a more complete view of your profile:
These materialized tables provide a snapshot of your Segment profiles, batch updated according to your sync schedule.
If you’re not using materialized views for Profile Sync and would like to switch, follow these steps:
For materialized view tables, you must have delete permissions for your data warehouse.
Materialized views offer several advantages:
With theuser_traitstable, you’ll see all traits that belong to a profile, represented by thecanonical_segment_id. Use this table for a complete picture of your Profiles Sync data with external data sources such as customer purchase history, product usage, and more.
When a merge occurs, two things happen:
This table has the following columns:
Theuser_identifierstable contains all external ID values that map to a profile, which is represented by thecanonical_segment_id.
With theuser_identifierstable:
When a merge occurs:
This table has the following columns:
Theprofile_mergestable contains all mappings from asegment_idto a profile, represented by thecanonical_segment_id. This mapping indicates that a profile has been created within Segment.
With theprofile_mergestable:
When a merge occurs:
This table has the following columns:
You can materialize the following tables with your own tools, or using Segment’sopen-source dbt models:
You might want to materialize your own tables if, for example, you want to transform additional data or join Segment profile data with external data before materialization.
You can alternatively use tables that Segment materializes and syncs to your data warehouse.Learn moreabout the tables Segment materializes.
Please note that dbt models are in beta and need modifications to run efficiently on BigQuery, Synapse, and Postgres warehouses. Segment is actively working on this feature.
Every customer profile (orcanonical_segment_id) will be represented in each of the following tables.
This table represents the current state of your identity graph, showing only where asegment_idis now understood to point.
The most recent entry for eachsegment_idfromid_graph_updatesreflects this. After the four example events,id_graphwould show the following:
Segment drops most diagnostic information from this table, since it’s designed for reference use. In this case, you’d learn that any data references toprofile_2orprofile_1now map to the same customer,profile_1.
Use this table to view the full, current-state mapping between each external identifier you’ve observed and its corresponding, fully-mergedcanonical_segment_id.
In the case study example, you’d see the following:
Use theprofile_traitstable for a singular view of your customer. With this table, you can view all custom traits, computed traits, SQL traits, audiences, and journeys associated with a profile in a single row.
Theprofile_traitstable contains the last seen value for any of your customer profile traits that Segment processes as an Identify call.
If Segment later merges away a profile, it populates thesegment_idit merged in themerged_tocolumn.
In the case study example, Segment only collected email.  As a result, Segment would generate the followingprofile_traitstable:
Merged profiles
Profiles that Segment merges away are no longer canonical.

The Data Graph acts as a semantic layer that allows businesses to define relationships between various entity datasets in the warehouse — such as accounts, subscriptions, households, and products — with the Segment Profile. It makes these relational datasets easily accessible to business teams for targeted and personalized customer engagements.
To use the Data Graph, you’ll need the following:
Data Graph, Reverse ETL, and Profiles Sync require different warehouse permissions.
Data Graph currently only supports workspaces in the United States.
To get started with the Data Graph, set up the required permissions in your warehouse. Segment supports the following:
To track the data sent to Segment on previous syncs, Segment usesReverse ETLinfrastructure to store diffs in tables within a dedicated schema called_segment_reverse_etlin your data warehouse. You can choose which database or project in your warehouse this data lives in.
To connect your warehouse to the Data Graph:
The Data Graph is a semantic layer that represents a subset of relevant business data that marketers and business stakeholders can use for audience targeting and personalization in downstream tools. Use the configuration language spec and the following features to build your Data Graph:
Defining Relationships
Similar to the concept ofcardinality in data modeling, the Data Graph supports 3 types of relationships:
Data Graph Example

The first step in creating a Data Graph is to define your entities. An entity corresponds to a table in the warehouse.
Example:
Segments recommends that you select materialized views under the ProfilesSelective Sync settingsto optimize warehouse compute costs.
Next, define the profile. This is a special class of entity that represents Segment Profiles, which corresponds to the Profiles Sync tables and models. For Linked Audiences, this allows marketers to filter on profile traits, event history, etc. There can only be one profile for a Data Graph.
Example:
Now define your relationships between your entities. Similar to the concept ofcardinality in data modeling, the Data Graph supports 3 types of relationships below. All relationship types require you to define the relationship slug, name, and related entity. Each type of relationship has unique join on conditions.
This is the first level of relationships and a unique type of relationship between the Segment profile entity and a related entity.
To define a profile-to-entity relationship, reference your entity table and depending on your table columns, choose to join on one of the following:
Option 1 (Most common) - Join on an external ID:Use theexternal_idblock to join the profile entity with an entity table using external IDs from yourUnify ID resolutionsettings. Typically these identifiers areuser_id,email, orphonedepending on the column in the entity table that you want to join with.
Option 2 - Join on a profile trait:Use thetraitsblock to join the profile entity with an entity table usingProfile Traits.
Example:
For 1:many relationships, define the join on between the two entity tables using the spec below.
Example:
For many:many relationships, define the join on between the two entity tables with thejunction_table.
Attributes from a junction table are not referenceable via the Linked Audience builder. If a marketer would like to filter upon a column on the junction table, you must define the junction as an entity and define a relationship.
Junction table spec
Example:
You can validate your Data Graph using the preview, then click Save. After you’ve set up your Data Graph, your partner teams can start leveraging these datasets with withLinked EventsandLinked Audiences.
To edit your Data Graph:
A data consumer refers to a Segment feature like Linked Events and Linked Audiences that are referencing datasets, such as entities and/or relationships, from the Data Graph. You can view a list of data consumers in two places:
Upon editing and saving changes to your Data Graph, a modal will pop up to warn of breaking and/or potential breaking changes to your data consumers. You must acknowledge and clickConfirm and savein order to proceed.
Segment has a service that regularly scans and monitors the Data Graph for changes that occur in your warehouse that may break components of the Data Graph, like when the table being referenced by the Data Graph gets deleted from your warehouse or when the primary key column no longer exists. An alert banner will be displayed on the Data Graph landing page. The banner will be removed once the issues are resolved in your warehouse and/or the Data Graph. You will also have the option to trigger a manual sync of your warehouse schema.
Configure alerts for breaking changes to receive notifications over Slack, email, or in-app notification whenever Segment detects a breaking change in your warehouse.
To configure alerts for breaking changes:

Set up your BigQuery data warehouse to Segment for theData Graph.
You need to be an account admin to set up the Segment BigQuery connector as well as write permissions for the__segment_reverse_etldataset.
To set the roles and permissions:
Create a new dataset as Segment requires write access to the dataset for internal bookkeeping and to store checkpoint tables for the queries that are executed.
Segment recommends you to create a new dataset for the Data Graph. If you choose to use an existing dataset that has also been used forSegment Reverse ETL, you must follow theadditional instructionsto update user access for the Segment Reverse ETL catalog.
To create your dataset, navigate to the BigQuery SQL editor and create a dataset that will be used by Segment.
Grant theBigQuery Data Viewerrole to the service account at the project level. Make sure to grant read-only access to the Profiles Sync project in case you have a separate project.
To grant read-only access for the Data Graph:
If you want to restrict access to specific datasets, grant the BigQuery Data Viewer role on datasets to the service account. Make sure to grant read-only access to the Profiles Sync dataset.
To restrict read-only access:
You can also run the following command:
If you ran Segment Reverse ETL in the project you are configuring as the Segment connection project, a Segment-managed dataset is already created and you need to provide the new Segment user access to the existing dataset.
If you run into an error on the Segment app indicating that the user doesn’t have sufficient privileges on an existing__segment_reverse_etldataset, grant theBigQuery Data Editorrole on the__segment_reverse_etldataset to the service account . Note that the__segment_reverse_etldataset is hidden in the console. Run the following SQL command:

Use Linked Events to enrich real-time event streams with entities from your data warehouse to your destinations. Insert additional event context for downstream applications for richer data about each event.
Consent enforcement for Linked Events
You can useConsent Managementto enforce consent in your downstream destinations for Linked Events stamped with theconsent object. You must enable Consent Management and have consent stamped on events from event streaming sources to use Consent Management. You cannot use Linked Events to enrich events with consent preferences that are stored in your warehouse.
On this page, you’ll learn how to get started with Linked Events.
Linked Events warehouse support
Linked Events supports Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, and Databricks.
With Linked Events, you can:
To use Linked Events, you’ll need the following:
Segment stores and processes all data in the United States.
Profiles Sync isn’t required for Linked Events.
The following Segment accessrolesapply to Linked Events:
Entities Admin Access: Entities Admins have the ability to view and edit entity models and connection details.
Entities Read-only Access: Entities Read-only users have the ability to view entity models.
To create models and enrich events in destinations, you need to be aWorkspace Owneror have the following roles:
Linked Events uses Segment’sReverse ETLinfrastructure for pulling in data from your warehouse.
To get started, you’ll need to set up your data warehouse and provide the correct access detailed in the set up steps below. Linked Events supportsBigQuery,Databricks,Snowflake, andRedshift.
Before getting started with the Data Graph, be sure to set up your warehouse permissions.
Linked Events uses Reverse ETL to compute the incremental changes to your data directly within your data warehouse. The Unique Identifier column detects data changes, such as new, updated, and deleted records.
For Segment to compute data changes in your warehouse, Segment requires both read and write permissions to the warehouse schema table. At a high level, the extract process requires read permissions for the query being executed. Segment tracks changes to the query results through tables that Segment manages in a dedicated schema (for example,_segment_reverse_etl), which requires some write permissions.
Only sync what you need for enrichment. There may be cost implications to having Segment query your warehouse tables.
Linked Events syncs data from your warehouse approximately once every hour.
The table below shows the data warehouses Linked Events supports. View the Segment docs for your warehouse, then carry out the corresponding steps.
The Data Graph is a semantic layer that represents a subset of relevant business data that you’ll use to enrich events in downstream tools. Use the configuration language spec below to add models to build out your Data Graph.
Each Unify space has one Data Graph. The current version is v0.0.6 but this may change in the future as Segment accepts feedback about the process.
Deleting entities and relationships are not yet supported.
Snowflake schemas are case sensitive, so you’ll need to reflect the schema, table, and column names based on how you case them in Snowflake.
An entity is a stateful representation of a business object. The entity corresponds to a table in the warehouse that represents that entity.
To use Linked Events, you’ll need to add an action destination to send enriched events to. Navigate toConnections > Destinations. Select an existing action destination, or click+ Add destinationto add a new action destination.
For Linked Events, Segment supportsDestination Actionsin cloud-mode only.
With Linked Events, you can select entities and properties from your data warehouse, then add enrichments to map properties to your connected destination.
To enrich events with entities:
After you load a sample event, you can add entities from theEnrich events with entitiessection. You’ll select an entity, then an entity match property.
After you’ve added an entity and match property, add your event enrichments.
Use enrichments to select the entity you wish to send to your downstream destination.
In the Mappings tab, locate theSelect Mappingssection where you can enrich source properties from the entities you’ve selected in the previous step.
At this time, Linked Events doesn’t support a preview of enriched payloads.
When you’re satisfied with the mappings, clickSave. Segment returns you to the Mappings table.
At this time, when you select mappings or test events, you won’t see enrichment data. Enrichment data is only available with real events.
To verify which of your events matched one or more enrichments:
To use Linked Events, be sure that you have proper permissions for the Data Warehouse you’re using. Visit theBigQuery,Databricks,Snowflake, andRedshiftsetup guides to learn more about updating permissions.
Segment currently syncs once every hour.
For Linked Events, Segment supports all actions-based destinations in cloud-mode. Device-mode destinations are not supported.
Test events don’t send Linked Events. You’ll only see test events that come from the source debugger, which is ahead of the event enrichment.
Linked Events uses the existing Audit Trail in your Segment workspace. To view your Audit Trail, navigate toSettings > Admin > Audit Trail.
You can define a schedule for refreshing the linked data from your data warehouse.
To use entities with Linked Events, you’ll need to set theenrichment_enabledflag totrue. Here’s the sample code:

To provide consistent performance and reliability at scale, Segment enforces default use limits for Linked Events.
Linked Events provides you with the flexibility to enrich unlimited events in downstream destinations. This means you won’t encounter any limitations or pauses in service related to the number of Linked Events enrichments.
Segment measures Linked Events limits based on entities and entity rows.
To see how many entities and entity rows you’re using with Linked Events, navigate toSettings > Usage & billingand select theLinked Eventstab.
There is a hard limit of 100 million entity rows that causes syncs to pause.

Predictions, Segment’s artificial intelligence and machine learning feature, lets you predict the likelihood that users will perform any event tracked in Segment.
With Predictions, you can identify users with, for example, a high propensity to purchase, refer a friend, or use a promo code. Predictions also lets you predict a user’s lifetime value (LTV).
Segment saves predictions to user profiles, letting you build Audiences, trigger Journeys, and send data to downstream destinations.
For more details on AI usage and data, seePredictions Nutrition Facts Label.
On this page, you’ll learn how to build a prediction.

Follow these steps to build a prediction:
Keep the following in mind when you build a prediction:
In the next section, you’ll learn more about the four available predictions.
Segment offers four predictions: Custom Predictive Goals, Likelihood to Purchase, Predicted LTV, and Likelihood to Churn.
Custom Predictive Goals require a starting cohort, target event, and quality data.
When you build a Custom Predictive Goal, you’ll first need to select a cohort, or a group of users, for which you want to make a prediction. Traits with small cohorts compute faster and tend to be more accurate. If you want to predict for an entire audience, though, skip cohort selection and move to selecting a target event.
The target event is the Segment event that you want to predict. In creating a prediction, Segment determines the likelihood of the user performing the target event. Segment lets you include up to two target events and an event property in your prediction.
In machine learning, better data leads to better predictions. Because Segment prioritizes trust and performance, Segment has a number of data checks to ensure that each prediction is reliable and of high quality. Segment provides guidance in the UI before you create a trait, but some checks only occur during model training. If a trait fails, you’ll see an error message and description in the UI.
This sections lists Segment’s access and data requirements, service limits, and best practices for Predictions.
For example, to predict a customer’s propensity to purchase over the next 30 days, set the Target Window to 30 days and the Target Event toOrder Completed(or the relevant purchase event that you track).
To access Predictions, you must:
This table lists the requirements for a trait to compute successfully:
Some customers want to specifically include or exclude events that get fed into the model. For example, if you track different events from an EU storefront compared to a US storefront and you only want to make predictions using data from the US, you could unselect the events from the EU space. This step is optional, Segment only recommends using it if you have a clear reason in mind for removing events from becoming a factor in the model.
Predictive Traits and anonymous events
Predictive Traits are limited to non-anonymous events, which means you’ll need to include an additionalexternal_idother thananonymousIdin the targeted events. If want to create Predictive Traits based on anonymous events, reach out to your CSM with your use case for creating an anonymous Predictive Trait and the conditions for trait.
Likelihood to Purchase is identical to Custom Predictive Goals, but Segment prefills theOrder Completedevent, assuming it’s tracked in your Segment instance.
If you don’t trackOrder Completed, choose a target event that represents a customer making a purchase.
Predicted Lifetime Value predicts a customer’s future spend over the next 120 days. To create this prediction, select a purchase event, revenue property, and the currency (which defaults to USD). LTV is only calculated for customers that have performed the selected purchase events 2 or more times. The following table contains details for each property:
Likelihood to Churn proactively identifies customers likely to stop using your product. Segment builds this prediction by determining whether or not a customer will perform a certain action.
To use Likelihood to Churn, you’ll need to specify a customer event, a future time frame for which you want the prediction to occur, and if you want to know whether the customer will or won’t perform the event.
For example, suppose you wanted to predict whether or not a customer would view a page on your site over the next three months. You would selectnot perform,Page Viewed, andat least 1 time within 90 days.
Churn predictions are only made for eligible customers. In the previous example, only customers that have performedPage Viewedin the last 90 days would be eligible to recieve this prediction. The Segment app shows you which customers are eligibile to recieve this prediction.
Segment then uses this criteria to build the prediction and create specific percentile cohorts. You can then use these cohorts to target customers with retention flows, promo codes, or one-off email and SMS campaigns.
For use cases and information on how Segment builds prediction, readUsing Predictions.

Predictions are stored ascomputed traitsin user profiles, with scores represented as percentage cohorts. For example, a score of0.8indicates the user is in the 80th percentile, or the top 20% of the cohort.
After selecting a cohort, use Predictions with the following Segment features:
You can access generated Predictions in thePredictiontab of your Trait. The Prediction tab gives you actionable insight into your prediction.

TheExplore your predictionsection of the Prediction tab visualizes prediction data and lets you create Audiences to target. An interactive chart displays a percentile cohort score that indicates the likelihood of users in each group to convert on your chosen goal. You can choose the top 20%, bottom 80%, or create custom ranges for specific use cases.
You can then create an Audience from the group you’ve selected, letting you send efficient, targeted marketing campaigns within Journeys. You can also send your prediction data to downstream destinations.
Predictions rank your customers by their likelihood to perform a specific conversion event, from most to least likely.
For each custom prediction, Segment monitors the percentile cohort where customers were ranked when they performed the predicted conversion event. After around 7 days, Segment creates a graph data visualization, allowing you to evaluate the prediction’s accuracy based on real workspace data.

For example, suppose you’re predicting the likelihood of customers completing anorder_completedevent. The graph shows that:
This pattern shows that the prediction was extremely accurate in identifying customers most likely to convert. Ideally, most graphs will show a similar trend, where the highest-ranked cohorts have the most conversion activity.
However, this pattern can change depending on how you use Predictions. For example, if you run a marketing campaign targeting the bottom 10% cohort, you might see an increase in conversions for that group instead.
Like any AI or machine learning tool, Predictions may not always be perfect. Start small, test your predictions, and refine your approach as needed. Model monitoring makes it easier to measure and improve the accuracy of your predictions.
The Predictions tab’sUnderstand your predictionsection provides insights into the performance of the underlying predictive model. This information helps you understand the data points that contribute to the prediction results.

The Understand your prediction dashboard displays the following model metrics:
Predictions offer more value in some situations than others. This sections covers common scenarios where predictions have high impact, as well as others where alternative approaches may be more appropriate.
Predictions are most effective in the following situations:
Predictions may not be as beneficial in the following situations:
Segment uses a binary classification model that uses decision trees.
Once Segment creates your prediction, you can check the model statistics page, where Segments shows you how the model was created. Segment also maintains automated systems that monitor model performance and will alert you if your model is not predictive.
Trait creation depends on the amount of data, but Segment expects predictions to be completed in around 24 hours. For larger customers, however, this could take 48 hours. Predictions shows a status ofIn Progresswhile computing; Segment updates this status when customers are scored.
These data science statistics measure the effectiveness of Segment’s predictions when tested against historical data. For more information, refer toROC Curve and AUC,The Lift Curve in Machine Learning, andIntuition behind log-loss score.
The Prediction Quality Score factors AUC, log loss, and lift quality to determine whether Segment recommends using the prediction. A model can have a score of Poor, Fair, Good, or Excellent.
The created trait value represents the user’s percentile cohort. This value will refresh when we re score the customers based on your refresh cadence. If you see0.85on a user’s profile, this means the user is in the 85th percentile, or the top 15% for the prediction.
Segment rebuilds the machine learning model every 30 days.
By default, Segment refreshes scores every 7 days. However, you can request that trait values update daily. Reach out to your CSM to determine your eligibility.
Predictive Traits can’t be updated, but Predictive Audiences can. To modify a Predictive Trait, you’ll need to recreate it.
You get five predictions as part of Engage Foundations or Unify Plus. To purchase more predictions, reach out to your CSM.
Predictive Audiences contribute to the Engage limit of 100 audiences. Whether you create the audience manually or with predictive modeling, the audience counts towards the 100-audience limit.
Yes.
Yes. Keep the following in mind when you work with Predictions:
The probabilities for all users are added together and then divided by the total number of users. If a user’s score in “Likelier to convert than average” is below 1, it means they are less likely than the average user to convert.

Suggested Predictive Audiences can help you improve customer engagement, drive higher conversion rates, and reduce ad spend.
This page explains what a Suggested Predictive Audience is, how to build a Suggested Predictive Audience, and what each available Audience targets.
A Suggested Predictive Audience is an out-of-the-box Audience template driven by machine learning.
Segment offersfive templatesthat are prebuilt withPredictionslike likelihood to purchase and lifetime predicted value. Selecting a template generates a Predictive Audience whose members you can engage in a number of ways:

Your Suggested Predictive Audience is now live.
Engage offers five Suggested Predictive Audiences. The following table summarizes the customers each Audience targets and the events and traits Engage uses to build the Audience:
Choose aReady to buyPredictive Audience to target customers who show a high propensity to make a purchase.
Segment builds this Audience with theLikelihood to Purchase prediction. Audience members show encouraging engagement and have a likelihood to buy in the top 20th percentile.
Choose aLong shotPredictive Audience to target customers who have made a purchase but have a middling likelihood to buy.
Segment builds this Audience with theOrder Completedevent andLikelihood to Purchasetrait. Audience members have completed a purchase but currently have a likelihood to buy somewhere between the 25th and 65th percentile.
Choose aHigh lifetime valuePredictive Audience to target customers that show a high predicted lifetime value.
Segment builds this Audience with thePredicted LTV prediction. Audience members are in the top 10th percentile of predicted lifetime value and Segment expects that they’ll spend the most over the next 90 days.
Choose aPotential VIPsPredictive Audience to target customers exhibiting several promising marketing behaviors.
Segment builds this Audience with thePage Viewedevent and Likelihood to Purchase and Predicted LTV prediction. Audience members have been active on your site within the last two weeks, have a high predicted lifetime value, and a high propensity to purchase.
Choose aDormantPredictive Audience to target inactive customers.
Segment builds this Audience with thePage Viewedevent and the Likelihood to Purchase Predictive Trait. Audience members have a low likelihood to purchase and haven’t been active on your site in the last 60 days.

Beginning August 18, 2023, new Unify Plus users can access Computed Traits in Unify.
Computed Traits allow you to quickly create user or account-level calculations that Segment keeps up-to-date over time. These can be computations like thetotal_num_ordersa customer has completed, thelifetime_revenueof a customer, themost_frequent_userto determine which user is most active in an account, or theunique_visitors_countto assess how many visitors from a single domain. These computations are based on your events and event properties that you are sending through Segment on thepageandtrackcalls.
View the table below to better understand how Segment collects custom, computed, and SQL traits.
You can use the Profile explorer (Unify > Profile explorer) to view traits attached to a profile.
Segment currently supports the following types of computed traits:
Event Properties per Computed Trait limit
Segment limits the number of Event Properties on each Computed trait to 10,000. If your Computed Trait exceeds this limit, Segment will not persist any new Event Properties and will drop new trait keys and corresponding values.
An Event Counter trait stores a count of aneventover a period of time. For example, you can create a trait callednumber_logins_90_daysbased on aUser Logged Inevent. You can also use event properties to only specific types of events.
User-level examples:
Account-level examples:

An aggregation computes asum, average, minimum, or maximumof a numericevent property. A good example is asum_cosmetics_revenue_90_daysif you’re sending anOrder Completedevent with arevenueproperty. In the example we’re refining the revenue even further based on another event property:category = 'cosmetics'. Note that you can only compute an aggregation trait for event properties that have a numeric value.
User-level examples:
Account-level use cases

A most frequent user-level computed trait will return themost common valuefor anevent property.  This is  helpful to create traits likepreferred_product_viewedormost_commonly_viewed_categorythat tell you what a user’s preferred product, or content category might be. Note that the most frequent computed trait requires the event property to have been tracked at least twice. In the case of a tie, Segment returns the first alphabetical value. For account-level computed traits, you can also return the most frequentuser trait. This is helpful when you want to determine which user has performed an event the most frequently. For example, you might to return the email of the user in an account most actively viewing your app.
User-level examples:
Account-level examples:

The first user-level trait returns the first event property value Segment has seen. This is common for creating traits likefirst_page_visitedbased on the page name. For accounts, the first computed trait could also return a trait likefirst_user_signup, to calculate the first user to use your product.
User-level examples:
Account-level examples:

The last trait returns the last event property value Segment has seen. This is common for creating traits likelast_utm_campaignto help you calculate last-touch attribution for paid advertising.
User-level examples:
Account-level examples:

Unique list computed traits will output alist of unique valuesin alphabetical order for anevent property. This is helpful to understand the different types of products or content that a customer or users in an account have interacted with or purchased. Customers are creating traits likeunique_product_categories_viewedand sending them to email marketing tools and accessing them through the Profiles API for in-app personalization.
Example use cases:

Unique list count computed traits will output acount of the unique list of valuesfor anevent property. Customers are creating traits likeunique_product_categories_viewed_countto understand the variety of products that a customer is viewing. At the account-level, customers are creating traits likeunique_visitors_countto calculate the number of unique visitors by ip address.
User-level examples:
Account-level examples:

All computed trait types support a common “Add Conditions” section. Conditions defined here restrict the messages considered when calculating the final value of the computed trait by looking at a property of the events. For example, you could limits events to only those where “price” is greater than 30.00 or where “page.url” contains “pricing”.
The following operators are available.
Segment sends user-level computed Traits to destinations using theIdentify callfor user traits, or using theTrack callfor event properties. Segment includes the trait value and property in the identify and track calls.
For example, the name of a computed trait is added to the user profile as a trait, and the trait’s value is set to the value of the computed trait. Segment sends an identify or track call when the trait is computed, depending on the destination configuration. If a computed trait counts the number of times a user visits your pricing page, and the user visits your pricing page five times, Segment sends an identify call with the propertypricing_page_visits: 5.
Learn more aboutComputed trait generated events here. The trait name corresponds to the snake cased name that you see in the trait settings, for examplemost_viewed_page_category. See thelist of Engage-compatible destinations
For account-level computed traits, you have the option to send either agroupcall and/oridentifycall. Group calls will send one event per account, whereas identify calls will send an identify call for each user in the account. This means that even if a user hasn’t performed an event, Segment will still set the account-level computed trait on that user. Because most marketing tools are still based at the user level, it is often important to map this account-level trait onto each user within an account. SeeAccount-level Audiencesfor more information.
After you create a computed trait, use the Overview page to view a compute progress bar, currentstatus, number of users with the trait, connected destinations, and more. For real-time traits, clickRefresh Traitto update the current number of users with the trait.
Viewing compute progress
When you create a real-time computed trait, you’ll see a progress bar, computed percentage, and status updates. For existing traits that you edit, Segment displays the compute status but not the progress bar or percentage.
Segment supports the editing of real-time Traits, which allows you to make nuanced changes to existing Traits in situations where cloning or building from scratch may not suit your use case.
To edit a real-time Trait, follow these steps:
Segment then processes your Trait edits. While the edit task runs, the trait remains locked and you can’t make further changes. Once Segment incorporates your changes, you’ll be able to access your updated Trait.
It is not possible to edit a trait to convert it from real-time to batch, or vice-versa. If the computation type needs to be changed, you will need to recreate the trait with the appropriate conditions.
You can access your computed traits using the Profile API by querying the/traitsendpoint. For example, you can query for theemails_opened_last_30_dayswith the following GET request:
returns:
TraitsYou can query a user’s traits (such asfirst_name,last_name, and more):
https://profiles.segment.com/v1/spaces/<space_id>/collections/users/profiles/<external_id>/traits
By default, the response includes 20 traits. You can return up to 200 traits by appending?limit=200to the querystring. If you wish to return a specific trait, append?include={trait}to the querystring (for example,?include=age). You can also use the?class=audience​or?class=computed_trait​URL parameters to retrieve audiences or computed traits specifically.
You can read thefull Profile API docsto learn more.
You can download a copy of your trait by visiting the the computed trait overview page.Computed Trait CSVs are generated on demand. Before you can download the CSV, you will need to generate it. There are three different options for formatting:
You can’t add account traits and identifiers using the CSV downloader with account level audiences. This is because every row listed in the CSV file is a user, and since account traits and identifiers only exist on accounts, they wouldn’t exist as a user’s custom trait and appear on the CSV.

Crawling: https://segment.com/docs/unify/traits/custom-traits/
Paragraphs:
On this page
Custom traits are user or account traits collected from the Identify calls you send to Segment. For example, these could be demographics likeageorgender, account-specific likeplan, or even things like whether a user has seen a particular A/B test variation. From your sources, send custom traits as pieces of information that you know about a user in an Identify call.
As opposed tocomputed traitswhich are computed from your source data, orSQL Traitswhich are computed from warehouse data, custom traits are created from source events you pass into Segment and have no trait limits.
View the table below to better understand how Segment collects custom, computed, and SQL traits.
You can use the Profile explorer (Unify > Profile explorer) to view traits attached to a profile.
Here’s the payload of a typical Identify call with custom traits (with mostcommon fieldsremoved):
And here’s the corresponding JavaScript event that would generate the above payload:
Any source event where there’s atraitsobject and key value pairs generates custom traits.
Custom traits are mutable and update to the latest value seen by the user’s Identify events.
When an audience that previously generated Identify events is deleted, the data for the audience key is still attached to profiles that entered the audience and becomes visible in Segment as a custom trait.
Segment has reserved some custom traits that have semantic meanings for users, and will handle them in special ways. For example, Segment always expectsemailto be a string of the user’s email address. Segment sends this on to destinations likeMailchimpthat require an email address for their tracking.
Only use reserved custom traits for their intended meaning.
Reserved custom traits Segment has standardized:

SQL Traits End of Sale
SQL Traits entered End of Sale as of March 31, 2024. Existing Segment customers will continue to have access to SQL Traits, but Segment will no longer offer SQL Traits to new customers. Segment recommends usingReverse ETLto sync your data into Segment.
Use SQL Traits to import user or account traits from your data warehouse back into Unify or Engage to build audiences or to enhance data that you send to other Destinations.
SQL Traits are only limited by the data in your warehouse. Because anything you can write a query for can become a SQL Trait, you can add detail to your user and account profiles, resulting in more nuanced personalization.
This unlocks some interesting possibilities to help you meet your business goals.
Check out Segment’sSQL Traits blog postfor more customer case studies.
To view SQL Traits in a user profile, you must havePII access. Without this access, Segment redacts all SQL traits in a profile.
Note that after you bring in data with SQL Traits, changing data types for fields may not be compatible with all destinations.
SQL Traits allow you to import data fromobject cloud sourceslike Salesforce, Stripe, Zendesk, Hubspot, Marketo, Intercom, and more. For example, bring in Salesforce Leads or Accounts, Zendesk ticket behavior, or Stripe LTV calculations.
The two examples below show SQL queries you can use to retrieve cloud-source information from your warehouse.
Salesforce lead import
If you want to import data from the Salesforce leads and contacts table, you can use SQL similar to the following query:
Has Open Ticket in Zendesk
This query computes whether a user has an open ticket:
View the table below to better understand how Segment collects custom, computed, and SQL traits.
You can use the Profile explorer (Unify > Profile explorer) to view traits attached to a profile.
To use SQL Traits, you need the following:
Segment supports Redshift, Postgres, Snowflake, Azure SQL, and BigQuery as data warehouse sources for SQL Traits. Note that the BigQuery setup processrequiresa service user.
Safeguard your data
For any warehouse, Segment recommends that you create a separate read-only user for building SQL Traits.
If you don’t already have a data warehouse, use one of the following guides to get started:
To connect BigQuery to Segment SQL Traits, follow these instructions to create a service account for Segment to use:
Navigate to the Google Developers Console.
Click the drop down to the left of the search bar and select the project that you want to connect.
Note: If you don’t see the project you want in the menu, click the account switcher in the upper right corner, and verify that you’re logged in to the right Google account for the project.
Click the menu in the upper left and selectIAM & Admin, thenService accounts.
ClickCreate Service Account.
Give the service account a name likesegment-sqltraits.
UnderProject Role, addonlytheBigQuery Data ViewerandBigQuery Job Userroles.
IMPORTANT: Do not add any other roles to the service account. Adding other roles can prevent Segment from connecting to the account.
ClickCreate Key.
SelectJSONand clickCreate.
A file with the key is saved to your computer. Save this; you’ll need it to set up the warehouse source in the next step.
You’re now ready to create a new BigQuery warehouse source, upload the JSON key you just downloaded, and complete the BigQuery setup.
Once your warehouse is up and running, follow these steps:
Navigate to the Engage settings (Engage > Engage Settings > Warehouse Sources), and clickAdd Warehouse Source.
Select the type of warehouse you’re connecting.
In the next screen, provide the connection credentials, and clickSave.
If you’re connecting a BigQuery warehouse, use the JSON key file that you downloaded as the last step.
Before you create a SQL Trait, you must first preview it to validate your query. If you’re new to SQL, try out one of the templates Segment offers.
From the Audiences viewer, go to the Computed Traits tab, and clickNew Computed Trait. Next, choose SQL, and clickConfigure. Select the data warehouse that contains the data you want to query.
If you’re sending data fromobject cloud sourcesto your warehouse, the SQL Traits UI has some pre-made templates you can try out.
When you’re building your query, keep the following requirements in mind for the data your query returns.
A successful preview returns a sample of users and their traits.
If Segment recognizes a user already in Engage, it displays a green checkmark on their profile. Clicking the checkmark displays the user’s profile. If a user has a question mark, Segment hasn’t detected thisuser_idin Engage before.
Once you’re ready to import the SQL Trait, select the Destinations to which you want to send the data.  If you prefer to build Engage audiences directly from the data instead of sending it to a Destination, clickSkip.
Give your SQL Trait a descriptive name. If you’re importing multiple Traits, use a name like “Zendesk Traits”. The Trait names you use in audience-building or in your downstream tools correspond to the column names from the query.
If you’re building Engage audiences from this data, select “Compute without enabled destinations”.
ClickCreate Computed Traitto save the Trait.
CheckCompute without destinationsif you only want to send to Engage.
When you create a SQL Trait, Segment runs the query on the warehouse twice a day by default. You can customize the time at which Segment queries the data warehouse and  the frequency, up to once per hour, from the SQL Trait’s settings.
For each row (user or account) in the query result, Engage sends an identify or group call with all the columns that were returned as Traits. For example, if you write a query that returnsuser_id, has_open_ticket, num_tickets_90_days, avg_zendesk_rating_90daysSegment sends an identify call with the following payload:
Yes. The result set is capped at 25 million rows.
For each SQL Trait you create, you can set a compute schedule to query the data warehouse up to once per hour. Your query may run at any given time during the hour you select.
You can query based onemail,user_id, oranonymous_id. If Segment doesn’t locate a match based on the chosen identifier, it creates a new profile. See more below.
Yes. The Engage engine sends an identify call if there is no match between the identifier you chose and an existing record. When this happens, Segment creates a new user profile. This identify call takes place in the back-end and doesn’t show up in your Debugger.
No. Engage only sends an identify/track/group call if the values in a row have changed from previous runs.
If you’re importing a large list of users and traits, you’ll need to consider your API call usage as well as volume among the partners receiving your data. These vary depending on Segment’s partners,contact supportfor more information.
Yes, Segment limits request sizes to a maximum of 16KB. Records larger than this are discarded.
No, SQL Traits supports string and numeric data types. You can cast arrays as a comma-separated string. In this case, if you used this trait to build an audience, you could check if the array contains a certain value with the “contains” operator, but the value is sent to any connected destinations as a string.
After a SQL trait has been created, you can’t change its Warehouse Source. You’ll need to create a new trait if you want to change the Warehouse source.
If a user was present in one computation, but it is no longer present in the following one, the SQL trait will detect this difference and nullify all trait values for the user.Contact Segmentif you have a use case which calls for an exemption from this default behavior.
You might encounter apermission denied for schemaerror, like the following:
Segment usually displays this error because you’re querying a schema and table that the current user cannot access. To check the table privileges for a specific grantee (user), view the credentials of the stored warehouse user.
To grant access to a table, an admin usually needs to grant access to both a schema and table through the following similar commands:
Learn more about granting permissions using the following links:
Segment supports returning only 25 columns.Contact Segmentwith a description of your use case if you need access to more than 25 columns.
Each query row must correspond to a unique user. Segment displays this error if it detects multiple rows with the sameuser_id. Use adistinctorgroup bystatement to ensure that each row has a unique user_id.
Question marks in previews indicate one of two things:
1. Segment doesn’t recognize thisuser_id/group_idin Engage.
In this case, for sources connected to Engage, Segment hasn’t received any event (for example, identify, track, or page) with thisuser_id. This could still be a legitimateuser_idfor a number of reasons, but before syncing, make sure you rule out option two (below), as sending a different identifier as theuser_idcan corrupt your identity graph.
2. You have the wronguser_idcolumn.
You might be returning a value foruser_idthat’s inconsistent with how you trackuser_idelsewhere. Some customers want to returnemailas theuser_id, or a partner’s tool ID as theuser_id. These conflict with Segment best practices and corrupt the identity graph if you then trackuser_iddifferently elsewhere in your apps.
If you see only question marks in the preview, and have already tracked data historically with Segment, then you likely have the wrong column. If your cloud source doesn’t have the databaseuser_id, Segment recommends using aJOINclause with an internal users table before sending the results back to Segment.
Segment added the compute schedule feature on Feb 8, 2021, so traits created prior to this date will not have this option. If your trait lacks this feature, recreating it will make it available.
Check that you’ve configured the identifier that uniquely identifies users in a SQL query (user_id,anonymous_id,email, orgroup_idfor account traits) in Identity Resolution settings as an identifier. This ensures the trait is added to the user’s profile with the correct identifier. If you don’t configure the identifier in Identity Resolution settings, the trait’s value is not added to the user profile.
Ensure that the name given to the SQL trait is not the same name as the identifier or column name from the query. To use SQL traits to update an identifier, the identifier will need to be a column in the query of your SQL trait. The column name in the query of the SQL trait should be the one that Identity Resolution uses to generate the identifier.
If you experience issues saving the SQL Trait query or previewing the results of the SQL Trait query, open the browser’s Console and Network tabs to see if any errors occurred upon clicking the Save/Preview buttons. If you find any errors, please expand the error and take a screenshot of it. You can then share these details when creating a support ticket.
To see error messages in SQL traits, you will need to have PII Access.
The SQL Trait edit will apply to its next scheduled computational run. If the edit was made too closely to its next scheduled run, then its changes will be applied to the subsequent scheduled run, at which point you’ll see those updates reflected on its user’s profiles.
The SQL Trait resync will apply to its next scheduled computational run. If the resync was made too closely to its next scheduled run, then its changes will be applied to the subsequent scheduled run, at which point you’ll see those updates reflected on its user’s profiles.

With Recommended Items, you can add personalized item recommendations as acomputed traitto each user profile.
Based on a user’s past interactions, this trait generates a list of up to 5 items, like products, articles, or songs, that each user is most likely to engage with.
Segment designed Recommended Items for cases where you want to personalize experiences, like email content, in-app recommendations, or website suggestions, to fit each user’s unique preferences.
On this page, you’ll learn how Recommended Items works, how to create a Recommended Item trait, and best practices to get the most out of your recommendations.
.
Recommended Items uses your interaction events (likeorder_completed,product_added, andproduct_searched) along with event metadata to generate personalized recommendations for each user. Here’s an overview of the process:
Once Segment attaches the recommendation array to a profile, you can use it to:
Before you begin
Before you create Recommended Item traits, you’ll first need to set up a Recommendation Catalog. The catalog setup process involves mapping your interaction events and providing product metadata to support recommendations. If you haven’t yet set up your Recommendation Catalog, follow the steps in theProduct Based Audiences documentation.
To create a Recommended Item trait:
Segment begins creating your new trait. This process could take up to 48 hours.
Suppose you’re managing a music streaming app and want to give each user personalized music recommendations based on their listening habits.
Here’s how you could configure this trait:
By setting up a trait like this, each user profile now includes personalized recommendations that reflect individual tastes. You can use these recommendations across a range of touchpoints, like in-app sections, personalized email content, or targeted messaging, to create a more engaging and customized user experience.
Keep the following in mind as you work with Recommended Items:

Paragraphs:
Unify requires a Business tier account and is included with Engage.See theavailable plans, orcontact Support.

The Segment Profile API provides a single API to read user-level and account-level customer data. Segment now allows you to query the entire user or account object programmatically, including theexternal_ids,traits, andeventsthat make up a user’s journey through your product.
You can use this API to:
This document has four parts:
Important: The Profile API is intended to be used server-side. You should not implement directly in client applications. See theBest Practicessection for more details.
Your access token enables you to call the Profile API and access customer data.
European Union requirements
To implement the Profile API in the European Union, you must complete the following steps within an EU workspace. View theregional Segment documentationfor more information.
Navigate to the API access settings pageUnify > Unify settings > API access.
Create yourAccess Tokenwith a name that describes your use case, for exampletesting/development. Take note of thespace IDvalue, you’ll pass this into the Profile API request URL in a later step.
ClickGenerate token. Copy the resultingAccess Tokenand store it in a file on your computer. You’ll pass in theAccess Tokeninto the Profile API for authorization as an HTTP Basic Auth username in a later step.
To query phone numbers that contain a plus sign (+), insert the escape characters%2Bin place of the plus sign.
For example, if aphone_numberidentifier has the value+5555550123, enterphone_number:%2B5555550123in your query.
If the field you’re using within the Profile API endpoint contains a value with a non-alphanumeric character, then the Profile API may respond with500error. In this case, seeW3’s ASCII Encoding Refernece, which lists the escape characters you can use to replace the non-alphanumeric character in the Profile API endpoint so that the Profile API will respond with a200 Success.
Prepare the request URL by replacing<space_id>and<external_id>in the request URL:https://profiles.segment.com/v1/spaces/<space_id>/collections/users/profiles/<external_id>/traits
If you’re using the Profile API in the EU, use the following URL for all requests:
https://profiles.euw1.segment.com/v1/spaces/<space_id>/collections/users/profiles/<external_id>/traits
The response is returned as a JSON object which contains the queried user’s assigned traits.
Search by an External ID: You can query directly by a user’s user_id or other external_id.
https://profiles.segment.com/v1/spaces/<space_id>/collections/users/profiles/<user_identifier>/events
External IDs: You can query all of a user’s external IDs such asanonymous_idoruser_id.
https://profiles.segment.com/v1/spaces/<space_id>/collections/users/profiles/<user_identifier>/external_ids
TraitsYou can query a user’s traits (such asfirst_name,last_name, and more):
https://profiles.segment.com/v1/spaces/<space_id>/collections/users/profiles/<external_id>/traits
By default, the response includes 20 traits. You can return up to 200 traits by appending?limit=200to the querystring. If you wish to return a specific trait, append?include={trait}to the querystring (for example?include=age). You can also use the?class=audience​or?class=computed_trait​URL parameters to retrieve audiences or computed traits specifically.
MetadataYou can query all of a user’s metadata (such ascreated_at,updated_at, and more):
https://profiles.segment.com/v1/spaces/<space_id>/collections/users/profiles/<external_id>/metadata
Search an account profile
If you’re sending group calls to Segment, you can now access your account profiles as well. Retrieve your account traits, computed traits, and audience traits by querying thegroup_idyou are interested in:
https://profiles.segment.com/v1/spaces/<space_id>/collections/accounts/profiles/group_id:12345/traits
Search for linked users or accounts
If you’re looking to find all the users linked to an account, you can search for an account’s linked users, or a user’s linked accounts.
https://profiles.segment.com/v1/spaces/<space_id>/collections/accounts/profiles/group_id:12345/links
The return limit for the/linksendpoint is 20 records, which you can request by appending?limit=20to the query string.
You can also request using cURL:
The Segment API is organized aroundREST. The API has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. Segment uses standard HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which are understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients.JSONis returned by all API responses, including errors.
Endpoint
European Union endpoint
The Profile API uses basic authentication for authorization — with theAccess Tokenas the authorization key. YourAccess Tokencarries access to all of your customer data, so be sure to keep them secret. Don’t share your Access Token in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub or client-side code.
You can create your Access Secret in your Unify settings page. Segment recommends that you name your tokens with the name of your app and its environment, such asmarketing_site/production. Access tokens are shown once — you won’t be able to see it again. In the event of a security incident, you can revoke and cycle the access token.
When you make requests to the Profile API, use the Access Token as the basic authentication username and keep the password blank. Base64 is a requirement for authentication. If you use a tool like Postman, or if you use the-uflag in a cURL request, this encoding occurs automatically. Otherwise, you’ll need to use Base64 to manually encode your Access Token.
If you’re using a Segment Function or Node.js you can format your header object to include authentication, like so:
Segment uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the2xxrange indicate success, codes in the4xxrange indicate an error that failed given the information provided (for example, a required parameter was omitted), and codes in the5xxrange indicate an error with Segment’s servers.
HTTP Status
Error Body
To ensure low response times, every Space has a default rate limit of 100 requests/sec. Please contactfriends@segment.comif you need a higher limit with details around your use case. For more information about rate limits, see theProduct Limitsdocumentation.
All top-level API resources have support for bulk fetches using “list” API methods. For instance you can list profiles, a profile’s events, a profile’s traits, and a profile’s external_ids. These list API methods share a common structure, taking at least two parameters:nextandlimit.
Each API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, underRequest-Id.
If you need to contact Segment regarding a specific API request, please capture and provide theRequest-Id.
The Profile API supports the following routes. These routes are appended the Profile API request URL:
Retrieve a single profile’s traits within a collection using anexternal_id. For example, two different sources can set a differentfirst_namefor a user. The traits endpoint will resolve properties from multiple sources into a canonical source using the last updated precedence order.
This example retrieves a profile’s traits by an external id, like ananonymous_id:
Or auser_id:
Request
404 Not Found
200 OK
With?verbose=trueenabled:
Get a single profile’s external ids within a collection using anexternal_id.
Request
404 Not Found
200 OK
Get up to 14 days of a profile’s historical events within a collection using anexternal_id.
Request

200 OK
Get a single profile’s metadata within a collection using anexternal_id.
Request
404 Not Found
200 OK
Get the users linked to an account, or accounts linked to a user, using anexternal_id.
Request
404 Not Found
200 OK
The Profile API doesn’t support CORS because it has access to the sum of a customer’s data. Segment also requests that you prevent the Access Token to the public, for example in a client-side application. Engineers implementing this API are advised to create a personalization service in their infrastructure, which other apps, websites, and services communicate with to fetch personalizations about their users.

If you want to display the most relevant blog posts given a reader’s favorite blog category:
Users who take a few minutes to read through an article on the blog will find posts recommended using their historical reading pattern including the post they just read.
Segment does not recommend usingexternal_idsas a lookup field that might contain personally identifiable information (PII), because this can make its way into your server logs that can be hard to find and remove. For this reason, Segment recommends against usingemailas anexternal_idfor Profile API use cases.
Segment typically sees p95 response times under 200ms for the/traitsendpoint, based on an in-region test inus-westto retrieve 50 traits. However, if you know which traits you’re looking for, Segment suggests you use the/traits?include=parameter to provide a list of traits you want to retrieve.
Another best practice to optimize performance in high-throughput applications is to use connection pooling. Your personalization service should share existing connections when making a request to the Profile API, instead of opening and closing a connection for each request. This additional TLS handshake is a common source of overhead for each request.
Segment recommends against blocking the page render to wait for a third party API’s response, as even small slow down can impact the page’s conversion performance. Instead, Segment recommends you to asynchronously request the data from after the page loads and use a server-to-server request for the necessary computed traits. Resulting computed traits can be cached for the second page load.

The Profile Source Debugger enables you to inspect and monitor events that Segment sends downstream.
Because Segment generates a unique source for every destination connected to a Space, the Debugger gives you insight into how Segment sends events before they reach their destination. Even when a destination is removed, you can’t delete and shouldn’t disable this source for Segment to function as designed. The source will be reused by Segment as needed.
The Debugger provides you with the payload information you need to troubleshoot potential formatting issues and ensure Segment sends events as your destinations expect.
Modifying or disabling these system-generated sources could result in unforeseen issues and data loss.
Turning off these sources might impede profile updates, while removing them could compromise the stability of the Engage space, potentially making it irrecoverable. To ensure the system’s integrity, Segment highly recommends leaving these sources enabled.
Navigate to the Debugger tab on the Unify settings page of the space you want to debug. Select the source you want to inspect in the Debugger.
The Debugger presents a stream of incoming events. The event inspector displays three tabs for each event:
Similar to the Connections Debugger, you can search through events using information contained within the event’s payload.

AllSegment GDPR featuresapply to Unify.
Segment never shares or sells user data. Unify inherits Segment’s holistic approach to security and privacy, using 256-bit AES standard encryption to safeguard data stores both at rest and in transit.
End-user privacy and the GDPR principles informed the design of Unify, a product powered by first-party data. Unify integrates Segment’s existing end-user privacy features with several user rights:
Below, learn how each of these rights protects the integrity of users and their data.
Using Segment’s platform, you canmanage user deletionacross all Segment products and supported Destinations. User deletion requests remove user data from all internal Segment archives and environments, including Engage audiences, within 30 days.
Withone-click suppression, you can block data collection for specific users. Segment discontinues profile building around suppressed users and prevents them from joining future audiences.
When Segment receives new information, the platform updates user profiles and traits in both Segment and its downstream tools. Use theProfile APIto confirm that an update has been processed.
Identity Resolutionconnects information you’ve gathered about a customer into a single profile. Using the Profile API, you can provide end users with this data. You can also enable raw data integrations and warehouses to share a user’s data in a structured format.
Visit the Segment site to learnhow Segment products simplify GDPR compliance, and reference Segment’scomplying with the GDPRdocumentation to incorporateGDPR best practicesinto your workflow.

If you want Identity Graph to operate on a different custom ID, you can pass it in usingcontext.externalIdson anIdentifyorTrack call. If you’re interested in this feature, contact your CSM to discuss the best way to implement this feature.
Segment analyzes each incoming event and extracts external IDs (likeuser_id,anonymous_id,email). The simplified algorithm works as follows:
All Profile matching is deterministic and based on first-party data that you’ve collected.
Segment doesn’t support probabilistic matching. Most marketing automation use cases require 100% confidence that a user is who you think they are (sending an email, delivering a recommendation, and so on). The best way to support this is through a deterministic identity algorithm.
If two merged user profiles contain conflicting profile attributes, Segment selects the newest, or last updated, attributes when querying the profile.
Any of the external IDs can be used to query a profile. When a profile is requested, Segment traverses the merge graph and resolves all merged profiles. The result is a single profile, with the latest state of all traits, events, and identifiers.
No. As the Identity Graph uses external IDs, they remain for the lifetime of the user profile.
No. Alternatively, you may delete the entire user profile from Segment using aGDPR deletion request.
Segment determines the Monthly Tracked Users (MTUs) count by the number of unique user IDs and anonymous IDs processed, regardless of how you manage these profiles in Unify and Engage. This count is taken as events are sent to Segment, before they reach Unify and Engage. Therefore, the creation of new profiles or the merging of profiles in Unify doesn’t affect the MTU count. The MTU count only increases when you send new unique user or anonymous IDs to Segment.
TheProfile Explorerretains event details for a period of up to 2 weeks. If you need event information beyond this timeframe, Segment recommends usingProfiles Syncfor comprehensive event analysis and retention.
Yes, you can remove a trait from a user profile by sending an Identify event with the trait value set tonullin the traits object from one of your connected sources. For example:
Setting the trait value to an empty string won’t remove the trait, like in this example:
Instead, this updates the trait to an empty string within the user profile.

Powered by real-time data, Twilio Engage is a customizable personalization platform with which you can build, enrich, and activate Audiences.
Engage Channels builds on top of these Audiences, helping you connect with and market to your customers through email, SMS, and WhatsApp campaigns.
Engage usesSegment Identity Resolutionto take event data from across devices and channels and intelligently merge it into complete user- or account-level profiles. This gives your organization a single view of your customer base. To learn more, read theIdentity Resolution documentation.
Support teams rely on Segment's unified profiles to make real-time and informed decisions about customers when answering tickets or taking support calls. Read about how the support team at Frame.io reduced ticket response time by 80%.
Add detail to user profiles with new traits and use them to power personalized marketing campaigns. You can add new traits to your user or account profiles in Engage using:
Create lists of users or accounts that match specific criteria. For example, after creating aninactive accountsaudience that lists paid accounts with no logins in 60 days, you can push the audience to your analytics tools or send an SMS, email, or WhatsApp campaign with Engage Channels. Learn more aboutEngage audiences.
Once you create your Computed Traits and Audiences, Engage sends them to your Segment Destinations in just a few clicks. You can use these Traits and Audiences to personalize messages across channels, optimize ad spend, and improve targeting. You can also use theProfile APIto build in-app and onsite personalization. Learn more aboutusing Engage dataand theProfile API.
Marketing teams use Engage to run real-time multi-channel marketing campaigns based off specific user attributes they've computed in Engage. Read about how Drift used Engage to increase prospect engagement by 150% in two months.
To send email, SMS, and WhatsApp campaigns with Engage Channels, you’ll connect aTwilio messaging service,SendGrid subuser account, andWhatsApp messaging serviceto your Segment Engage space. Use existing accounts, or create new ones.

This guide walks you through the set up process for a simplified Engage space. If your implementation is complex, use this to demonstrate and test Engage before working on a more complex configuration.
The first four steps in this guide also apply to Unify set up. To learn more, visit theUnify Onboarding Guide.
Regional Segment
Engage Foundations is available on Segment’s regional infrastructure. For more information, see the articleRegional Segment.
Engage requires bothConnectionsandUnify.
The following are prerequisites to configuring and using Engage:
When you first start working with Engage, start by creating a “Developer” Engage space. This is your experimental and test environment while you learn more about how Engage works.
Invite teammates to your Engage dev space and grant them access to the space. Navigate toAccess Managementin your workspace settings to add them.
```Segment Source Details:
Details for replay:
All the events or only a subset of event names? Provide event names and/or method calls (page/identify/track/group) if only a subset of events is needed.
```
To learn more, visitConnect production sources.
After the replay finishes, you can see the data replayed into Engage using the Profile Explorer. Visit theProfiles Onboarding Guidefor more info.
You can build an audience using any source data that flows into your Engage space.
In this step, use the Audience Builder UI to create an Audience using properties you’re familiar with. For example, you might know the number of new website user signups in the last seven days, if you’ve connected your production website source to Engage.
To build your own audience:
After you build your audience, clickPreview Resultsto see the total number of users who meet the audience criteria, for example all users who signed up within the last seven days.
After you create your test audience, clickSelect Destinations. Engage guides you through configuration steps to set up a destination for your audience. If you don’t already have destinations configured for the Engage space, you are prompted to select one or more. Finally, enter a name for the audience.
The larger the audience you’re creating, the longer it takes Engage to successfully compute the Audience. The Audience page shows a status that indicates if the audience is still being calculated. When the total number of users appears in the Audience overview, as in the example screenshot below, the audience has successfully finished computing, and Engage then sends the audience to the destination you selected.

Audiences are either sent to destinations as a boolean user-property (for exampleNew_Users_7days=trueor a user-list, depending on what the destination supports. Read more aboutwhich destinations support which types of data.
The UIs for the destination tools you send the audience data to are different, so the process of validating the audience varies per tool. However, the guiding principle is the same. You should be able to identify the full group of users who are members of your audience in your destination.
After you validate that your full audience is arriving in your destination, you’re ready to create a Production space. Segment recommends that you repeat the same steps outlined above, focusing on your production use cases and data sources.

Twilio Marketing Campaigns
Preferred ISV Partners:
Airship BlogBloomreach BlogBraze BlogInsider BlogKlaviyo BlogTwilio Engage Foundations Documentation
Twilio Engage brings Segment, Twilio, SendGrid, and WhatsApp together to help you create and send email, SMS, and WhatsApp campaigns to your customers.
Before sending your first Engage campaign, though, you’ll need to configure and connect accounts with all four platforms.
This guide lists all required onboarding steps and walks you through Engage setup. By the end of the onboarding process, you’ll be ready to send your first campaign.
The steps in this guide are only required if you plan to send email, SMS, and WhatsApp messages with Engage. Visit theEngage Foundations Onboarding Guidefor general onboarding steps to set up your Engage space, connect sources, create audiences, and more.
Regional Segment
You can use Engage Premier onSegment’s regional infrastructure in the EU. Twilio Engage ensures data residency in the EU, but the channels you connect to, may not guarantee the same level of data residency. Check directly with the providers of the channels you use for information about data residency in their applications. Native channels like email and SMS, which use Twilio, are not data resident.
Twilio is GDPR compliant, and hasBinding Corporate Rulesto ensure that data is protected when it’s transferred between countries.
You’ll set up Twilio Engage in four stages:
The following table shows a high-level checklist of tasks you’ll need to complete in each platform:
Several onboarding steps require copying and pasting information between Segment and SendGrid or Twilio. To streamline setup, open your Segment workspace in one browser tab and open two others for tasks you’ll carry out in SendGrid and Twilio.
Continue reading for a detailed, step-by-step breakdown of each onboarding stage.
Throughidentity resolution, Segment uses thephoneandemailtraits to identify users who can receive your Engage campaigns. To begin using Engage, you’ll need to verify that these identifiers exist in your workspace and add them if they don’t.
Follow these steps to configure the traits:
Your Segment workspace is now configured for Engage.  Next, you’ll create a SendGrid account and connect it to Segment.
SendGrid powers delivery of your Engage email campaigns. During this stage of onboarding, you’ll create and set up a SendGrid Pro account. You’ll then configure SendGrid and Engage to enable both subscription tracking and an event webhook.
Start by creating a SendGrid account and then upgrading to the SendGrid Pro Plan:
Upgrading to SendGrid Pro
Upgrading to a SendGrid Pro account may require additional action on your part. Follow the instructions inSendGrid’s account upgrade guideto complete your upgrade.
Next, you’llcreate a SendGrid subuserand ensure that a dedicated IP has been assigned:
In theCreate New Subuserwindow, create a username for the subuser, then add an email address and password. Your SendGrid subuser username must begin with the prefixtwilio_engage_app_. Add a unique identifier to the end of the prefix, for example,twilio_engage_app_someusername.

SendGrid parent account
In this section, you’ll authenticate your domain and set up reverse DNS with your SendGrid parent account.
Now, you’ll authenticate your domain with SendGrid and your DNS provider andenable link branding. Domain authentication protects your sending reputation by showing email providers that you’ve given SendGrid permission to send email campaigns for you.
To authenticate your domain, you’ll copy CNAME records given to you by SendGrid and paste them into your DNS provider.Before you begin, verify that you have the necessary permissions to add CNAME records to your DNS.If you’re not sure if you have the right permissions, reach out to your organization’s IT department.
You’ll authenticate your domain using the SendGrid platform and your DNS provider:
Complete authentication by setting up reverse DNS:
You’ll also need to enablesubscription tracking, which keeps records of users who unsubscribe from your email campaigns:
Subuser Step
This step takes place in thesubuserspace.
You’ll now need to enable event webhooks, which trigger webhook notifications for campaign-related events like clicks and opens:

Copying SendGrid Credentials
This step creates an API key and API Key ID that you’ll immediately add to Segment. Make sure you’re ready to copy and save the API key before proceeding; SendGrid only displays the API key once. You must follow these steps from within the SendGrid subuser accountyou created for use with Twilio Engage.
Re-using API Keys
It is not possible to re-use API Keys in different Engage spaces. For each space, a new API Key is required.
Now, you’ll generate an API key and API Key ID within SendGrid.With your SendGrid account open in one tab, open yourSegment workspaceopen in another. You’ll need both open to copy and paste the API credentials into your Engage settings.
SendGrid Subuser Step
Carry out the following steps in your SendGridsubuserspace.
To finish linking the API credentials to your Segment account, follow these steps:

If you already send emails regularly on your chosen IP, proceed toStage 3.
To finish configuring your SendGrid account for usage with Twilio Engage, you’llwarm up your IP. IP warmup protects your sender reputation and ensures that you avoid email deliverability issues.
As a best practice,only warm up your IP when you’re ready to begin sending campaigns.
You can enable automated IP warmup by following these steps:
Once you’ve enabled IP warmup, you’re ready to send as many campaigns as you’d like. SendGrid will begin sending your campaigns through a shared pool of IP addresses, including your own. Over the next 30 days, SendGrid will gradually increase the number of campaigns sent through your chosen IP. After 30 days, SendGrid will send all your emails from your dedicated IP.
Keep the following in mind once you’ve enabled automated IP warmup:
Once you’ve completed IP warmup, your SendGrid account will be fully configured and ready to use with Engage.  You’re ready to move to Stage 3 and set up Twilio SMS.
To add the ability to send SMS campaigns in Engage, you’ll now create a Twilio account, set up a phone number and messaging service, and generate an API key.
Phone Number Registration
You’ll need to purchase a phone number to set upTwilio Messaging. Depending on the phone number type you purchase, you may have to register the number. Before completing this section, read Twilio’s documentation onshort code,long code, andtoll free numbers.
Once you’ve identified the type of phone number you’ll use with Twilio Engage, follow these steps to create a Twilio Messaging Service:
Copying Twilio Credentials
This step generates an Account SID, API key SID, and API key secret that you’ll later add to Segment. Make sure you’re ready to copy and save both before proceeding.
Start by creating your Twilio account and getting an API key for Engage:
Copy and save both theSIDandSecretfield contents.

Return to the API keys & tokens page. In theLive credentialssection, copy the Account SID credentials.

UnderEnter your Twilio API Key information(shown below), paste the Account SID, API Key SID, and API Key Secret you copied above into their corresponding fields.

ClickVerify, then select the messaging services you want to use in your space.

If you’re unable to verify your Account SID, SID, or API Key secret, you may have copied an extra space at the end of one or the other. Verify that you’ve not added any extra characters or spaces, then try to verify again.
To send WhatsApp messages in Twilio Engage, you’ll register a Twilio number with WhatsApp, connect your Facebook account, and create a WhatsApp messaging service.
In the Facebook popup from the previous section, carry out these steps:
You’ll now create a messaging service to connect your number to Engage:
Your WhatsApp messaging service is now created.
You can use Engage Premier onSegment’s regional infrastructure in the EU. Twilio Engage ensures data residency in the EU, but the channels you connect to, may not guarantee the same level of data residency. Check directly with the providers of the channels you use for information about data residency in their applications. Native channels like email and SMS, which use Twilio, are not data resident.
Twilio is GDPR compliant, and hasBinding Corporate Rulesto ensure that data is protected when it’s transferred between countries.
With configured accounts and services for all platforms, you’ve completed Engage onboarding and are ready to create and send campaigns to your users.
Not sure where to start? Read the Engage documentation onsending email campaigns,SMS campaigns, andWhatsApp campaigns. To save time when generating Engage campaigns, check out the Engage guides on creatingSMS templates,email templates, andWhatsApp templates.

Knowledge of subscription states will help you understand which users can and cannot receive your campaigns. This page provides an overview of user subscriptions.
Email addresses and phone numbers in your audience have one of the four following user subscription states:
It’s best practice to only send Engage campaigns to users with asubscribedstatus. However, if you need to send an email to someone who hasn’t subscribed, you can create an email campaign that yousend to all users.
To learn how Segment determines user subscription states, read theUser Subscription State documentation.
You can set user subscriptions manually when you upload contactsusing Engage’s CSV uploader. You can also use a CSV upload to correct contacts with outdated subscription states.
Most user subscriptions update programmatically, using Segment APIs. The Public API and the Identify call handle subscription state changes made when users sign up to or change their subscription status to your marketing materials with online forms or within notification centers.

Segment associates auser subscription statewith each email address and phone number in your Engage audiences. Subscription states give you insight into the level of consent a user has given you to receive your Engage campaigns.
You can set a user’s subscription state using a CSV file or, programmatically, using Reverse ETL or Segment’s APIs. On this page, you’ll learn how and when to use these processes.
Setting user subscriptions by uploading a CSV file proves useful when you’re importing batch contacts to Segment for the first time or when you need to change a specific user’s subscription status.
For example, you may want to add contacts to Segment using an audience list sourced from a third-party tool, or you may have gathered a large number of contacts from an in-person event.
To learn how to upload a CSV file to Segment, view theEngage CSV Uploader page.
To change the subscription status of an email or phone number with a CSV file, include at least one of the following user subscription columns next to the contact column:
These columns take the following values:
Engage accepts both uppercase and lowercase subscription status values.
Refer to theUser Subscription States documentationfor detailed explanations of each subscription state.
With Segment’s APIs, you can manage user subscriptions programmatically on a real-time basis. Use the APIs for ongoing subscription status updates, like when users subscribe to your marketing campaigns on a website form or modify their subscription from within a notification center.
To update Engage user subscriptions with Segment’s APIs, first choose betweenthe Identify call, for non-critical subscription updates, or thePublic API, for critical updates that require immediate confirmation, like unsubscribes.
When you use the Identify call, Segment replies with a standard HTTP200 OKstatus response code if it successfully received the request. Because the Identify call updates user traits asynchronously, though, the200 OKcode indicates that Segment has received, but not yet processed, the request. As a result, use the Identify call for non-critical subscription updates, like form signups on your website or adding a subscription from within the user’s notification center.
When you update user subscriptions with Segment’s Public API, however, you’ll get an immediate response that confirms that Segment both received and processed the request. Use the Public API, then, for unsubscribes, so users immediately find out if their subscription updated.
For Segment to process the subscription status request, your Identify call payload must include at least one object that contains an email address or phone number, its subscription type, and its subscription status. Engage accepts both uppercase and lowercase subscription statuses in Identify calls.
The following example payload shows an Identify call with acontextobject, which you’ll add to the Identify call to update user subscriptions. Thecontextobject contains amessaging_subscriptionsarray with three objects that update SMS, WhatsApp, and email subscription statuses:
For successful requests, Segment instantly updates subscription states in your workspace. You can then display successful updates or error messages with users in your notification center.
While SMS and WhatsApp share the same number, you must add a separate subscription state for both of them.
Engage Premier Subscriptions userscan use Reverse ETL to sync subscription data from warehouses to destinations. To get started with using Reverse ETL for managing subscriptions, seeReverse ETL for Engage Premier Subscriptions.

A customer profile, then, may have contact vectors with different subscription states. For example, a customer may consent to receive email campaigns but not SMS campaigns. Subscription states, then, describe permissions at the contact vector level, not at the customer level.
Understanding the four user subscription states helps you improve campaign deliverability and comply with sending guidelines and legislation. This page explains the four subscription states and how each impacts your sending ability.
The following table displays the four subscription states:
You can gain insight into your audience profiles by learning how and why each subscription state is associated with a user’s profile.  Below, you’ll find the four states described in detail, along with common scenarios that produce those states.
Asubscribeduser has, at some point, given you explicit permission to send them your marketing materials.
Subscribed users have intentionally requested to receive your marketing materials and have taken voluntary action to confirm that choice. You may have received this consent from a number of sources, including the following:
It’s your responsibility to ensure that Segment correctly reflects your users’ subscription choices. Failure to do so may put you in violation of legislation likeCAN-SPAM,TCPA, orGDPR.
Anunsubscribeduser has intentionally opted out of receiving your marketing materials. You cannot send Engage campaigns to unsubscribed users.
Users commonly unsubscribe in the following ways:
You must include an unsubscribe option in all Engage email and SMS campaigns.
Users with thedid-not-subscribestate associated with their email address or phone number gave you their contact information without explicitly agreeing to receive your marketing materials.
The following scenarios often lead to an email or phone number with thedid-not-subscribesubscription state:
Emails or phone numbers with adid-not-subscribestatus won’t receive your marketing campaigns.
Profiles withno subscription status, or a blank status, indicate that Segment has created a profile for the user, but that the user never actually provided their contact information. Some situations that lead to theno subscription statusstate include the following:
Some contacts within your Segment space may fall into the no subscription status category.Identity resolution, for example, may result in a user profile created from connecting an email address with an anonymous ID. In this case, the profile would exist within your audience despite the fact that the user never had the option to subscribe or unsubscribe.
You can set subscription states by either CSV file upload or, programmatically, with thePublic API.
Uploading contacts with a CSV file works best for initial batches of contacts you’d like to bring into Engage. Syncing programmatically with the Public API is best suited for real-time and ongoing subscription maintenance, like when a user signs up for a form on your site or unsubscribes from your marketing campaigns within their notification center or account settings.
To learn more about both options, reference the Engage documentation on using theCSV uploaderand setting user subscriptions.
Use SQL to import user subscription states from your data warehouse back to Engage. When you sync with SQL, you can query user subscription data at automated intervals. Pull subscription statuses for each contact vector and use your data warehouse as a single source of truth for subscription data.
This option is especially useful if you don’t have the ability to set subscription states with CSVs or Segment’s Public API.
ViewSubscriptions with SQL Traitsfor more information.
On occasion, a user’s subscription state may not be up-to-date. For example, a user may have unsuccessfully attempted to unsubscribe from your marketing campaigns.
The Public API will resolve most subscribe and unsubscribe requests in real time. In some circumstances, however, you’ll need to take action to update a user’s subscription state.  The following table lists some situations in which you may find a manual update useful:

Subscription groups let your users choose the emails they want to receive from you. This page introduces subscription groups and explains how you can use them withEngage email campaigns.
A subscription group lets you send email campaigns to specific groups of users. Subscription groups also give your customers the ability to manage their email preferences, ensuring they only get emails they want to receive.
For example, you may want to create a subscription group that will receive only promotional email campaigns. Should a customer decide to opt out of your promotional campaigns, they’ll still be able to receive email campaigns from other subscription groups you’ve created and to which they’ve subscribed.
With subscription groups, your customers can opt in and out of groups on an individual basis instead of unsubscribing from all your campaigns.
Your customers will have the chance to opt in and out of subscription groups on both a subscription preferences page and on the landing page that launches when they unsubscribe.
Customers can access these pages through theunsubscribe and manage preference linksthat you include in youremail templates.

To use a subscription group, you’ll need to first create the group, add subscribers, then create a new email template.
Follow these steps to create a subscription group:
In addition to adding group subscribers when you first create a subscription group, you can also add subscribers to existing groups with a CSV file upload with these steps:
The following table lists validation errors you may run into with your CSV upload:

To use subscription groups, you’ll need to create a new email template with new unsubscribe and manage preference links.
Once you’ve created a subscription group and added subscribers to it, follow these steps to send to the group:
Segment supports subscription groups for email. You can send statuses for email subscription groups using theIdentify call.
To set susbcription groups with the Identify call, you’ll need to include a key-value pair of"type": "EMAIL"and thegroupsobject, like in the following sample payload:
Your Engage space includes up to 25 subscription groups.
No. Templates you’ve previously created aren’t compatible with subscription groups. To use subscription groups, you’ll need to create new templates that include new unsubscribe and manage preference links.
If you delete a subscription group, Engage will still maintain the preferences of the group’s end users.
TheEngage Events Sourcetracks four subscription group events:Email Unsubscribed,Email Group Unsubscribed,Channel Subscription Updated, andGroup Subscription Updated.
If a user unsubscribes from all of your subscription groups, they’ll need to re-subscribe by explicitly opting back in to each group.
Yes. Test emails include fully functional unsubscribe and subscription preference links. If a test email recipient unsubscribes using a test email, Segment updates that user’s subscription state.
Test emails temporarily override an email subscription state. This means that an unsubscribed email address can receive a test email but won’t receive regular email campaigns from which they’ve unsubscribed.
Yes. Keep the following table in mind when you name a subscription group:

Use Subscriptions with SQL Traits to connect to your data warehouse and query user subscription data to Engage on a scheduled basis. Use your data warehouse as a single source of truth for subscription statuses and query from warehouses such as BigQuery, Redshift, or Snowflake.
On this page, you’ll learn how to use SQL to sync subscription data from your warehouse to Engage.
Updating subscription statuses with SQL creates new profiles and updates existing profiles. These profile updates may lead to users entering existing audiences or message campaigns.
To use Subscriptions with SQL Traits, you need the following:
Segment supports Redshift, Postgres, Snowflake, Azure SQL, and BigQuery as data warehouse sources for SQL Traits. VisitSegment’s warehouse docsfor more on getting started with data warehouses.
Before you begin with Subscriptions with SQL Traits, you may also want to visit thesubscription docsto learn more about user subscriptions in Engage.
You can sync with SQL from two locations in the Segment app. Navigate toUnify > Profile explorerorEngage > Audiences > Profile explorer, then:
To configure Subscriptions with SQL Traits, you can write your own query or clickUse Templateto use one of the templates Engage provides. For any new users that your query returns, Engage adds a new profile.
ClickReset Templateto reset your SQL query.
Queries must return at least one pair of the columns below with a value ofsubscribed,unsubscribed, ordid_not_subscribe:
For more subscription SQL best practices, view thequery requirementsbelow.
Once you write your SQL query, clickSelect warehousefrom the Configure screen to select the data warehouse you’d like to query.
Before you schedule your sync intervals, clickPreviewto preview a subset of data and validate your results. To see subscription statuses for a particular profile, select a user row, then select the Identities tab.
You can schedule sync intervals to import subscription data from your warehouse to Engage:
SQL queries are executed directly to your data warehouse, which could generate additional costs for pay-per-query warehouses.

Use the CSV Uploader to add or update user subscription states.
When you upload a CSV file, Engage adds new profiles and updates existing user profiles. Each CSV row corresponds to a user profile and columns to an identifier in youridentity resolution configuration.
You can alsoset subscription statesfor each email and phone number that you upload in the CSV. Subscription states help you track which email addresses and numbers you have permission to market to.
Uploading a CSV creates new profiles and updates existing profiles. These profile updates may lead to users entering existing audiences or message campaigns.

Follow these steps to add subscribers with a CSV file upload
ClickDownload Templateto download a CSV template with identifier columns from your identity resolution configuration. Engage adds subscription columns next to email and SMS identifiers, where you can update subscription states for email addresses and phone numbers.
CSV files can only have a singleemailandphoneidentifier column. Include any additional email addresses or phone numbers for a user profile as a separate row.
Navigate toUnify > Unify settingsand select theIdentity resolutiontab to view or add identifiers in your Segment workspace.
Enter values for the identifiers in your CSV file. You can alsoset email, phone, and WhatsApp subscriptionsusing theemail_subscription_status,sms_subscription_status, andwhatsapp_subscription_statuscolumns.
A few best practices to keep in mind as you fill out your CSV:
Upload a CSV file to Twilio Engage in two ways:
Engage processes CSV rows sequentially. Column values, except for a blank subscription status, override previous values for a user profile.
A blank subscription status in the CSV doesn’t overwrite currentemailorphonesubscription statesin your Segment space.
Every time you upload a file, you have the option to add a custom trait to user profiles in the CSV. Use custom traits to help youcreate audiencesor send messages to a specific group of users. You can also add an existing custom trait name from your Segment workspace to the list of users in the CSV file.
Custom traitsdisplay in the Custom Traits tab of a user profile in the Profile explorer.
Use the Update History page to view CSV file uploads in your workspace over the last 30 days.
To view the Update History page:
View the status of the file upload and the custom trait name added to user profiles in the CSV upload. The error report only shows rows that Segment couldn’t successfully process.

Audiences let you group users or accounts based on event behavior and traits that Segment tracks.
You can build Audiences from coretracking events,traits, andcomputed traits. You can then sync Audiences to hundreds ofDestinationsor access them with theProfile API.
You can build an Audience from existing events, traits, computed traits, or other Audiences.
TheInclude Anonymous Userscheckbox determines which external IDs need to exist on a profile for Segment to include the user in the audience:
Editing an audience before the initial backfill is complete can create technical errors.
Audience Keys
Avoid using the same Audience Key twice, even if you’ve deleted the original Audience.
You can build an Audience from any events that are connected to Engage, includingTrack,Page, andScreencalls. You can use thepropertybutton to refine the audience on specific event properties, as well.
The Audience builder doesn’t return every property value in the Constant value or Traits drop-downs. Segment displays a portion of values from the incoming data stream. However, if you don’t see the value you’re looking for, you can manually enter it.
Selectand not whoto indicate users that have not performed an event. For example, you might want to look at all users that have viewed a product above a certain price point but not completed the order.

You can also specify two different types of time-windows,withinandin between. Thewithinproperty lets you specify an event that occurred in the lastxnumber of days, whilein betweenlets you specify events that occurred over a rolling time window in the past. A common use case is to look at all customers that were active 30 to 90 days ago, but have not completed an action in the last 30 days.
You can also build audiences using Custom Traits, Computed Traits, SQL Traits, and audience memberships.
Custom traitsare user or account-specific attributes. You can collect these traits from your apps when a user completes a form or signs up using anIdentify call. You can view these traits in the Profile explorer. Custom Traits are mutable and update to the latest value seen by the user’s Identify events.
When you delete an audience that previously generated Identify events, the data for the audience key stays attached to profiles that entered the audience. This data then becomes visible in Segment as a custom trait.
You can also use computed traits in an audience definition. For example, you can create atotal_revenuecomputed trait and use it to generate an audience ofbig_spendercustomers that exceed a certain threshold.
Engage supports nested traits, but the Audience builder doesn’t support accessing objects nested in arrays. When you send arrays of objects, they are flattened into strings. As a result, the same conditions that work on strings will work on the array. Within the builder, you can only use string operations likecontainsanddoes not containto look for individual characters or a set of characters in the flattened array.
With SQL Traits, you can use data in your warehouse to build an audience. By running SQL queries on this warehouse data, you can import specific traits back into Segment to enhance both Segment audiences and the data you send to downstream destinations.
When you build an audience based on audience membership, you use existing audiences as criteria for creating new audiences. You can include or exclude profiles based on their membership in other audiences, allowing you to generate more specific audience segments.
You can use the following time comparison operators in your audience definition:
Only ISO timestamps can be used with these operators. Additionally, these time comparison operators exclusively apply to custom traits.
If the timestamp is not a valid ISO timestamp (for example, a trailingZis missing), Segment won’t process the audience in real-time. Learn more aboutreal-time compute compared to batch.
Note: Timezones seen in the UI are based on your local timezone, but are converted to UTC on the backend.
Funnel audiences allow you to specify strict ordering between two events. This might be the case if you want an event to happen or not happen within a specific time window, as in the following example:

Dynamic Property references give you more flexibility over funnel audiences. Instead of specifying a constant value in both events, likeproduct_id = 123for both Product Viewed and Order Completed events, you can specify that a child event references an event property of a parent event. You can also compare an event property to a trait variable.

If you have a B2B business, you might want to build an Audience of accounts. You can use both account-level traits that you’ve sent through theGroupcall, or user-level traits and events. For example, you might want to re-engage a list of at-risk accounts defined as companies which are on a business tier plan and where none of the users in that account have logged in recently. When incorporating user-level events or traits, you can specifyNone of the users,Any users, orAll users.
SeeAccount-level Audiencesfor more information.
You can send audiences and computed traits to third-party services in Segment’sDestinations catalog.
For step-by-step instructions on how to connect an audience to a destination, seeSend Audience Data to Destinations.
Because a number of factors (like system load, backfills, or user bases) determine the complexity of an Audience, some compute times take longer than others.
As a result,Segment recommends waiting at least 24 hours for an Audience to finish computingbefore you resume working with the Audience.
From the Overview page, you can view Audience details including the current compute status and a progress bar for real-time and batch Audiences. Engage updates the progress bar and status for real-time computations approximately every 10 minutes.
Viewing compute progress
When you create a real-time Audience, you’ll see a progress bar, computed percentage, and status updates. For existing Audiences that you edit, Engage displays the compute status but not the progress bar or percentage.
Engage syncs the Overview page for an individual audience more frequently than the Engage Audiences page (Engage > Audiences). As a result, you might see temporary discrepancies in Audience details, such as user counts, between these two pages.
For real-time computations, you can clickRefresh AudienceorRefresh Traitto update user counts, status, and compute progress.
Engage displays the following compute statuses for Audiences and Traits.
Real-time Compute allows you to update traits and Audiences as Segment receives new events. Real-time Compute unlocks exciting use cases:
Real-time Compute doesn’t support time window conditions. Segment creates Audiences using time window conditions as batch computations. Additionally, Segment createsFunnel Audiencesas batch computations.
To create a new Audience or Trait:
Go to yourComputed TraitsorAudiencestab in Engage and selectCreate.
While Engage is computing, use the Audience Explorer to see users or accounts that enter your Audience. Engage displays the Audience as computing in the Explorer until at least one user or account enters.
Facebook Custom Audiences,Marketo Lists, andAdwords Remarking Listsimpose rate limits on how quickly Segment can update an Audience. Segment syncs at the highest frequency allowed by the tool, which is between one and six hours.
Real-time computations connected to List destinations use a separate sync process that can take 12-15 hours to send changes present in the most recent computation.
Engage supports the editing of realtime Audiences and Traits, which allows you to make nuanced changes to existing Traits and Audiences in situations where cloning or building from scratch may not suit your use case.
To edit a realtime Trait or Audience, follow these steps:
Engage then processes your realtime Audience or Trait edits. While the edit task runs, the audience remains locked and you can’t make further changes. Once Engage incorporates your changes, you’ll be able to access your updated Audience or Trait.
If your audience includes historical data (Historical Backfill is enabled), editing an audience creates a new backfill task. The backfill task, and therefore the edit task, take longer to process if the audience is connected to a destination with rate limits. Rate-limited destinations dictate how fast Engage can backfill. View a list ofrate-limited destinations.
It is not possible to edit an audience to convert it from real-time to batch, or vice-versa. If the computation type needs to be changed, you will need to recreate the audience with the appropriate conditions.
You can’t edit an audience to include anonymous users. If you need to include anonymous profiles, recreate the audience with the appropriate conditions
You can access your Audiences using the Profile API by querying the/traitsendpoint. For example, you can query forhigh_value_userproperty with the followingGETrequest:
The query would return the following payload:
You can read thefull Profile API docsto learn more.
You can download a copy of your Audience by visiting the Audiences overview page.
Once Segment generates the CSV, you can download the file directly. You’ll receive an email notification of the CSV completion, with a URL to the Audience overview page.
Note the following limits for the CSV downloader:
Generating a CSV can take a substantial amount of time for large audiences. After you generate the CSV file, leave the modal window open while Segment creates the file. (If the audience recalculates between when you click Generate and when you download the file, you might want to regenerate the file. The CSV is a snapshot from when you clicked Generate, and could be outdated.)
You can’t add account traits and identifiers using the CSV downloader with account level audiences. This is because every row listed in the CSV file is a user, and since account traits and identifiers only exist on accounts, they wouldn’t exist as a user’s custom trait and appear on the CSV.
The audience summary is a breakdown of the percentages of external_ids of users in the audience. These are the default IDs that Segment includes in the Identity resolution configuration. Segment displays the percentage of the audience with each identifier, which you can use to verify the audience size and profiles are correct. The update of identifier breakdowns on profiles doesn’t occur in real time.
The Identifier Breakdown won’t show custom IDs included in the Identity resolution configuration. Segment only displays external IDs in the breakdown.
Segment recommends using the$operator when you deal with array properties. However, the$causes logical conditions to apply independently to each array entry independently. As a result, you’ll get more accurate results by using theequals one ofcondition:

The audience builder accepts CSV and TSV lists.
This error occurs when creating audiences that reference each other, meaning audience X refers to audience Y in its trigger condition, and later you attempt to modify audience Y’s trigger condition to refer back to audience X. To avoid this error, ensure that the audiences do not reference each other in their conditions.
Including historical data lets you take past information into account. You can only exclude historical data for real-time audiences. For batch audiences, Segment includes historical data by default.

After creating your Linked Audience, you will be brought to the Overview page with the Linked Audience in a disabled state.
The linked audiences builder sources profile trait and event keys from the data warehouse. This data must be synced to the data warehouse throughProfiles Syncbefore you can reference it in the linked audience builder. If there is a profile trait that exists in the Segment Profile that hasn’t successfully synced to the data warehouse yet, it will be grayed out so that it can’t be selected.
The linked audience builder also returns a subset of available entity property key values, event property and context key values, and profile trait key values that you can select in the input field drop-down so that you don’t need to type in the exact value that you want to filter on. If you don’t see the value you’re looking for, you can manually enter it into the input field. 
Segment displays:
You can duplicate your conditions in the audience builder into the same condition group.You can only create nested entity conditions up to six levels in depth. For example, an entity condition that queries for relationships between Profiles, Accounts, Credit Cards, and Transactions has four levels of depth.
As you’re building your Linked Audience, you can choose from the following conditions:
The entity and event condition type supports these configurations: 
at least: supports 1 or greater,exactly: supports 0 or greater, 
at most: supports 0 or greater.
*When filtering by 0, you can’t filter on by entity properties or on additional nested entities.
You can create audience definitions using eitherANDorORoperators across all condition levels. You can switch between these operators when filtering on multiple entity or event properties, between conditions within a condition group, and between condition groups.
Example:

If you have defined entity conditions in your audience definition, you will see a “Matched Entities” tab in the audience preview to help you understand what entities qualified a user to be a part of an audience.
This information appears when you click the user profile generated from the audience preview. The contextual information encompasses entity relationships as well as entity column values that were used as filtering criteria in the audience definition. By default, Segment includes the entity ID. The data being returned is truncated - 10 entities at each level, 6 levels of depth. If you want to opt out of this functionality, contact Segment Support.

Event conditions
When filtering on event properties, you can dynamically reference the value of another profile trait, or enter a constant value. These operators support dynamic references: equals, not equals, less than, greater than, less than or equal, greater than or equal, contains, does not contain, starts with, ends with.
Entity conditions
When filtering on entity properties, you can dynamically reference the value of another entity column (from the same entity branch at the same level or above it), profile trait, or enter a constant value. You can only dynamically reference properties of the same data type. Dynamic references are supported for specific operators depending on the data type, as in the following table:
After you build your Linked Audience, you can send events to your chosen destinations and use them for personalizing your customer communications.
To activate your Linked Audience:
Destinationsare the business tools or apps that Segment forwards your data to. Adding a destination allows you to act on your data and learn more about your customers in real time. To fully take advantage of Linked Audiences, you must connect and configure at least one destination.
Linked Audiences destinations
Linked Audiences only supportsActions Destinations. List destinations aren’t supported.
Note:Ensure yourdestination has been enabledin Segment before you begin the steps below.
TheDestination Actionsframework allows you to see and control how Segment sends the event data it receives from your sources to actions-based destinations. Each Action in a destination lists the event data it requires and the event data that is optional. Segment displays available Actions based on the destination you’ve connected to your Linked Audience. You can see details of each option and how to use it in theActions Destinations Catalogdocumentation.
Select the Destination Action to call when the event happens, then clickNext.
Configure how and when events are produced with each audience run. Select the entities referenced in the audience builder to act as a trigger for your events.
After you select an action, Segment attempts to automatically configure the data fields that will be sent to the destination. You can review and adjust these settings before enabling this event.
Select additional traits and properties to include when the event is sent.
ClickCopy to use in Braze Cloud Mode (Actions)to copy the personalization syntax for the selected traits and properties to use in your destination messaging templates.
This feature is in beta for customers using Braze. Some functionality may change before it becomes generally available. This feature is governed by Segment’sFirst Access and Beta Preview Terms.
As you’re enriching your events in Linked Audiences, you should view a preview of the event payload schema based on the properties you select. It might look like the following:

Only required fields are displayed. All optional & pre-filled fields are hidden, though you can view hidden fields by clickingShow hidden fields.
These fields are pre-filled with properties configured by default.
Send a test event to ensure that everything is connected properly and your destination receives the event.
Enter the destination User id for the profile you want to use to test the event, then clickSend test event to destination.
The Event content drop-down shows you a preview of what the data sent to your destination might look like.
After building your Linked Audience, chooseSave and Enable. You’ll be redirected to the Audience Overview page, where you can view the audience you created. Segment automatically disables your audience so that it doesn’t start computing until you’re ready. A run is when Segment runs the audience conditions on your data warehouse and sends events downstream.
To enable your audience, select theEnabledtoggle, then selectEnable audience.
You can trigger a run for your audience if you want to send events to your destination without waiting for the next scheduled run. To do so, selectRun Now. This triggers a run for the audience and sends events downstream.
Use the Audience Overview page to view the audience profile count, current run schedule, run status, and upcoming run time.
Determine when an audience should run and send data to enabled destinations with a run schedule:
You can maintain your run schedule at any time from the audience’sSettingstab.
You can also clickRun Nowon the Audience Overview page at any time (even if the run schedule isIntervalOverviewDay and time) to manually trigger a run on your warehouse and send data to enabled destinations.
There may be up to a 5 minute delay from the configured start time for audiences that are configured with theIntervalandDay and timerun schedules. For example, if you configured an audience with theDay and timecompute schedule to run on Mondays at 8am, it can compute as late as Monday at 8:05am. This is to help us better manage our system load.
With your Linked Audience activated, follow these steps to monitor your activation:

Linked Audiences is an add-on to Twilio Engage. To useLinked Audiences, you must have access to Engage.
To provide consistent performance and reliability at scale, Segment enforces default use limits for Linked Audiences.
The Linked Audiences module provides you the flexibility to create and publish unlimited Linked Audiences within each billing cycle. This means you won’t encounter any limitations or pauses in service related to the number of Linked Audiences you generate.
Linked Audience limits are measured based on Activation Events, which is the number of times profiles are processed to each destination, including audience entered, audience exited, and entity change events. This includes both successful and failed attempts. For example, if you processed an audience of 50k to Braze and Google Ads Conversions, then your total Activation Event usage is 100k records.
Your plan includes a high limit of Activation Events, which ensures that the vast majority of users can use Linked Audiences freely without needing to worry about the limit.
To see how many Activation Events you’ve processed using Linked Audiences, navigate toSettings > Usage & billingand select theLinked Audiencestab. If your limit is reached before the end of your billing period, your syncs won’t automatically pause to avoid disruptions to your business. You may be billed for overages in cases of significant excess usage. If you consistently require a higher limit, contact your sales representative to upgrade your plan with a custom limit.
If you have a non-standard or high volume usage plan, you have unique Linked Audiences limits or custom pricing.

Account-level audiences are audiences for businesses that sell to other businesses. They return the set of accounts which match a combination of account-level traits, user-level traits, and user events. You can sync these accounts and associated users with downstream destinations.
You can use account-level audiences to accomplish the following use cases:
A single account-level audience can incorporate any combination of the following condition types:
To access account-level audience conditions:

The three types of user-level conditions are:
You can create conditions which operate on the set of events collectively triggered by all users associated with an account withaccount-level computed and SQL traits.
Workspaces with access to account-level audiences can create account-levelcomputedandSQLtraits. All user-level computed trait types are supported (see theTypes of computed traitsdocs for a full list). Account-level computed traits operate on the set of events triggered by all users associated with a given account.
Use-cases for account-level computed traits include:
Use SQL traits for complex calculations not supported by computed traits. For example, you would use SQL traits to calculate the number of unique users associated with an account who have logged in during the past month.
To associate users to an account with SQL traits, you must return both thegroup_idanduser_idin the account level SQL trait. This fires a Group call which Segment uses to add users to groups in destinations.
When a group (account) contains more than one user, the query returns duplicategroup_ids (mapped to uniqueuser_ids). However, Segment doesn’t return duplicategroup_ids in the account-level SQL trait. As a result, you can’t map users to accounts in a many-to-many situation.
Once created, you can connect account-level computed and SQL traits to downstream destinations. You can also use them as conditions in account-level audiences, enabling you to build audiences based on the set of events triggered by all users associated with a given account.
For example, you can create an audience which selects all accounts where users associated with the account have collectively logged in fewer than 10 times in the past 30 days. To accomplish this, you would:
Create an account-level event counter computed trait, selecting the “Logged In” event and specifying a time window of the past 30 days.
This computed trait will count all “Logged In” events collectively triggered by users associated with each account over the past 30 days, and append the resulting counts to each Account profile.
Create an account-level audience, containing a single condition using the new computed trait (for example,logins_past_30_days<10).
When you connect an account-level audience or trait to a destination, you select which events to send to the destination when the audience or trait is calculated. Each destination supports a subset of the following events:
Enable group calls when you want to update a destination’s account records based on audience membership. Enable identify calls when you want to update a destination’s user records based on audience membership.
Account-level audiences let you target all users associated with accounts that match your audience criteria. However, you may need to target a subset of users based on the traits of their associated accounts.
Account-level traits are not available in the user-level audience builder. However, account-level audience membership is available in user-level audiences through the “Part of an audience” condition. This enables you to use account-level audiences as a “passthrough” for account-level traits.
For example, you may wish to create an audience which selects all admin-level users associated with accounts in the software industry (for example,user.role=Admin AND account.industry=Software). To accomplish this, you would:
If you find that these limitations impede your ability to use account-level audiences, contactfriends@segment.comwith details about your use case.

With Generative Audiences, part of Segment’s CustomerAI, use generative AI to create Engage Audiences with natural language prompts.
Describe your desired audience based on events performed, profile traits, or existing audiences in your workspace. Based on your prompt, Segment builds the audience with generative AI.
For more details on AI usage and data, seeGenerative Audiences Nutrition Facts Label.
In this article, you’ll learn how to use Generative Audiences along with some best practices.
To create an audience with Generative Audiences:
To help you write your prompt, view theseexample promptsandbest practices.
To use Generative Audiences, a workspace owner must first accept the Customer AI Terms and Conditions.
Once Segment generates the audience conditions, the prompt box remains open for reference. You can close this box, or modify your audience description and clickBuild with AIagain.
Modifying an audience description overwrites the existing conditions previously generated. You can also edit any conditions straight from the audience builder.
Use the following examples to help you get started with audience prompts.
To build an audience with customers who haven’t made a purchase in the last 30 days, enter:Customers who haven't purchased in the last 30 days.
To find all profiles that have recently opened an email, enter:Profiles that recently opened an email.
To build an audience with customers who spend over $50 on an order, enter:Customers who have orders greater than $50.
You’ll have more accurate results if you base your audience prompts on specific events and traits that are in your Segment space.
Below are a few examples of how CustomerAI configures audience conditions for negative prompts. Negative conditions might include, for example, building an audience of users without a certain profile trait, or who haven’t performed certain events.
As you use Generative Audiences, keep the following best practices in mind:
As you’re writing your prompt, you can view traits and events that are active in your workspace from the audience builder. After you add a condition in the builder, click the property field to view active and inactive traits or events in your workspace.
You can also use the Profile explorer (Unify>Profile explorer) to view specific events and traits associated with profiles in your Segment space.
Learn more aboutusing existing events and traitsto build audiences.
Due to alimited space schema, CustomerAI may not recognize some events or traits that are inactive in your workspace.
Engage uses the following error messages with Generative Audiences:
Segment’s generative AI service is handled by a third party that needs context about your Engage workspace and has limitations to how many contextual parameters Segment can send it.
Segment solves this limitation by including only the most recently used properties and values for events and traits within your Engage space. As a result, some event and traits within your workspace may not be recognized.
At this time, Segment only supports audience description prompts in the English language. Support in other languages is currently unavailable and might provide undesired results.

With the help of sources and destinations in Segment’s catalog, you can create and send audiences and computed traits to third-party services.
Segment’s Connections pipeline first collects and sends events from your source to your destination. Built on top of Connections, Engage then uses the same source events to let you create audiences and computed traits within Segment. You can then send the audience or computed trait you’ve built to your destination(s).
Because Engage only sends audiences and computed traits to destinations, it doesn’t replace a standard event pipeline. Connect a source directly to a destination if you want the destination to receive all events that Segment gathers.
Once you’ve previewed your audience, you can choose to connect it to a destination or keep the audience in Segment and export it as a CSV file download.
When you create an audience, Segment starts syncing your audience to the destinations you selected. Audiences are either sent to destinations as a boolean user-property or a user-list, depending on what the destination supports. Read more aboutsupported destinationsin the Engage documentation.
For account-level audiences, you can send either aGroupcall and/orIdentifycall. Group calls send one event per account, whereas Identify calls send an Identify call for each user in the account. This means that even if a user hasn’t performed an event, Segment will still set the account-level computed trait on that user.
Because most marketing tools are still based at the user level, you’ll usually want to map this account-level trait onto each user within an account. SeeAccount-level Audiencesfor more information.
When you connect a new destination to an existing audience, Engage will backfill historical data for that audience to the new destination.
Follow these steps to connect an audience to a destination:
You can view a list of an audience’s connected destinations in the destination list table of the audience overview tab.

The Destinations table contains information about the destination’s matching mappings, status, and sync status.
Actions destinationshave mappings that can receive granular data from your audience. TheMatching mappingscolumn shows the number of mappings that match the data coming from the audience, as well as the number of enabled and disabled mappings. SeeWorking with mappingsfor more information.
The Matching mappings column will showNot applicablefor classic destinations.
TheDestination statuscolumn showsConnected,Disconnected, orDisabled:
TheSync statuscolumn shows the currentcompute statusbetween the audience and connected destination.
You can add and access mappings within your audience’s connected destination by following these steps:
Segment then returns you to the audience’s destination side panel, which shows your new mapping(s).
Use Segment’sDuplicate mappingsfeature to create an exact copy of an existing mapping. The copied mapping has the same configurations and enrichments as your original mapping.

Journeys, a feature of Engage, provides a way for marketers to personalize experiences through planning how and when to engage customers with the right campaigns and messages.
Journeys enable you to define steps in a user’s journey based on event behavior and traits. You can build Journeys from your tracking events, traits, computed traits, or audiences. At each step of a journey, you can send your list of users to any Engage-compatible destination.
Start with the visual builder to define entrance criteria, build out conditional branching logic, then focus messaging to drive conversion. Repeat purchase campaigns, trial conversions, and onboarding flows are great examples to get started from. For more information, seeBuild a Journey.
Connect destinations to your Journey to send events or user lists when users reach the corresponding step in the Journey. For more information, seeSend Journeys data to a Destination.
For information about best practices for getting started with Journeys, and to view frequently asked questions about Journeys, seeBest Practices and FAQ.

Verify that you’ve connected at least one source to your Engage space, with events streaming in.
For more information, seeSetting up your Sources.
Segment recommends that your entry condition’s time window be shorter than or equal to anyexit settingsyou have. This prevents users from repeating your journey an excessive amount of times.
If you select theUse historical dataoption, Segment queries all historical data to generate a list of users who enter the Journey upon publication. If you don’t selectUse historical data, only users who satisfy the entry conditionafteryou publish enter the Journey.
YourUse historical dataselection won’t impact subsequent Journey steps.  Only future events and existing trait memberships trigger post-entry Journey steps.
Once you’ve created an entry condition, you can begin adding steps to your Journey.
Journeys offers the following steps:
For more details on each available Journey step, view theJourney step types documentation.
Once you’ve added steps, you’re ready to publish the Journey.
To publish and activate a Journey, clickPublish Journeyfrom the Journey Overview. You can also clickPublish Journeyin the bottom-right corner of the Journey Builder.
Some Journey features can only be edited before publication. For more information, see the difference between Draft and Published Journeys below.
Your Journey is now live. Next, you’ll learn about making changes to a published Journey.
You may find that you need to make changes to a published Journey, like adding new steps or pausing entry to the Journey. This section explains how to pause, resume, and clone a Journey so that you can modify it as needed.
Pausing a published Journey prevents new users from joining your Journey. Users already in the Journey, however, will continue their progress.
Follow these steps to pause a Journey:
Compute Limits
Because pausing only affects new Journey members, paused Journeys still count towards compute credit limits.
You can resume new user entries to a paused Journey at any time.
After you resume a Journey, users who meet the Journey’s entry conditions will join the Journey. New users will not enter the Journey, however, if they met its entry conditions while it was paused.
Follow these steps to resume entry to a paused Journey:
You can duplicate a Journey by cloning it.
Follow these steps to clone a Journey:
Segment then creates a draft of your Journey.
You can also clone a Journey from a Journey’s Overview by clicking the…icon.
Use the Journey archive setting when you want to end a Journey but preserve its data.
No new users enter archived Journeys, and progress stops for any users already in the Journey. Archived Journeys no longersend data to Destinations.
Steps in archived Journeys don’t count towards your compute credits.
You can apply exit settings to both single entry and re-entry Journeys. Users who exit a Journey leave all Journey steps and Destinations.
Configure exit settings during initial Journey setup by enabling exit settings and entering the number of days that should pass before users exit the Journey. Journeys exits users once this time passes.
If you don’t apply exit settings to a Journey, users will remain in the Journey indefinitely.
The Journeys re-entry setting allows users to repeat Journeys they’ve already exited. Common use cases for Journeys re-entry include the following:
To let users re-enter a Journey they’ve exited, you’ll need to enable two Journeys settings:
Journeys exits users based off of the exit time you configure. Users can re-enter the Journey once they meet the Journey’s entry condition again and your defined re-entry time has passed. You can configure re-entry time by hour, day, or week. Re-entry time begins once a user exits the Journey.
Suppose, for example, you enable re-entry for an abandoned cart campaign. You set exit to seven days and re-entry to 30 days. A user who abandons their cart will progress through the journey and exit no later than seven days after entering. Once 30 days after exit have passed, the user will immediately re-enter the journey if the user still satisfies the journey’s entry condition.
Ad-based exit settings
Exit settings you configure for theShow an ad stepdon’t impact other Journey steps. Users can exit an ad step but remain in the Journey.
To enable Journey re-entry for a new Journey, follow these steps:
When you’ve finished creating your Journey, clickSave as Draftin the bottom-right corner.

On this page, you’ll find information about the steps you can add to a Journey.
Journeys has two steps that you can use to determine how and when users move to the following step.
TheAdd a conditionstep defines the conditions that a user must satisfy to move from one step to the next. You can define new conditions or import conditions from an existing audience.
TheAdd a delaystep defines the length of time in minutes, hours, days, or weeks that a user must wait before moving to the next step.
Journeys offers four steps that help you control how users flow through your Journey.
A true/false split divides the previous step’s user group into two branches, based on Boolean logic against a defined condition. Users who satisfy the condition(s) move to theTruebranch. Otherwise, they move to theFalsebranch. To enforce mutual exclusivity, Journeys evaluates true/false conditions when a user reaches the relevant step.
You can add Step Names to describe the users who end up in both the True and False branches.
Multi-branch splitdivides the group of users from a previous step into two or more branches based on each branch’s defined conditions.
Define the number of branches you want to create, then add anAdd a conditionstep to define each branch’s condition.
Journeys doesn’t enforce mutual exclusivity in branch conditions. For more information about ensuring branch exclusivity, seeBest Practices.
A randomized split lets you experiment with and test the performance of a Journey’s branches. When you create a randomized split, you add up to five Journey branches, each with a different step. Journeys then sends eligible users down one of the branches at random. Each branch receives a portion of the eligible users based on percentages that you assign to the branches.
If the Journey has a re-entry condition, users will join the same split branches upon re-entry.
To test your messaging channels, for example, you might create a randomized split with three different branches, assigning 40% of users to an email campaign, 40% to an SMS campaign, and 20% to a control group. Once users flow through the split, you can determine the success of the email and SMS campaigns compared to each other and the control group.
Follow these steps to add a randomized split to a Journey:
Users who meet the Journey’s entry condition will then enter the Journey and flow through the randomized split.
Once users complete your Journey’s randomized split step, you’ll have insight into how each split performed. You can take action on the results by cloning the Journey and sending a new set of users through the highest performing branch.
You can merge split Journey branches by using theConnect to existing stepsoption. Connecting to existing steps lets you apply a single step to more than one group. For example, you may want to target some Journey group members with email campaigns while targeting others with ad campaigns. Instead of duplicating steps, you can connect these steps to steps that already exist.
Keep the following in mind when connecting to existing steps:
Follow the instructions below to connect branches to an existing step:
With Journey actions steps, you can send marketing campaigns to groups of users and deliver Journey information to downstream tools.
TheShow an adstep lets you send users to an advertising destination. You can also configure exit settings that remove users from the ad step after specific periods of time.
For example, you may want to show an ad for only one week to users who abandoned a cart during a purchase. With the Show an ad step, you can remove users from the ad destination seven days after they enter it.
Ad-based exit settings
Ad step exit settings don’t impact other Journey steps. A user can exit an ad step but remain in the overall Journey. For more on Journeys exit settings, viewJourney exit and re-entry times.
Follow these steps to add a Show an ad step to a Journey:

With Journeys edits and versioning, you can make changes to live journeys.
Keep the following in mind when you edit a journey:
Follow these steps to edit a journey:
After you’ve published, users who meet the entry criteria can enter the new journey version.
You can return to the Journeys list page to view the new live journey and its previous versions, which are nested under the journey container.
Journey settings
A Journey’s settings can’t be edited once the Journey has been published, includingentry and exit settings. The only settings you can change after publishing a Journey are the Journey’s name and description.
Exit settings determine how users flow between journey versions.
Suppose you have a journey with exit settings enabled. The following table lists the actions you can take with the journey, as well as the results:
Suppose you have a journeywithoutenabled exit settings. If you pause or archive Version 1 when publishing Version 2 of that journey, then users can immediately enter Version 2 when they meet its entry criteria, even if they’re still in Version 1.
Version exclusion
To prevent users from a previous journey from ever entering a new journey version, enable version exclusion when you create the new journey version.
Adding a list destination to a journey version creates a new record in Segment’s systems. This process can take up to ten hours. During this time, you’ll be unable to publish new versions of a journey.
For example, if you add a list destination to Version 1 of a journey, and users begin flowing into the version, then Segment will begin creating the new record. If you create a Version 2 draft from Version 1 of the journey while Segment is still creating the new record, you won’t be able to publish Version 2 until this process is completed.
If the version has a list destination but no users have flowed into the version, though, Segment won’t create a new record for that list destination, and you won’t have to wait to publish a new journey version.

When you send data to destinations, you send a series of events or user lists, depending on the destination type.
Ensure you have connected and enabled destinations in your Space.
To include an advertising destination in a Journey, ensure you have connected and enabled the destination within your Space, then utilize theShow an Adstep.
With the Engage event tester, you can send a test event payload to a Destination. As a result, you can confirm that you’ve correctly configured Journey Audiences before you publish your Journey.
Follow these steps to send a test event:
If your Destination successfully handled the event, Segment displays a200 OKHTTP status code along with the full response. If an error occurred, Segment displays any available details in the Event lifecyle section.
Use Trait Enrichment and ID Sync to configure sync payloads that you send from Journeys to your destination.
To use Trait Activation with Journeys:
Use Segment’sDuplicate mappingsfeature to create an exact copy of an existing mapping. The copied mapping has the same configurations and enrichments as your original mapping.
The data type you send to a destination depends on whether the destination is an Event destination or a List destination.
To view the events that get generated by an Engage Space’s Journeys, navigate toUnify settings > Debuggerto view the list of sources that are configured to generate events foreach destination instance. Each source generates events only to its connected destinations. Under the source’s Debugger tab, you’ll find the most recent events generated by that source according the connected destinations’ audiences and computed traits.
The full JSON body of a journey event will have the journey’s specific details found under thecontext.personasobject. These fields can be useful when building outDestination Filters,Actions destination mappings, andFunctions.
The integrations object in these payloads will appear as{"All" : false,}and only list some destinations. This is due to the fact that each source has multiple destinations connected, while each journey may only have a subset of destinations connected to it. SeeFiltering with the Integrations Objectfor more information. The integrations object routing specific events to its specified destinations is also why a destination’sDelivery Overviewtab will show a large number of events under theFiltered at destinationbox, as that destination will only receive the events intended to be sent to it according to the journeys that are connected to that specific destination.
The format in which the destination receives updates depends on the call type.

When the user enters the step:
The destination receives a list of users who qualify for the associated journey step.

Segment maintains analytics for each Journey and its individual steps. As a result, you can view both granular and high-level performance metrics that give you insight into your Journeys.
Journeys Level Analytics is a collection of statistics that can help you assess how a Journey is performing.
Where individual messaging analytics give you focused insight into specific Journey events, Journey Level Analytics shows you a high-level overview of a Journey’s effectiveness.
Follow these steps to view the Analytics for a specific Journey:
Journeys in draft status don’t display Analytics.
The following table shows the statistics available for a Journey:
Completed and exits are mutually exclusive. The “Search for a user” search box excludes users who have exited the Journey.
Use the date picker to view a Journey’s analytics over a specific time frame in any 180 day period.
The following table shows descriptions of the time frames you can select:
Displayed with each step of your Journey, Step-Level Analytics shows you how many users made it to the step you’re viewing. You can use this data to gain context for how users flow through your Journey.
With Step-Level Analytics, you can configure two settings that give you granular insight into each step’s performance:
By default, Engage calculates an individual step’s analytics as a percentage of the number of users in the previous step. However, you can also view step analytics as a percentage of the initial number of users in the Journey’s entry step.
For example, suppose your Journey’s entry step contained 100 users, and 50 proceeded to the next step. For both calculation options, Engage would display50% and 50for the next step. If 25 users from the second step reached step three, however, Engage would display50% and 25for previous-step based calculations but25% and 25for entry-step based calculations.
To change this base percentage, selectCalculate % based on, then selectEntry steporPrevious step.
If you’ve enabled re-entry for your Journey, you can also configure Step-Level Analytics to calculate the step’s percentage based on unique or total users. SelectingUniquegenerates a percentage based on unique users, whileTotalincludes users who have re-entered the Journey.
For more information on re-entry settings in Journeys, viewJourney re-entry.

With Event-Triggered Journeys, you can build real-time, event-based marketing workflows to automate and personalize customer journeys.
Unlike traditional audience-based journeys that rely on pre-defined user segments, event-triggered journeys start automatically when users perform specific actions on your website or app.
On this page, you’ll learn how to create an event-triggered journey, configure entry conditions, and work with published event-triggered journeys.
Public Beta
Event-Triggered Journeys is in public beta, and Segment is actively working on this feature. Some functionality may change before it becomes generally available. Event-Triggered Journeys is not currently HIPAA eligible.
Event-triggered journeys help you create a responsive approach for time-sensitive use cases, like cart abandonment campaigns and transactional messages.
Whereaudience-based journeysactivate based on aggregated conditions, event-triggered journeys respond instantly to individual events, delivering personalized experiences based on the full context of each event.
Opt for an event-triggered journey in situations like these:
Before you begin
Before you start building an event-triggered journey, make sure that you’ve enabled alldestinationsyou plan to send data to and that the events you want to use as triggers are already available in your Segment workspace.
To set up an event-triggered journey:
When a journey instance reaches aSend to Destinationstep, you can configure how data is sent to your desired destination. This step allows you to define where the data goes, what actions are performed, and how information is mapped, giving you control over the integration. Event-Triggered Journeys currently supports allActions Destinations.
For other destinations or more complex logic, you can useDestination Functions.
Select a DestinationChoose the destination where you want to send data. Currently, onlyActions DestinationsandDestination Functionsare supported.
Choose an ActionSpecify the action to take within the selected destination. For example, you might update a user profile, trigger an email, or log an event.
Define the Event NameAdd a descriptive event name to send to your destination.
When a journey reaches this step, the Segment prepares and sends the payload based on your configuration. The integration ensures compatibility with the selected destination’s API, allowing seamless data transfer and execution of the specified action.
Event-Triggered Journeys includes advanced options to help you tailor journey behavior and customize data delivery to downstream destinations.
Unique identifiers in event-triggered journeys help you manage multiple journey instances when a user triggers the same event more than once.
When you selectRe-enter every time event occurswhen you create an event-triggered journey, you can choose an event property as a unique identifier. Selecting this option does two things:
For example, in an abandonment journey, suppose a user starts two applications (likeapplication_started), each with a differentapplication_id. By settingapplication_idas the unique identifier, Segment can match follow-up events (likeapplication_completed) to the correct application journey. As a result, each journey instance only receives the completion event for its specific application.
Follow the best practices in this table to optimize your event-triggered journeys:
Segment built Event-Triggered Journeys to respond instantly to events, offering real-time capabilities with a few considerations in mind.
Event-Triggered Journeys can power a variety of real-time, personalized experiences. This section details some common scenarios to help you see how they might work in practice.
Suppose you want to instantly send a personalized message whenever a user completes a specific action on your site, like filling out a form or subscribing to a service. With Event-Triggered Journeys, you can configure the journey to trigger each time this entry event occurs. Segment will forward the event data, including all relevant details, to your connected destination in real-time.
Imagine you’re running an e-commerce site and want to follow up with users who start the checkout process but don’t complete it within a certain timeframe. You can create an event-triggered Journey to watch for abandonment cases like these.
Start by setting thecheckout_startedevent as the trigger and specify a unique identifier likesession_idto track each user’s journey instance. Then, configure the journey to check for thepurchase_completedevent within a defined window (for example, 1 hour). If the user doesn’t complete the purchase, the journey can automatically send a nudge to encourage them to finish their order.
Say you want to follow up with users after they engage with specific content, like downloading an e-book or watching a demo video. Event-Triggered Journeys can help you send timely, personalized messages based on these interactions.
To do this, set the entry event tocontent_downloadedorvideo_watchedand configure the journey to send a follow-up email. You could even personalize the email with details from the triggering event, like the content title or timestamp, by configuring your destination payload to enrich the message with event-specific context.

Event-Triggered Journeysredefine how you orchestrate and personalize customer experiences.
This page explains Journey context, which can help you dynamically adapt each journey to individual user interactions, creating highly relevant, real-time workflows.
Public Beta
Event-Triggered Journeys is in public beta, and Segment is actively working on this feature. Some functionality may change before it becomes generally available. Event-Triggered Journeys is not currently HIPAA eligible.
Unlike traditional audience-based journeys, which rely solely on user progress through predefined steps, event-triggered journeys capture and store the details of user-triggered events. This shift allows you to access the data that caused users to reach a specific step and use it to make more precise decisions throughout the journey.
With journey context, you can:
For example:
Journey context is a flexible data structure that captures key details about the events and conditions that shape a customer’s journey. Journey context provides a point-in-time snapshot of event properties, making accurate and reliable data available throughout the journey.
Journey context stores event property information tied to specific user actions, likeAppointment IDorOrder ID.
Journey context doesn’t store:
However, the up-to-date values of profile traits and audience membership can be added in a payload sent to a destination.
This focused approach ensures journey decisions are always based on static, reliable data points.
Event properties are the foundation of Journey context. Examples of event properties include:
Segment captures each event’s properties as a point-in-time snapshot when the event occurs, ensuring that the data remains consistent for use in personalization.
Journey context provides the framework for capturing and referencing data about events and conditions within a journey. It allows Event-Triggered Journeys to dynamically respond to user behavior by making event-specific data available for decisions and actions at each step.
This is useful for scenarios like:
By incorporating event-specific data at each step, journey context helps workflows remain relevant and adaptable to user actions.
Journey context gets referenced and updated at various steps in an event-triggered journey. Each step plays a specific role in adapting the journey to user behavior or conditions.
This step checks whether a user performs a specific event within a given time window. If the event occurs, Segment adds its details to journey context for use in later steps.
For example, a journey may wait to see if acheckout_completedevent occurs within two hours of a user starting checkout. If the event happens, its properties are added to context and the workflow can proceed; otherwise, it may take an alternate path. The data captured includes event properties (likeOrder ID).
If a Hold Until branch is set to send profiles back to the beginning of the step when the event is performed, those events are also captured in context. Because they may or may not be performed during a journey, they will show as available in future steps but will not be guaranteed for every user’s progression through the journey.
The send to destination step allows journey context data to be included in payloads sent to external tools, like messaging platforms or analytics systems.
For example, a payload sent to a messaging platform might includeOrder IDandCart Contentsto personalize the message. Users can select which parts of journey context to include in the payload.
The structure of journey context organizes event-specific data gets and makes it accessible throughout the journey workflow. By standardizing how data is stored, Segment makes it easier to reference, use, and send this information at different stages of a journey.
Journey context is organized as a collection of key-value pairs, where each key represents a data point or category, and its value holds the associated data.
For example, when a user triggers an event likeAppointment Scheduled, Segment stores its properties (likeAppointment ID,Appointment Start Time) as key-value pairs. You can then reference these values in later journey steps or include them in external payloads.
The following example shows how journey context might look during a workflow. In this case, the user scheduled an appointment, and the workflow added related event data to the context:
This payload contains:
Journey context underpins the flexibility and precision of Event-Triggered Journeys. By capturing key details about events and decisions as they happen, journey context lets workflows respond dynamically to user actions and conditions.
Whether you’re orchestrating real-time abandonment recovery or personalizing messages with event-specific data, journey context provides the tools to make your workflows more relevant and effective.

When you create a multi-branch split, do not create overlapping conditions that might lead a user to qualify for more than one step at a time.
For example:
Add time windows when defining conditions to enforce funnel constraints in a Journey, rather than using an unbounded event condition which operates on the entire history of the user profile. For example, to check if a user has completed an order since receiving an email triggered 7 days ago, use the condition “Order Completed at least 1 time within 7 days.”
Unlike lists associated with Engage Audiences, users who are added to a journey list cannot be subsequently removed. Lists are typically associated with advertising campaigns, and you must take additional steps if you wish to ensure that users do not continue to be targeted with ads after they achieve some goal. A typical implementation pattern is:
Save your Journey in a draft state so that you can review before you publish it. Once you publish a Journey, you cannot edit select portions of a Journey and Journeys sends data to destinations.
Aside from the entry condition, all Journey step conditions are triggered by future events and existing trait memberships. Event-based conditions only evaluate events that occurafterthe Journey is published.
When youinclude historical datain a Journey’s entry condition, Unify identifies users who previously satisfied the entry condition and adds them to entry. For example, to evaluate if a user has ever used a discount code mid-Journey, create and configure aComputed Traitto select fordiscount_used = trueto use in your Journey.
Including historical data doesn’t impact any additional Journey steps, however. To include historical data in post-entry conditions, use the following table to identify which conditions will automatically include historical data:
To include historical data based on custom traits or events that predate the Journey, first build an Audience that includes the targeted data by following these steps:
For example, to includecustom trait = ABCin a Journey, create an Audience calledABCthat includes that custom trait, then add the Journey conditionPart of AudienceABC.
Using thePart of Audiencecondition, Journeys then populates the custom trait as if it were using historical data.
Follow these best practices to test your journeys:
Journeys run in real-time, like real-time Audiences in Engage. This means that users will progress through Journeys as Segment receives new events.
Yes. Users must first exit a Journey, however, before entering it again. To learn more about Journey re-entry, read theJourney re-entry sectionof theBuild a Journeypage.
Journeys supports all Engage destinations, including Destination Functions. Read more inSend data to destinations.
When building a Journey, if you checkUse historical data, you can see the estimated number of users in the initial cohort.
Once published, Journeys displays the number of users are in each step of the Journey at any given time.
The data type you send to a destination depends on whether the destination is an Event Destination or a List Destination.
For Engage customers, users with either the Engage User or Engage Admin roles can create, edit, and delete journeys. Users with the Engage Read-only role are restricted to view-only access.
Journeys triggers audience or trait-related events for each emailexternal_idon a profile. If a profile has two email addresses, you’ll see two Audience Entered and two Audience Exited events for each Journey step. Journeys sends both email addresses to downstream destinations.
It may take up to five minutes for a user profile to enter each step of a Journey, including the entry condition. For Journey steps that reference a batch audience or SQL trait, Journeys processes user profiles at the same rate as the audience or trait computation. Visit the Engage docs tolearn more about compute times.

Journeys are powered by a series of Audiences and Computed Traits. This guide defines the logic used to create sequential campaigns.
By the end of this guide, you’ll understand how and why users progress through your Journey. You’ll also gain familiarity with the following key Journeys concepts:
Journeys begin with an entry condition that computes like standardEngage Audiences. This entry condition queries your customer data in Segment to find users who meet your specified criteria.
After users meet the Journey’s entry condition, their progress through the Journey depends on satisfying the criteria of subsequent Journey steps.
Journey steps operate based on the following behaviors:
The combination of these traits, audiences, and business rules allows you to create an enforced funnel with the following implications:
To enter a Journey, users must satisfy the entry conditions.
To enter each subsequent step, three conditions must be true:
“Add a condition” steps operate likeEngage Audiences. The defined conditions provide criteria for each step’s membership.
When you add a “Wait” step to a Journey, Segment automatically includes wait times in the membership criteria of the next condition step.  Journeys represents wait times in relation to thepreceding_step_joined_time trait, which must be at least N time ago.
The following table summarizes the three step membership conditions and their equivalents in written logic:
For every step after the entry step, Journeys leveragesthe Engage real-time compute system.
When a user’s traits change or they exceed time-based conditions (for example, “within 7 days”), they may no longer fulfill the conditions of a previously joined step. If a user joins a step but no longer meets its conditions, Journeys removes them from that step’s preview and analytics.  The user does, however, continue to progress through the Journey.
Consider the following example of Journey conditions for a cart abandonment campaign:
If a user makes a purchase during the wait time of 5 days, the system would automatically update membership tofalsefor the audience created from the entry condition, Step 1. However, the user could still satisfy Step Condition 3 based on the three step membership conditions:
To maintain best practices and enforce your funnel, re-check or modify audience conditions that follow wait steps.  For example, adding apurchases = 0condition to Step 3 results in Segment not advancing users who made a purchase during the wait time:
Unless a Journey has an exit condition configured, Journey members permanently remain in Destination sync steps. Segment neither sendsAudience Exitevents to Destinations nor removes users from Destinations lists.
Exit conditions will lead to users being removed from all Journey steps and Destinations.
Each step’s membership conditions evaluate in real time, which means that users remain in a step until the immediate next step’s conditions becomes true.
Yes. To allow users to re-enter Journeys that they’ve exited,enable re-entryduring initial Journey setup.
Deleting a Journey removes its underlying audiences from profile views in the Profile explorer. However, the Journey’s True/False traits remain in the user’s last recorded state.
Note
Cloning a Journey generates new, unique traits and sync keys.  Deleting the original Journey won’t impact any cloned Journeys.
True/false splits enforce mutual exclusivity by ensuring that once users enter either side of a split, they can’t enter the other.
Multi-branch splits don’t enforce mutual exclusivity. Users can enter multiple branches of a split if they satisfy the split conditions.
Use Historical Data backfills the entry condition to “prime” the Journey.  Future events and existing trait memberships trigger all Journey conditions, except for entry.  As a result, event-based conditions only evaluate events that occurred after you published the Journey.
If you want to check for events that occurred before you published your Journey, base your conditions on computed traits instead.
For example, to evaluate if a user already in a Journey has ever used a discount code, create a Computed Trait fordiscount_used, and set it totrueorfalse.
With time windows within step conditions, you can designate a timeframe for Segment to evaluate whether or not a user has met the condition.  Segment calculates the time window from the current point in time, not relative to any other steps in your Journey.

Use Twilio Engage to build personalized email templates to store and use throughout marketing campaigns.
Build an email template from scratch using theDrag and Drop Editoror theHTML Editor. Includepersonalized contentin the subject line, preview text, and email body to engage with users based on their profile traits and actions.
Navigate toEngage > Contentand use the Email Templates page to preview and edit existing templates.
To configure an email template, clickCreate Template.
You must first connect aSendGrid subuser accountto your Segment space to build email templates in Engage. Visit theonboarding stepsfor more information.
Engage content validation
For all content editors in Engage, you’ll see alerts for any issues in your template, such as invalid profile traits or incorrect liquid syntax. Engage both flags template issue(s), and displays recommended next steps. While you can save these templates, you must fix any issues before using them in Engage campaigns.
You can send test emails before you include a template in marketing campaigns.
You can also test email templates directly from aSend an Email stepin Journeys.
Engage supports dynamic sending using merge tags. Personalize email content by adding real-time profile traits in merge tags to the following fields:
As you configure the template, clickMerge Tagsand select the profile traits to include. Engage inserts the merge tags based on cursor placement.
The following table contains a description and some best practices for all fields in the email template. Asterisks indicate required fields.
You can also add merge tags in the heading or body text as you design an email with theDrag and DroporHTMLeditors. Engage supportsliquid templatingto create dynamic content in the email design editor.
If you’re using theimage content modulein the Drag and Drop Editor, you can’t use liquid statements in theImage URLfield. 
To use liquid statements with an image, Segment recommends using anHTML blockwith the following syntax:<img src=“{{profile.traits.imageLink | default: '<insert your default URL here>'}}”, whereprofile.traits.imageLinkis an example profile trait representing personalized image links for each recipient.
To learn more about profile traits, visit Segment’sComputed TraitsandSQL Traitsdocumentation.
When you build an email template, you’ll need to include links that your customers can access to unsubscribe and manage their email preferences. You’ll find both in theSpecial Linksdropdown menu of theInsert/Edit linkwindow.
When you build email templates, it’s your responsibility to include an unsubscribe link in your message. Add unsubscribe links to an email template from the Drag and Drop or HTML editors.
When a recipient clicks on an unsubscribe link, they’ll see a confirmation page and the recipient’s subscription state is updated.
Learn more aboutUser Subscriptionsin Twilio Engage.
The manage preference link lets your customers opt in and out of email groups on an individual basis instead of unsubscribing from all your campaigns.
For more information, seesubscription groups.
Segment doesn’t support profile traits in object and array datatypes inBroadcasts, but you cam use them inJourneys.
View someemail deliverability tips and tricksfrom SendGrid.
You can also use the Templates screen in Engage tobuild SMS templates.
When you add a template to a Journey step, it becomes a copy specific to that step. Changes made to the original template won’t update the Journey version, and edits made in the Journey step won’t affect the original template. This keeps your Journey changes separate while preserving the original for reuse.

Use the HTML Editor to design your email template with both code and visual editing capabilities. Build your email template with code, copy and paste existing code, or use the Visual Editor for a code free design experience.
On this page, you’ll learn how to use the HTML Editor to build personalized email templates for your Engage campaigns.
You can navigate to the HTML Editor in two ways:
From theSelect Editorscreen, selectHTML Editorand clickBuild Email.
Use the Visual Editor for a no-code option to design your email. With the Visual Editor, you can:
Engage updates any changes you make in the Visual Editor to the HTML Editor in real-time.
To insert an image from the Visual Editor:
To preview your email template, click the preview icon in the Visual Editor toolbar.
From the preview screen, you can toggle between desktop or mobile to view the email in both displays.
Use the HTML Editor to maintain your email template with code. Copy and paste existing code or build a new template in the editor.
Engage displays any changes you make in a preview screen to the right of your code. You can preview your email in both desktop and mobile display.
ClickFormatat any time to properly indent and format your code in the HTML Editor.
When you toggle from the HTML Editor to the Visual Editor, Engage may make minor changes to your code formatting. If Engage re-formats your code, it will not affect the email layout.
Engage displays in-line error flags in the code editor to help you debug your code. If there are errors, you might not see content as expected in the preview screen until you’ve debugged your code.
For all content editors in Engage, you’ll see alerts for any issues in your template, such as invalid profile traits or incorrectliquid syntax. Engage both flags template issue(s), and displays recommended next steps. While you can save these templates, you must fix any issues before using them in Engage campaigns.
Add merge tags to personalize your message with user profile traits.
You can also add merge tags to your email right from the code editor.
Engage supports liquid templating to create dynamic content in the HTML Editor.
For example, use{% if %},{% elseif %}, and{% else %}tags to call a product by name if known, or use a default message:
If you use liquid templating, be sure totest your emailto make sure that everything renders properly.
While both the HTML and Visual Editor support liquid templating, Segment recommends using the HTML Editor to write liquid templating.
Engage doesn’t support liquid template syntax that produces partial blocks of HTML.
To view more examples related to your use case, visit theLiquidJS docs.
It’s always best practice to include an unsubscribe link in the emails you build. Engage adds an unsubscribe link to email templates, which you can edit at any time.
You can add unsubscribe links from the visual or HTML Editor.
From the Visual Editor:
To add a link from the code editor, use<a href = "[unsubscribe]"> </a>in your HTML.
For more on email unsubscribe links, view SendGrid’sbest practices.
From the editor screen, you can clickUse HTML EditororUse Visual Editorto toggle between the two editors.
The Visual Editor renders your HTML in an editable preview (similar to an email client), so you might need to accept formatting changes to your HTML to use the Visual Editor. In this case, Segment displays a confirmation modal with HTML differences.
Potential HTML changes include formatting, removing attributes with potentially unsuported scripts in your HTML (for example,onclickoronblur), attribute reordering, and adding missing tags.
If you don’t want to accept the changes required to use the Visual Editor, you can continue editing in the HTML Editor.
In the HTML Editor, you can use theFormatbutton to properly indent and format your code. Note that the Format button may not implement all changes necessary to use the Visual Editor.
After you design the email, clickCreate Email Template. You can navigate toEngage > Content > Templatesto view and maintain your email template.

With Twilio Engage, you can build personalized WhatsApp templates to store and use throughout marketing campaigns.
This page explains how to create, build, and submit WhatsApp templates for approval.
WhatsApp Template Approval
WhatsApp templates must be approved by Meta before you can use them in campaigns.
You can choose between three WhatsApp template types:
Before you begin
If you’re new to Engage Premier, you’ll need to sign up for theTwilio Content Editor betabefore you can use WhatsApp templates.
Follow these steps to build a WhatsApp template:
If you saved your template without submitting it for approval, it won’t be available for use in campaigns until you submit it for approval.
Follow these steps to submit saved templates for approval:
You can personalize your WhatsApp templates with merge tags based on profile traits.
To include merge tags in your template, click+ Add merge tagin the template builder and select the profile trait(s) you want to include in your message.
Segment displays the merge tag in the body as a numerical value surrounded by curly braces, like{{1}}. When a susbcriber triggers your WhatsApp campaign, Segment will replace the merge tag with the specific value associated with that subscriber’s profile.
If a merge tag doesn’t apply to a subscriber, Engage will use the content you enter into theDefault contentfield.

To learn more about profile traits, visit Segment’sComputed TraitsandSQL Traitsdocumentation.
Meta must first review and approve your WhatsApp template before you can use it in a campaign. Meta approves most templates in under an hour, but some approvals can take up to 48 hours. Keep this time frame in mind if you plan to send time-sensitive campaigns.
For more on the template approval process, viewrecommendations and best practices for creating WhatsApp Message Templates.
Once your template has been approved, you cancreate a Journey to send a WhatsApp campaign.

Use Twilio Engage to build mobile push templates to include throughout your marketing campaigns.
You can choose between two mobile push template types:
To build mobile push templates in Engage, firstconfigure Engage for mobile.
Follow these steps to build a mobile push template:
When you build a mobile push template, you can choose between three click behaviors, which determine what happens when a user taps on the mobile push:
Push tokens
Push tokens are unique identifiers Segment associates with each profile. For mobile push, you’ll need to configure identity resolution settings for the push tokensios.push_tokenandandroid.push_token. Using the Profile explorer, you can find a profile’s push tokens by opening a profile and then selecting the Identities tab. You can only send mobile pushes to profiles with push tokens enabled.
Follow these steps to test your mobile push:
Segment verifies that the profile you’re sending a test to has a push token, then sends the test. If the test mobile push doesn’t work as expected, confirm that the profile you’re sending to has a push token.
Badge counts appear in the corner of an app icon on your user’s device. Badge counts show the number of unread notifications. During push notification setup, you can set badge count behavior from the badge count dropdown.
Choose from these badge count settings:
Action buttons sit below a push notification and let your users take action on the push. You can use action buttons to encourage users to make a purchase, visit a website, or share content on social media, for example.
Follow these steps to add an action button:
You can add up to three action buttons for each push notification.
Personalize mobile push content in Engage using profile traits as merge tags in your messages.
To personalize a mobile push, clickAdd merge tagsin the template builder and select the profile traits to include in your message.

To add structure to your marketing content, you can organize templates into folders and duplicate them within your Segment space.
Use folders to organize your Email, SMS/MMS, Push, and WhatsApp content templates. Group related content together to better help you manage and find your marketing resources.
From the Templates overview page you can create, update, view, and delete template folders.
You must have both read and write workspace permissions to create or make changes to folders.
To create a folder:
You can also rename, add templates, or disband your folder from the Templates overview page. Disbanding a folder returns all templates from the folder to the main template list, without deleting any of the templates.
You can only organize templates in your folders according to template type. For example, you can’t group email and SMS templates in the same folder.
From the Templates overview page, you can select individual template(s) to move to your folders.
After you select the templates you’d like to move:
Use theActionsbutton in your folder to remove templates or move them to a different location. When you remove a template, Engage returns the template to the Templates overview page, without deleting it.
You can clone existing Engage templates to edit and use in your message campaigns.
To duplicate an email, SMS, or push template:

Twilio Marketing Campaigns

Airship BlogBloomreach BlogBraze BlogInsider BlogKlaviyo BlogTwilio Engage Foundations Documentation
With Twilio Engage, you can send email and SMS campaigns to users who have opted in to receive your marketing materials. On this page, you’ll learn how to create and send an email campaign.
Some knowledge of the Journeys product will benefit you as you read through this guide. If you’re new to Journeys, theJourneys documentationwill bring you up to speed.
Twilio Engage uses Journeys to send email and SMS campaigns.  With Journeys, you add conditions and steps that trigger actions like sending an email or an SMS.
You’ll build and then send your campaign in three stages:
Because Engage campaigns exist within Journeys, begin by creating a Journey:
With your Journey created, you’ll now create aconditionthat will trigger your email campaign:
With your entry condition added, you’re now ready to create your email.
Follow these steps to create an email campaign:
Some email campaign fields, likeSender emailandSubject, are required.  The Send Email window indicates required fields with an asterisk.  Refer to theemail campaign fieldstable for a full description of available email fields.
Editing Templates
If you use a template for your email, Engage creates an editable copy of the original.  Editing the template within the Journey won’t alter the original template.
As you create your email campaign, you can set an email to send to all users regardless of theirsubscription state. This may be useful, for example, when you need to send a marketing transactional email to a user who hasn’t subscribed to your marketing emails.
To send an email to all users:
When you bypass subscription states, be sure to follow local laws and comply withCAN-SPAM guidance.
For more, view SendGrid’semail deliverability best practices.
At this point, you can send a test email before publishing your campaign. Test emails confirm that your design, unsubscribe links, and merge tags appear as expected.
As part of the test send, you can enter custom values to populate the profile traits in your message.
Follow these steps to test your campaign:
With your email designed and tested, you’re now ready to save the campaign and publish your Journey, with the following steps:
Your email campaign is now live. When users trigger the email’s parent Journey condition, they will receive your email campaign.
The following table contains descriptions of all available fields in the Journeys Send Email builder. Asterisks indicate required fields.
When you create an email, you have the option to select an IP pool. An IP pool is a group of IP addresses available to you in SendGrid. You can create and view your IP pools in your Engage-linked SendGrid subuser account by navigating toSettings > IP Addresses > IP Pools.
Your sending reputation is based on a combination of your domain and the IP address you use to send emails. Emails that end up in your recipients’ spam folders could harm your sending reputation. As a result, you may want to keep your marketing and transactional emails on different IP addresses.
Keep the following in mind as you use IP pools:
For more information, seeSendGrid’s IP pools documentation.
Using Journeys, you can create multi-channel customer engagement with both email and SMS campaigns. Having published an email, learn howEngage SMS campaignscan help you market to customers through text messages.

Broadcasts are one-time email or SMS campaigns that you can send with Twilio Engage. Use broadcasts for single, one-off occasions like the following:
For more on the different types of Engage campaigns, readAudiences, Journeys, and Broadcasts.
On this page, you’ll find step by step instructions for how to create a broadcast, as well as information on broadcast best practices and analytics.
Follow these steps to create an email broadcast:
Segment recommends sending email broadcasts to users with asubscribedstatus. However, if you need to send an email broadcast to someone who hasn’t subscribed, you can configure an email tosend to all users.
Blind carbon copy
Broadcasts doesn’t support BCC (blind carbon copy). If your use case requires BCC,contact Segment.
Follow these steps to create an email broadcast:
Follow these steps to cancel a scheduled broadcast:
Unscheduled broadcasts revert to draft status and can be found under the Drafts tab of the Broadcasts page.
Keep the following information in mind as you work with broadcasts.
SMS broadcasts longer than 160 characters are split into segments and then joined together by the recipient’s device. As a result, you can send SMS broadcasts longer than 160 characters, but each 160-character segment is billed individually.
For more on message segments, viewSMS character limits.
The total size of your email, including attachments, must be less than 30MB.
To learn more, view SendGrid’semail limits.
The following table lists geographic availability, scale, and speed details for email and SMS broadcasts:
Long-code message throughput depends on a number of factors, including your10DLC trust score.
Segment recommends that you use short code phone numbers for SMS broadcasts sent to more than 5000 recipients.
Segment provides analytics for each broadcast. By selecting a sent broadcast from the broadcasts list, you can view both high-level performance metrics and granular insights on what actions individual recipients have taken on the Broadcast campaign.
Engage powers analytics for both email and SMS broadcasts. For more information on Engage analytics, viewAnalytics Overview.
To view information for a sent broadcast, navigate toEngage > Broadcasts, and select a broadcast from the broadcasts list.
The content tab shows the message content and email or SMS settings that you configured for the broadcast.
Segment maintains a recipients list for broadcasts. The recipients list lets you filter through several analytics statuses. Selecting an individual profile from the recipients list opens a preview pane with that profile’s details.
The settings tab shows your broadcast’s setup info, the recipient audience and its subscription status, as well as the broadcast’s scheduled time.
On the settings tab, you can also find the broadcast’s campaign key, which you can use to reference the broadcast. For example, you can use the campaign key to create an audience for future targeting or to create a suppression list of recipients you don’t want to receive future broadcasts.

This page walks you through the process of setting up mobile push notifications using Segment, Twilio, and Firebase/Apple Developer.
Prerequisites
Please reach out to your CSM or AE prior to trying out this feature.
This guide assumes familiarity with Swift and Kotlin and is intended for a developer audience.
You’ll set up mobile push in four stages:
Before you can send mobile pushes, you’ll need to set up analytics. In this step, you’ll integrate Segment’s mobile SDK into your app.
This section outlines the process for adding Segment’s base SDK to your app, including the Analytics Kotlin, Analytics-Swift, and React Native libraries.
You must initialize your Analytics instance in the Application class, otherwise you may experience issues with customization and delivery confirmation.
Follow these steps to integrate Analytics Kotlin:
For detailed instructions on integrating Analytics Kotlin, follow the steps in theAnalytics Kotlin getting started section.
Follow these steps to integrate Analytics-Swift for iOS & Apple:
For detailed instructions on integrating Analytics-Swift, follow the steps in theAnalytics-Swift getting started section.
Follow these steps to integrate the React Native library:
For detailed instructions on integrating Analytics for React Native, follow the steps in theAnalytics for React Native getting started section.
Next, you’ll add the Engage SDK plugins for both iOS and Android to your application.
Now that you’ve integrated Analytics-Swift, follow the steps in this section to add the Engage Plugin for iOS.
You can add the Engage SDK plugin using either Xcode orPackage.swift.
Instructions for adding the plugin with Xcode
In the Swift packages search dialog, enter the following URL:
Instructions for adding the plugin withPackage.swift
Import the plugin in the file where you configure your Analytics instance:
After your Analytics-Swift library setup, callanalytics.add(plugin: ...)to add an instance of the plugin to the Analytics timeline:
To start receiving and handling mobile push notifications, add or modify the following methods in yourAppDelegate:
The previous steps are required. For configuration options, including subscription statuses and media handling, visit thegetting started sectionof Segment’s Twilio Engage Plugin documentation on GitHub.
Now that you’ve integrated Analytics-Kotlin, follow these steps to add the Engage Plugin for Android:
Add the following to your Gradle dependencies:
Add the following service to theapplicationtag of yourAndroidManifest.xmlfile:
Add this plugin to your Analytics instance:
The previous steps are required. For configuration options, including subscription statuses and customized actions, visit thegetting started sectionof Segment’s Twilio Engage Destination documentation on GitHub.
Next, you’ll configure your iOS and Android push credentials for use with Twilio Notify and Twilio Notifications.
Before you begin, log into yourApple development accountand click onIdentifiersunder theCertificates, Identifiers & Profilessection. This will show a list of identifiers, including App IDs.
Next, you’ll create a push notification certificate, which lets your app receive notifications. You can either make a development certificate or a production certificate. This guide explains how to make a development certificate. Segment recommends that you use Xcode managed certificates.
Segment recommends that you use Xcode managed certificates for your application. If you prefer to create your certificate manually, follow these steps:
You just created an Apple Development iOS Push Services certificate, which you can now download and double-click to add to your Mac’s keychain.
You’ll extract your certificate key and private key from this file — you need these two keys to create a Twilio credential. First, run this command in Terminal:
cert.pemis your certificate key file. Next, run the following command in the terminal:
key.pemis your private key file. Next, run this command to process this key:
You can now paste your credentials into the modal found in the Twilio Console. Make sure that you strip anythingoutsideof the-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----and-----END CERTIFICATE-----boundaries and outside of the-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----and-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----boundaries before pasting your credentials. Check theSandboxbutton if you made a development certificate. Sandbox is synonymous with development mode.
Once you save a credential, theCERTIFICATEandPRIVATE KEYfields are hidden for security reasons.
After you’ve pasted your credentials, clickSave. You should see an SID appear on the new page; copy it to your clipboard, as you’ll need it in the next step.
Twilio lets you build multiple applications within a single account. To separate those applications, you need to create Service instances that hold all the data and configuration for a given application.
To do so, you’ll need to configure your Service instance to use the Credential that contains your APNS certificate and private key. You can do that using the Services page in the Console. You’ll need to update your Service with the Twilio Push Credential SID.
If you’re just getting started, set up the APN credential first, then create your Service by clicking the blue plus button on theServices Consolepage.
Follow the steps in Twilio’sConfiguring Android Push Notifications.
During Step 5,Upload your API Key to Twilio, follow these steps:
With your server key copied, finish steps 5 and 6 in the Twilio documentation.
Follow these steps to set up mobile push in Twilio Engage.
Follow the steps in 5a only if you’re new to Twilio Engage Premier. If you’ve alreadyconfigured messaging servicesas part of Twilio Engage Premier onboarding, you can skip to 5b.
Removing messaging services
To remove a messaging service, navigate to Engage > Engage settings > Channels and click the pencil icon underTwilio messaging service. Enter the account credentials by either using the API key secret or creating a new API key. Once you’ve selected the desired services, they will override the existing ones, effectively removing the ones you no longer need.
Complete mobile push onboarding by creating a new push service:
Now that you’ve completed mobile push setup, you’re ready tobuild a mobile push template.

Push tokens
Push tokens are unique identifiers Segment associates with each profile. For mobile push, you’ll need to configure identity resolution settings for the push tokensios.push_tokenandandroid.push_token. Using the Profile explorer, you can find a profile’s push tokens by opening a profile and then selecting the Identities tab. You can only send mobile pushes to profiles with push tokens enabled.
Follow these steps to test your mobile push:
Segment verifies that the profile you’re sending a test to has a push token, then sends the test. If the test mobile push doesn’t work as expected, confirm that the profile you’re sending to has a push token.

Use Trait Activation to configure sync payloads that you send from Engage Audiences and Journeys to a Destination or Destination Function. Map traits from user profiles to Destinations, configure identifiers to sync, and choose a sync strategy that fits your use cases.
Trait Activation includes bothTrait EnrichmentandID Sync. With Trait Enrichment, use custom, SQL, computed, and predictive traits to enrich the data you map to your destinations or destination functions. Use ID Sync to select identifiers and a sync strategy for each identifier when syncing Engage Audiences to Destinations.
To get started with Trait Activation, you’ll need to set up the destination that you’ll use withTrait EnrichmentandID Sync.
Select your destination, view its Segment documentation, then follow the corresponding required setup steps.
Segment recommends creating a new audience for Trait Enrichment and ID Sync. For existing audience destinations, both Trait Enrichment and ID Sync won’t resync the entire audience. Only new data flowing into Segment will adhere to new trait settings.
Contact Segment supportif you’d like your Audience resynced with Trait Enrichment and ID Sync.
For Audiences larger than 50 million users, it may take several hours, or even days, to sync. Only one resync is allowed at a time for each workspace.
Trait Enrichment and ID Sync can help you:
Increase advertising match rates: Expand the pool of users you advertise to and increase match rates by using traits and identifiers to find the right customers.
Include more personalized message content: Include traits in your payload for more up-to-date, accurate data.
Configure how you send identifiers to Destinations: Send the right identifiers to your destinations. For profiles with multiple identifiers, choose a strategy to select identifiers and send them downstream.

The setup steps you’ll use for Trait Enrichment depend on the type of destinationyou’ve connected.
To set up Trait Enrichment withAudiences:
You can set up Trait Enrichment with Journeys as you’re creating or editing your journey in thebuilder.
Default setup uses default Segment Destination settings without Trait Enrichment. To use the default settings, selectDefault Setup, then clickSaveto resume building your audience or journey.
You can customize event settings at any time.
With Customized setup, you can choose which traits you want to map to your destination or destination function.
Segment sends traits you select for enrichment in thetraitsobject in Identify calls (traits.trait_1,traits.trait_2), and as properties in thepropertiesobject in Track calls (properties.trait_1,properties.trait_2).
Here’s an example Identify call payload with traits in thetraitsobject:
And here’s an example Track call payload with properties in thepropertiesobject:
The following are a list of destination-specific requirements for using Trait Enrichment.
You can only sync the following traits to Facebook:
Each trait you select must map to a Facebook key.
emailis required when syncing to Google, because every payload will sendemail(as an identifier) downstream in addition to phone number.
Additionally, you can only map one trait per audience to Google as a phone number.
If you’re usingDestination ActionsorDestination Functions, use the following steps to set up Trait Enrichment.
After you add traits, configure how your selected traits will map to your destination.
Keep your Engage Audience open in a separate tab, as you’ll need to return.
For best results with Trait Enrichment, Segment recommends:
Trait Enrichmentlets you map the traits data you’ve collected with Engage to use when syncing audiences and Journeys to destinations.
ID Synclets you map the identities data gathered for a profile for use when syncing audiences and Journeys to destinations.
Trait Enrichment on existing audience destinations doesn’t automatically resync the entire audience. Only new data flowing into Segment will adhere to the new trait criteria.
Yes, you can edit mappings in the DestinationMappingstab at any time. However, changes will only take place in subsequent audience syncs or in new audiences connected to the destination.
No. Segment doesn’t guarantee match rate improvements with Trait Enrichment. Match rates depend on data quality.

Twilio Engage provides you with analytics that give you insight into the performance of youremail, SMS, and WhatsApp campaigns.
On this page, you’ll learn how Engage calculates campaign analytics and which messaging metrics you can view.
You’ll find a campaign’s analytics within its parent Journey, using the following instructions:
Understanding when and how Engage measures campaign analytics will help you as you review your analytics reports.
Engage begins tracking campaign performance after you send a campaign. As a result, a campaign’s analytics only reflect conversions that occurred after campaign publication. For example, suppose you send an email campaign promoting a sale in your online store. If a customer purchases a qualifying productbeforereceiving your campaign, their purchase would not count as a conversion.
Clicking on a campaign in a Journey opens a side panel that shows your campaign’s analytics. You can change both the date range and the base percentage type for any campaign.

The date range picker initially inherits the date range set in the campaign’s parent Journey, but you can use the campaign date range picker to define a range for the specific campaign you’re viewing. Changing a campaign’s date range won’t impact the parent Journey’s date range.
By default, Engage bases a campaign’s metrics on the number of sent messages. TheCalculate metrics usingdropdown lets you change this denominator value so that Engage bases analytics on the number of delivered messages. Changing the denominator won’t impact theConvertedmetric, though, since conversions are already based on delivered messages.
The following table lists the email campaign metrics that Engage tracks:
SendGrid powers Engage’s email campaign event analytics. For more details on email metrics, view SendGrid’sMarketing Campaigns Statistics Overview.
Machine opens occur when an email client automatically opens an email, giving the impression that a user opened your email even if they haven’t.
Segment tracks machine opens and subtracts them from the total number of opened emails. Segment displays this number in theTrue Openedtile, which gives a more reliable count of how many real users opened your campaign.
Hover over theTrue Openedtile for any campaign to see a full comparison of machine opens and true opens.

Engage provides a complete, up-to-date view of your users customer journey as it unfolds, and one of the best ways to understand the data produced by this journey is by analyzing the data in your data warehouse using SQL.
With Engage, you can send Computed Traits and Audiences to a data warehouse like Redshift, BigQuery, or Snowflake. This allows you to perform analysis and reporting around key customer audiences and campaigns, as well set up your user data as input into predictive models.
Segment makes it easy to load your customer profile data into a clean schema, so your analysts can help answer some of your toughest business questions.
When you build an audience or computed trait, you can configure it to send an identify call or a track call to your data warehouse, and additionally include mobile ids.

If you chose to send your Engage data as an identify call, Engage usually sends one call per user.
When you sendaudiencesas an identify call, Engage includes a boolean trait that matches the audience name. When a user enters an audience the boolean is set totrue, and when they exit, the boolean is set tofalse.
In the example below, you can see that theidentifypayload includes a trait of the audiencefirst_time_shopperwith the value oftrue.
When you sendcomputed traitsas an identify call, Engage sends a similar call with the computed value for that trait. In the example below, the traittotal_revenue_180_daysincludes the calculated value of450.00.
Engage identify calls appear in your warehouse using a similar format as normal Connections identify calls. Identify calls appear in two tables per Engage space. These tables are named with a prefix ofengage_, then the Engage space name, followed byidentifiesorusers. Theidentifiestable contains a record of every identify call, and theuserstable contains one record peruser_idwith the most recent value.
Theengage_schema name is specific to the Engage space and cannot be modified. Additional audiences and computed traits appear as additional columns in these tables.
engage_default.identifies
engage_default.users
When you sendaudiencesusing track calls, Engage sends anAudience Enteredevent when a user enters, and anAudience Exitedevent when the user exits, by default. These event names are configurable.
Engage also sends two event properties about the audience: theaudience_key, which records the name of the audience that the event modifies, and the audience name and its value, as a separate key and value pair. The value of the audience key is populated with a boolean value.
In the example below, you can see that theaudience_keyis set to record a modification to thefirst_time_shopperaudience, and thefirst_time_shoppervalue is set totrue.
When you sendcomputed traits, Engage sends aTrait Computedevent that records which computed trait it updates, then records the updated key and value. You can also customize this event name.

In the example below, the Trait Computed event contains thetrait_keywhich records which computed trait is being modified, and then includes the keytotal_revenue_180_dayswith the updated value of450.00.
Similar to track calls in Connections, Engage track calls appear in your warehouse as one table per event name. For example, if you configure your events calledAudience Entered,Audience Exited, andTrait Computed, Engage would create tables like the following examples in your warehouse:
engage_default.audience_entered
engage_default.audience_exited
engage_default.trait_computed
The users table is an aggregate view based on theuser_idfield. This means that anonymous profiles with just ananonymous_ididentifier aren’t included in this view. You can still view identify calls for anonymous audiences and computed traits in theidentifiestable.
The users table is synced as soon as the warehouse is connected as a destination in Engage, if you’ve previously created Engage computations. As a result, the table might contain data from computations not directly connected to the warehouse.
Although Engage can compute audiences and traits in real-time, these calculations are subject to the sync schedule allowed by your warehouses plan, which is usually hourly. You can check the warehouse sync history to see details about past and upcoming syncs. When you look at the sync schedule, sources with theengage_prefix sync data from Engage.
Yes. You can useWarehouses Selective Syncto manage which traits, audiences, and tables get synced from Engage.
Segment can only connect a source to one instance of each destination. For example, one source cannot send to two different Amplitude instances. As a workaround, Engage creates multiple sources to send events to the destinations connected to your space.
For example, if you have three webhook destinations in your space, Engage creates three different sources to send events to them. This creates three different warehouse schemas, and is usually the reason you have more schemas than spaces.
This approach doesn’t apply to messaging destinations, however. Messaging destinations connected from journeys and broadcasts don’t generate multiple background sources.

Paragraphs:
Engage Foundations requires a Business tier account and includes Unify.See theavailable plans, orcontact Support.

You can send your Computed Traits and Audiences to your Segment Destinations, which allows you to personalize messages across channels, optimize ad spend, and improve targeting. This page provides an overview of different ways to activate Engage data in Segment Destinations.
You can also use theProfile APIto activate Engage data programmatically.
There are two ways to send data to Engage Destinations: asEventsand asLists.
Event Destinationsreceive data one by one, on a streaming basis asevents, which are behaviors or traits tied to a user and a point in time. Every time a piece of data (such as a track event or identify call) is received in Segment — for example, from your website or your mobile app — Segment then sends this piece of data to the Destination right away.
List Destinationsperiodically receive data in batches, and these batches contain lists of users. In most cases, Segment sends data to a list destination every hour, and sends all data accumulated since the last batch was sent.
Some Destinations, such as Salesforce Marketing Cloud have both “event” and “list” destination types that you can use.
Engage sends computed traits and audiences to destinations in different ways depending on whether the destination is an Event or List type:
Computed Traitsare always sent to Event destinations either using an identify call for user traits, a group call for account-level computed traits, or a track event.
WithAudiences, Engage sends the audience either as a boolean (true or false)user propertyto Event Destinations, or as auser listto List Destinations. If you are a B2B company creating account audiences (where each account represents a group of users, like employees at a business) and sending them to list destinations, Engage sends the list of all users within an account that satisfies the audience criteria.
Event Destinations and Computed traitsComputed traits can only be sent to Event destinations.
When Engage sends a computed trait to an Event destination, it uses an identify call to send user traits, or a group call to send account-level computed traits.
Event Destinations and Audiences
Segment sends an identify or track call for every user in the audience when the audience is first created. Later syncs only send updates for those users who were added or removed from the audience since the last sync.
Most destinations require that you configure a column in your schema to receive the audience data, however, some destinations (like Braze and Iterable) allow you to send audiences without doing this. This depends on the individual destination, so consult the destination’s documentation for details.
List destinations can only receive Audiences, and cannot receive computed traits.
When syncing to a list destination Engage uploads lists of users directly to the destination. When you first create an audience, Segment uploads the entire list of audience users to the destination. Later syncs only upload the users that have been added or removed since the last sync.
User-list destinations can have individual limits on how often Segment can sync with them. For example, an AdWords audience is updated once every six hours or more, because that’s what AdWords recommends.
The payloads sent from your Engage space to your destinations will be different depending on if you configured the destination to receive identify or track calls, and whether the payload is coming from a computed trait or audience. As a reminder, identify calls usually update a trait on a user profile or table, whereas track calls send a point-in-time event that can be used as a campaign trigger or a detailed record of when a user’s audience membership or computed trait value was calculated.
To view the events generated by an Engage Space’s audience or computed traits, navigate toUnify settings > Debuggerand view the list of sources that are configured to generate events pereach destination instance. Each source will only generate events to connected destinations. From the source’s Debugger tab, you’ll find the most recent events generated by that source per the connected destinations’ audiences and computed traits.
In the full json body of an audience, computed trait, or journey, you’ll find specific details under thecontext.personasobject. These fields can be useful when building outDestination Filters,Actions destination mappings, andFunctions.
The integrations object in the payload displays as{"All" : false,}and only lists some destinations. This is due to the fact that each source has multiple destinations connected while each audience/trait may only have a subset of destinations connected to it. SeeFiltering with the Integrations Objectfor more information. The integrations object routing specific events to its specified destinations is also why a destination’sDelivery Overviewtab will show a large number of events under theFiltered at destinationbox, as that destination will only receive the events intended to be sent to it by audiences, traits, or journeys that are connected to that specific destination.
Identifyevents generated by a Computed Trait have the trait name set to the Computed Trait value:
Trackevents generated by a Computed Trait have a key for the trait name, and a key for the Computed Trait value. The default event name isTrait Computed, but you can change it.
Engage only sends events to the destination if the Computed Trait value has changed for the user. Engage doesn’t send a payload for every user in your trait every time the trait computes.
Identifyevents generated by an Audience have the Audience key set totrueorfalsebased on whether the user is entering or exiting the audience:
Trackevents generated by an Audience have a key for the Audience name, and for the Audience value:
The data type you send to a destination depends on whether the destination is an event destination or a list destination. For more information, read theJourneys documentationon how Journeys Identity and Track event payloads get formatted when sending to Event destinations.
Seethis docfor more information on Journeys events.Trackevents generated by a journey have a key for the journey name “audience_key”, and a key for the journey value:
Identifyevents generated by a Journey have the Journey key set totrueorfalsebased on whether the user is entering or exiting the Journey:
Engage has a flexible identity resolution layer that allows you to build user profiles based on multiple identifiers likeuser_id,email, ormobile advertisingId. However, different destinations may require different keys, so they can do their own matching and identification. For example, Zendesk requires that you include thenameproperty.
Engage includes logic to automatically enrich payloads going to these destinations with the required keys.
If you send events to a destination that requires specific enrichment Segment doesn’t already include, you can useID SyncorTrait Enrichmentto send additional data points to the destination.
Profiles with multiple identifiers (for example,user_idandemail) will trigger one API call per identifier when the audience or computed trait is first synced to a destination.
Email as an identifier is set intraits.emailfor Identify calls, andcontext.traits.emailfor Track calls.
You might also see that profiles that have multiple values for the sameexternal_idtype, for example a profile might have multiple email addresses. When this happens, Engage sends one event per email for each audience or computed trait event. This ensures that all downstream email-based profiles receive the complete audience or computed trait.
In some situations, this behavior might cause an unexpected volume of API calls. You can useID Syncto establish a strategy and control the number of events sent.
There are two situations when Engage sends an audience or computed trait to a destination.
The first is when the value of the trait or audience changes.
The second, less common case is that Engage re-syncs an audience or computed trait when a newexternal_idis added to a profile. For example, an ecommerce company has an anonymous visitor with a computed trait calledlast_viewed_category = 'Shoes'. That visitor then creates an account and an email address is added to that profile, even though the computed trait value hasn’t changed. When that email address is added to the profile, Engage re-syncs the computed trait that includes an email to downstream tools. This allows the ecommerce company to start personalizing the user’s experience from a more complete profile.
For more granular control that lets you specify which external IDs Segment sends to a destination, see theID Sync documentation.
Many Destinations have strict rate limits that prevent Segment (and other partners) from sending too much data to a Destination at one time. Engage caps the number of requests per second to certain Destinations to avoid triggering rate limits that would cause data to be dropped. The most common scenario when customers run into rate-limits is when Engage first tries to sync a large set of historical users. Once this initial sync is done, we rarely run into rate-limit issues.
For additional information on Destination-specific rate limits, check the documentation for that Destination. If you need a higher rate limit,let Segment knowwhich Destination you need it for and why.
When you create a new Computed Trait or Audience in Engage, you can choose to calculate it either using all the available historical data from your Segment implementation, or only using data that arrives after you set up the trait or audience. By default, Segment opts to include historical data. Afterwards, Segment only sends updates to that destination.
Why would I disable historical data?You might want to disable historical data if you’re sending a triggered campaign. For example, if you want to send an email confirming a purchase, youprobablydon’t want to email users who bought something months ago, but youdowant to target current users as they make purchases (and thus enter the audience).
The Facebook Custom Audiences Website destination does not accept historical data, and so only uses data from after the moment you configure it.
Use theEngage settingsto add a destination to your Engage space.
Connect any Cloud-mode destination that supports Identify or Track calls to Engage as an event type destination.

Yes. You can learn more about the Audience API by visiting theSegment Public API documentation.
Yes. Because Engage creates a trait with the same name as your audience, you can query the Profile API to determine if a user belongs to a particular audience. For example, to determine if the user with an email address ofbob@example.comis a member of yourhigh_value_usersaudience, you could query the following Profile API URL:
The following response indicates that Bob is a high-value user:
For more information on profile queries, visit theProfile API documentation.
You can’t change the audience key after it’s created. To change the key, you need to re-create the audience.
Avoid using the same audience key twice, even if you’ve deleted the key’s original audience. Downstream tools and destinations might have trouble distinguishing between different audiences that once shared the same key. This may create mismatch in audience size between Segment and the destination because the destination may count users of the old audience, resulting in a larger audience size.
Engage allows you to compute new traits and audiences of your users based on their entire customer journey, and all historical data you’ve tracked with Segment.
When you create a new computed trait or audience, you include a lookback window that determines how far back into the past the trait or audiences will be computed.

Some important things to keep in mind when setting a lookback window:
Historical lookback windows are based on the eventtimestampfield.
Lookback windows are precise down to the hour, so a 90-day lookback window will include any events with atimestamptimestamp within the last 2,160 hours (24 hr/day * 90 days).
The trait and audience will automatically update going forward as historical events exceed the lookback window.
Funnel Audiences allow you to usestrict, relative orderingfor your audience conditions. Common use cases for these audiences are Cart Abandonment (users that triggered the Product Added event but did not trigger the Order Completed event after the Product Added event occurred) and onboarding steps (users that Added Credit Card but did not Subscribe afterward).
To get started with Funnel Audiences, go to:
Audiences > New > Select Funnel Condition(“and then did not”/”and then did”)
The funnel condition will now be relative to the parent condition.
The audience in the image below includes all users that have Product Added in the last week, but not Order Completed within a day of doing so.

Funnel Audiences compute based on all instances of the parent event within the lookback period. This means that if you have a user that Product Added ⟶ Order Completed ⟶ Product Added, this user would be entered into the Abandoned Cart state despite having previously completed an order.
Engage’s merge protection algorithm protects your identity graph from unnecessary merges by finding and removing untrusted external IDs. Here’s an example:

In this example,anonymous_id: a1is not reset during aUser Logout. Without merge protection rules, Segment would mergeuser_id u1anduser_id u2. Instead, the identity resolution algorithm detects that such a merge would breakuser_iduniqueness and prevents the merge.
This is especially helpful for preventing “blob users” that are merged together by non-unique anonymous IDs or by common group emails liketeam@company.com.
Most destinations on the Segment Platform are built up around a user model. They assume that a user will have a single userId. Further, most Destinations are not built to handle anonymous traffic.
By default, Segment doesn’t sync the output of the Identity Graph to Destinations. However, Segment computed traits and audiences are based on the entire user profile, including anonymous and merged data. Segment syncs the value of these computations (for example,blog_posts_ready_30_days: 10) using alluserIdson the profile.
For Destinations that support analiascall (for example, Mixpanel), you can emit analiascall on merge.
The following list shows just some data sources you can sync to Engage:
Yes, Engage supports the ability to send an audience or computed trait to two or more accounts of the same partner. The most common use case is multiple Facebook, or Adwords ad accounts.
An audience/computed trait run or sync may fail on its first attempt, but Engage will retry up to five times before considering it a hard failure that displays on the audience/compute trait’s overview page. As long as the runs/syncs within the specific audience’s overview page indicate success, you can ignore any failure alerts.
How things work internally:Segment’s Engage scheduler fetches audiences/traits from the compute service and then handles the logic of generating tasks. These compute/sync tasks get scheduled and executed by another worker. These tasks are a list of steps to be executed. Each task has a series of steps that Segment marks as complete by saving a timestamp for the completion. If something disrupts the worker, it picks up at the latest step without acompleted_attimestamp. In some cases, the step or entire task might fail due to timeout or worker disruption. No matter the cause, Segment will retry any failures.
The audit trail’s configuration notifies about every task failure, even if the failure later succeeds. In most cases, you won’t need to track these failures, unless you notice actual computation or sync failures.
If you don’t want to receive notifications for temporary failures,reach out to support. Upon request, Segment can disable temporary failure notifications, which will reduce the number of notifications your workspace receives.
Each step of a Journey is an Engage audience under the hood. The conditions stack, so a user must be a member of the previous step (audience) and meet all conditions to be added to subsequent steps. However, if the user no longer meets entry conditions for a particular step, they’ll exit and you’ll see the user count reduced. For any subsequent steps a user is still a part of, they’ll remain until they no longer meet entry conditions.
Multiple audience events can trigger for a user if any of the following conditions occur:
1) There is a merge on the user.
2) Anexternal_idwas added to the profile.
3) The user hasmultiple identifiers of the same type. Segment sends one event per identifier for each audience or computed trait event.
4) Theinclude anonymous usersoption is selected for an audience. Segment sends an event for everyanonymousIdon the user profile.
Based on Engage behavior, standard source events such as Page, Track and Identify calls aren’t visible on the Engage source. The Engage source tracks and manages events related to audiences and computed traits within the Engage space. This includes events generated by changes in audience membership or computed trait calculations or when a user profile has been created in the Engage space. These are distinct from the typical Page calls, Track calls, or Identify calls (user interaction events) that you would observe in a standard Segment source.
Engage will not allow you to connect an audience/computed trait to a destination that is already linked to aConnections-based source. Instead, create a new instance of the destination with the correct Engage space selected as the data source.
The “5 most common values” are the most frequently observed values for a given trait across all users, not tied to any individual user.

Paragraphs:
Privacy Portal is available for the listed account plans only.See theavailable plans, orcontact Support.
On this page
When preparing for new privacy regulations (like HIPAA, the GDPR, or the CCPA), the
best practice is to create a comprehensive data inventory which includes details
about what personal information you collect, where you collect it from, where
you store the data, and who has access to it. The Privacy Portal helps automate
this process for the data you collect with Segment.
When you use Segment as the single point of collection for your customer data, you can use the Privacy Portal to:
Privacy Portal features are available to all Segment workspaces, however only workspace owners can access the Privacy Portal.
The Detection page in the Privacy Portal is where you can find out more about
exactly how data is being detected and classified in your workspace. You can
think of it as the brain behind the entire Privacy Portal, filled with the logic
that detects and classifies the data in the first place.
On this page, you can also modify your Detection settings andtell Segment how you want us to match data, so that it is meets your unique business needs.
Out of the box, the Privacy Portal contains matchers for the most common PII
fields. These matchers scan data coming from your Sources for PII based on both
exact-matching (looking for an exact match, such as a field name) and
fuzzy-matching (looking for both exact matches, and any values which are
similar).
In this section of Segment’s Privacy Portal, you can see the fields we match
against by default. The display lists whether we match on the key (for example
the label “CCN”) or value (for example, the payload 123-456-7890) in theMatches Oncolumn. You can also see how we classify these matchers by
default in theDefault Classificationcolumn.
Below is a full list of automatically detected restricted fields.
When Segment detects data that meets the criteria for one of the default
matchers (in the list above) in properties in your Web, Mobile, Server, or Cloud
Event Sources, we display it in thePrivacy Portal Inbox.
Default PII matchers are currently uneditable. If you want to change the behavior of a default matcher, you can create a custom PII matcher that replicates and overwrites the default matcher.
This is where you can create your very own matchers to tell Segment what to scan
for in your workspace. You can use this feature to detect properties that are
unique to your company or region, or that aren’t already handled by the default
matchers above. You can have up to 100 custom matchers per workspace. Custom
Matchers detect data in your Web, Mobile, Server, and Cloud Event Sources for 
fields undercontext,traitsandpropertiesobjects, and
the data they detect appears in the Inbox.
For example, if you have a restricted data point at your company called “SIN”
(for “social insurance number”) you can tell Segment’s Privacy Portal how to
treat that property whenever it is appears in data Segment processes.
To create a Custom Matcher:


Unless the field value pattern is unique, we recommend matching on the Key. For
example, for Credit Card Number, it’s better to detect on Keys that look like
“CCN” or “Credit Card Number” instead of trying to detect any values that look
like “1234567890”, because a 10-digit string can be found in all kinds of data
even when it’s not an CCN. For example, the key “Product_ID” could contain a
10-digit string, even though Product_ID does not actually contain an SSN. A
North American phone number (without country code) is also ten digits.
Use Access Roles to control who has access to the PII identified by your matchers.
Custom Matchers useregular expressions(using theGolang Regex Package) to provide you great flexibility for your matching patterns.
Regular expressions (or regexes) are a way to describe to a computer a pattern
that we’re looking for, using a series of special symbols. For example, if we
want to match all Gmail emails, we’d write the following regex:
This pattern matchesjane@example.com,mike@example.comand so on. Regular
expressions can also contain special symbols. One of them is\dand it tells
the computer to match a single-digit number. In that case, regular expressionNumber \dwould matchNumber 1,Number 2and so on. You can match multiple
digits by adding a plus sign (+) at the end:Year \d+. This pattern would
matchYear 2019,Year 2020, etc.
If you need to match a specific word, you can type the word without any
modifiers. For example, a regular expression ofApplewould only match strings
that containApple. You can also change it to match allAppleorOrangewords, by separating the search terms with a “pipe” character, like so:Apple|Orange.
Regular expressions have much more flexibility than we can describe here. Check
out the following resources to learn more about regular expressions so you can
build new custom matchers:
Segment’s exact matching and fuzzy matching do not detect all variations in the received keys
and for those scenarios, you can use synonyms.  For example, for the valuecredit card number, you can addcredit card no,debit card number,debit card no, or similar variations in the synonyms section to classify those fields.
The Inbox helps you keep track of new restricted data types as they are captured, quickly classify them, and build a data Inventory.
Segment detects these fields by scanning data from your Web, Mobile, Server, and Cloud Event Sources to detect PII based on thedefault PII matchers. New properties sent into Segment appear in the Inbox in realtime.
When you view the Inbox, it displays every property that was sent into Segment from Web, Mobile, Server, and Cloud Event Sources for the past 7 days. (Object Cloud SourcesandReverse ETL Sourcesdo not appear in the Inbox at this time.)
You can click a row in the Inbox to learn more about a field and where it was collected. The expanded view shows:

To streamline the classification process, Segment pre-classifies the data in the
Privacy Portal Inbox asRed(likely highly restricted data),Yellow(likely moderately restricted data), andGreen(likely least restricted
data). These colors indicate how restricted the data is for your business. You
can also send and block data from flowing based on its color classification and
how restricted it is.
Segment makes recommendations about how a field should be classified using
built-in PII matcherdetection, however, you can always
update the classification in the Inbox based on your company’s requirements.
You can update the classifications to suit your needs by clicking on the color
dropdown menu to change. For example, you might manually change a field that
does not contain personal information in your implementation from a “Yellow”
classification to “Green.”

When you’re satisfied that the fields have been classified appropriately, you
can clickAdd to Inventoryto officially apply the classification to the
field. This moves the field into yourData Inventory,
which is a central repository of all of the propertiesyouclassified as Red,
Yellow, and Green. Any time you send this field from a Web, Mobile, Server, or
Cloud Event Source — whether from another Source or event type — the Privacy
Portal automatically classifies it and adds it to the Inventory.
Red Classification:
Fields that are classified as ‘Red’ are masked for users that do not have PII Access enabled. These fields are also blocked if you have set Standard Controls under Privacy > Settings section.
Keep in mind that if you have set Standard Controls to block fields from any of your sources, any new classifications you create in the Inbox will start to take affect immediately. For example, if you have a Privacy Control set up to blockReddata from your Android source, any new fields you classify in the Inbox asRedwill be blocked from entering Segment from your Android source.
Yellow Classification:
Fields that are classified as ‘Yellow’ are masked for users that do not have PII Access enabled.
Green Classification:
Classifying a field as ‘Green’ does not have any impact on the behavior of masking of fields within the Segment App, it is only available for the housekeeping purposes.
Once a field has been classified as “Yellow” or “Red”, marking it “Green” will not make it visible for users that don’t have PII access.
The Inventory is a central repository of all of the propertiesyouclassified as Red, Yellow, and Green. Where theInboxshows new, unclassified data with Segment’srecommendedclassifications, the Inventory only contains data that you explicitly applied Classifications to.
The Inventory is intended to be a Single Source of Truth so you can answer common regulatory questions about the data you’re sending through Segment, for example:
Once you’ve classified the fields as Red, Yellow, and Green in the Inbox, the classified fields appear in the Inventory. You can use the filter at the top left to filter down to specific categories of data (for example, Red data, data from a production environment, data from specific sources).

Click into a field (for example,ip) in the Inventory to open the Inventory
details. The details sheet displays how many times a specific field has been
sent from each Source it comes from. You can click the Events tab to see which
events contained the event, along with the Sources which sent the event. The
data in the side sheet updates in realtime, and includes a limited historical
view.
You can clickConnected Destinationsto see which Destinations are
connected to the Source that contains the field. The Access tab displays a list
of who within your organization has access to this field.

Finally, workspace owners can use theDownload CSVbutton to export a CSV of
their data Inventory to share with their Data Protection Officer (DPO), Chief
Information Security Officer (CISO), legal teams, and more! Note that the CSV
download button includesalldata from your Inventory, and ignores any filters
you applied in the UI.

Paragraphs:

On this page
The Privacy Portal gives you control over whether specific data is allowed to
enter Segment.
The controls are available to all customers, across all plan types. With
these, you can block data at the source level, which means
data from those sources never enters Segment once blocked. This does not support blocking to device-mode destinations.
For example, if you want to prevent certain types of PII (like Credit Card
Number) from ever being ingested by Segment, you can block it using standard
controls by classifying those fields as “Red” in your Data Inventory,
and then blocking them in your standard controls settings. Blocking fields
blocks the properties from entering Segment, but does not block the rest of the
event data from flowing through. Remember that any data you classify as “Red” in your Data Inventory is
blocked if you enable these controls.
If you block Segment data at the source level using these controls, the data
does not enter Segment and we can not Replay it. Additionally, if you have
Privacy Controls configured to change how you route Red and
Yellow data into or out of Segment, the standard controls respect the rules set
by those Controls. For example, if you have a Privacy Control set up to blockReddata at the Source-level, any new fields you classify in the Data Inventory asRedare also blocked from that Source. Only fields added to the Data Inventory are blocked by a Privacy Control.
Alerts notify you when a new, unclassified data type appears in your Privacy
Portal inbox. You can set up Slack alerts or a generic Source to pipe alerts to
other tools you might prefer for events and notifications. We recommend setting
up alerts to help you ensure your Inventory is always up to date.

To set up a Slack Alert:
you’re all set!

On May 25, 2018 businesses faced the greatest regulatory change in data privacy policy since the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive was enacted: theEU General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR). The European Union began enforcing the GDPR on May 25, 2018 in an effort to strengthen the security and protection of personal data of EU residents.
In keeping with Segment’s ongoing commitment to privacy and security, Segment updated its practices to be GDPR compliant before the May 25, 2018, enforcement date. But that’s not all. As the central record for your customer data, Segment is also committed to making it easier for you to comply with the GDPR.
Specifically, here is how Segment supports its customers:
An updated Data Protection Addendum (DPA) to reflect the requirements of the GDPR and to ensure compliant data transfer with storage outside the EU. Existing customers can enter into the updated Data Protection Addendum usingthe opt-in process.
New product capabilities to help you be compliant when users request you delete or suppress their data.
Check out Segment’sGDPR blog postto learn about Segment’s plan for GDPR readiness.
The GDPR has different requirements depending on how your business interacts with personal data. Companies can be data controllers, data processors, or, in some cases, both a controller and a processor. Data controllers are businesses that collect their end users’ data and decide why and how that data is processed. On Segment’smarketing website, for example, Segment is considered adata controller. As a vendor, however, the more meaningful way Segment is impacted by the GDPR is as adata processor, as Segment is a company that helps its customers with the processing of their customer data.
In addition to damaging your customers’ trust, failure to comply with the GDPR can result in fines of €20 million or 4% of global annual turnover for the previous year (whichever is greater).
What are your responsibilities as a data controller?
If you collect data about EU residents and decide why and how those data are collected and processed, you may be considered adata controllerunder the GDPR. Data controllers are responsible for implementing adequate technical, organizational, and operational measures to ensure and demonstrate that all data collection and processing is performed in accordance with the GDPR, including entering into a relevant data processing agreement. Moreover, you must fulfill data subjects’ rights with respect to their data along the following principles:
Segment recommends reading the full text of theGDPRto better understand these rights and seeking independent legal advice regarding your obligations under the GDPR. You can also check out publications by data privacy associations such as theInternational Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP)for the latest news.
In addition to seeking independent legal advice regarding your obligations under the GDPR, here are some tips to get you started:
Educate yourself on the provisions of theGDPRto understand how they may differ from your existing data protection obligations and practices.
If you don’t have dedicated data privacy or security personnel in-house, consider appointing a directly responsible individual (DRI) or small team to manage your company’s GDPR compliance efforts.
Create an up-to-date inventory of personal data that you collect and manage. -
For data flowing through Segment, you can start with the Overview page in your workspace to understand where you are collecting (Sources) and routing (Destinations) customer data. Next, visit the Schema page within each of your Sources to understand the type of data you’re sending to Segment.
Be sure to consider the data that is not flowing through Segment. You’ll need to make sure the same bar for compliance is met across your organization.
Create a list of vendors who you send data to (analytics tools, CRMs, email tools, etc.), and understand whether they are a controller or a processor. Then, determine what their obligations are, and make sure they have a plan to be ready for the GDPR.
Develop a plan for obtaining and managingconsentin accordance with the GDPR or establish other lawful grounds for using personal data.
Determine if your company needs to appoint aData Protection Officer(DPO). If you will be appointing a DPO, begin searching for the best person for the role.
Becoming GDPR compliant takes time, and will require you to rethink how you collect and manage customer data. If you have any questions about the GDPR or want to learn how Segment can help you prepare,let us know!
Segment offers a Data Protection Addendum (DPA) and Standard Contractual (SCCs) as a means of meeting contractual requirements of applicable data privacy laws and regulations, such as GDPR, and to address international data transfers. Segment’s onlineData Protection Addendum(DPA) is already part of and incorporated into theTerms of Service. If you have a separate written agreement with Segment that does not include a Data Protection Addendum (DPA) or you would like to replace the existing Data Protection Addendum (DPA) that is attached to your separate written agreement with Segment’s latest Data Protection Addendum (DPA), please contact your account team orcustomer support.
Segment offers a Data Protection Addendum (DPA) and Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) as a means of meeting the regulatory contractual requirements of GDPR in its role as processor and also to address international data transfers.
Note on Schrems II: Despite the CJEU’s July 2020 ruling invalidating Privacy Shield as a means of validly transferring data to the USA from the EU, these developments are not expected to disrupt Segment’s ability to provide services to its EU customers as the European Court of Justice has reaffirmed that the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) remain valid as a method of transfer. Segment’s standard Data Protection Addendum includes a provision whereby should Privacy Shield ever be invalidated (as is the case now) then the SCCs will automatically apply.

Paragraphs:
On this page
In keeping with Segment’s commitment to GDPR and CCPA readiness, Segment offers the ability to delete and suppress data about end-users when they are identifiable by auserId, should they revoke or alter consent to data collection. For example, if an end-user invokes the Right to Object or Right to Erasure under the GDPR or CCPA, you can use these features to block ongoing data collection about that user and delete all historical data about them from Segment’s systems, connected S3 buckets and warehouses, and supported downstream partners.
Contact Supportif you need to process more than 110,000 users within a 30 day period.
Business Plan Customers
If you use this feature to delete data, you can not Replay the deleted data. For standard Replay requests, you must wait for any pending deletions to complete, and you cannot submit new deletion requests for the period of time that Segment replays data for you.
The legacy GraphQL APIs for user deletion and suppression are deprecated. Instead, use theSegment Public APIto interact with the User Deletion and Suppression system.
All deletion and suppression actions in Segment are asynchronous and categorized as Regulations. Regulations are requests to Segment to control your data flow. You can issue Regulations from:
You can programmatically interact with the User Deletion and Suppression system using thePublic API.
With Regulations, you can issue a single request to delete and suppress data about a user byuserId. Segment scopes Regulations to your workspace (which targets all sources within the workspace), to a specific source, or to a cloud source.
The following regulation types are available:
UsingSUPPRESS_WITH_DELETEorDELETE_ONLYregulation types might lead to additional charges levied by your destination providers.
SUPPRESSregulations add a user to your suppression list by theuserId. Segment blocks suppressed users across all sources; messages you send to Segment with a suppresseduserIdare blocked at the API. These messages do not appear in the debugger, are not saved in archives and systems, and are not sent to any downstream server-side destinations. However, if you set up a destination indevice-mode, the events are sent directly to destinations as well. In this case, Suppression doesn’t suppress the events.
When a customer exercises the right to erasure, they expect that you stop collecting data about them. Suppression regulations ensure that regardless of how you’re sending data to Segment, if a user opts out, Segment respects their wishes on an ongoing basis and across applications.
Suppression is not a substitute for gathering affirmative, unambiguous consent about data collection and its uses.
Segment offers suppression tools to help you manage the challenge of users opting-out across different channels and platforms. Segment encourages and expects that you design your systems and applications so you don’t collect or forward data to Segment until you have unambiguous, specific, informed consent or have established another lawful legal basis to do so.
To remove a user from the suppression list, create anUNSUPPRESSregulation.
When you create aSUPPRESS_WITH_DELETEregulation, the user is actively suppressed, and Segment begins permanently deleting all data associated with this user from your workspace. This includes scanning and removing all messages related to thatuserIdfrom all storage mediums that don’t automatically expire data within 30 days, including archives, databases, and intermediary stores.
Segment deletes messages with thisuserIdfrom connected raw data Destinations, including Redshift, BigQuery, Postgres, Snowflake, and Amazon S3. Warehouse deletions occur using a DML run against your cluster or instance, and Segment delete from S3 by “recopying” clean versions of any files in your bucket that included data about thatuserId.
Segment forwards these deletion requests to agrowing list of supported partners.
Note that Segment has a 30-day SLA for submitted deletion requests. Additionally, Segment’s deletion manager can only accommodate 110,000 users within a 30-day period and cannot guarantee a 30-day SLA if there are more than 110,000 deletion requests submitted within those 30 days. You can delete up to 5000userIds per call via Public API.Contact Supportif you need to process more than 110,000 users within a 30 day period.
Segment cannot guarantee that data is deleted from your Destinations.
Segment forwards deletion requests tosupported Destinations(such as Braze, Intercom, and Amplitude) but you should confirm that each partner fulfills the request.
You will also need to contact any unsupported Destinations separately to manage user data deletion.
Note that if you laterUNSUPPRESSa user, the deletion functionality does not clean up data sent after removing the user from the suppression list.
The Suppressed Users tab in Segment App (Settings > End User Privacy) allows you to create new Suppression requests and also shows an list ofuserIds which areactivelybeing suppressed. It can take a few hours/days for the suppression to become active, depending on the number of requests that are in the queue for your workspace. Once the request is active, Segment blocks data about these users across all sources.
Note that list only includesSUPPRESS_ONLYregulations. If you created a User Deletion request using UI, you will need to check theDeletion Requeststab, as those areSUPPRESS_WITH_DELETEregulation types.
To create a suppression regulation and add auserIdto this list, clickSuppress New User, and enter theuserIdin the field that appears. Then clickRequest Suppression.
Segment creates aSUPPRESSregulation, and adds theuserIdto your suppression list, mostly processed within 24 hours. In some cases, the suppression request can take up to 30 days to process. You can suppress up to 5000 userIds per call through the Public API.
To remove a user from the suppression list, click the ellipses (…) icon on theuserIdrow, and clickRemove.
This creates anUNSUPPRESSregulation, and removes theuserIdfrom your suppression list, mostly processed within 24 hours.
The deletion requests tab shows a log of all regulations with a deletion element along with status. The deletion requests can take up to 30 days to process.
In the Segment App (Settings > End User Privacy > Deletion Requests), you can click a userId to view its status in Segment internal systems, and in the connected destinations.
The deletion request can have one of the following statuses:
When checking the status of deletion requests using Segment’s API, the deletion will report an overall status of all of the deletion processes. As a result, Segment returns aFAILEDstatus because of a failure on an unsupported destination, even if the deletion from the Segment Internal Systems and supported destinations were completed successfully.
Refer toCreate Source Regulationin the Public API.
Refer to theCreate Cloud Source RegulationPublic API endpoint.
Cloud Sources sync objects to Segment. As a result, Cloud Sources are regulated based on anobjectIdinstead of auserId.
Before you delete the object from Segment, you should delete it from the upstream system first.
Refer toList Suppressionsmethod in the Public API.
Refer to theList Regulations from SourcePublic API method.
Segment stores a copy of all event data received in Segment’s secure event archives on S3. By default, all workspaces store data for an unlimited period of time, but you can modify the lifecycle policies for the data stored internally. Segment uses this data fordata replaysand for troubleshooting purposes.
Segment recommends keeping your data for at least 30 days to enablereplaysof your data.
To change your data retention settings, navigate toPrivacy > Settings > Data Retentionin Segment.
Select the default retention period for the workspace in this setting. This value applies to all sources in the workspace, unless overridden in theSource-Level Archive Retention Periodssetting.
You can select from the following Archive Retention time periods:

Paragraphs:
Consent Management is available to customers on Business tier plans.See theavailable plans, orcontact Support.
When an end user visits your web or mobile app, they setconsent preferences, or make decisions about the types of data they want you to collect, use, and share. These consent preferences are typically presented as a set list of categories that describe how your company intends to use that data. Some common categories include personalization, advertising, and site performance.
Segment integrates with your commercial third-party or bespoke consent management platform (CMP) that captures an end user’s consent preferences and enforces those preferences by only routing events to the categories consented to by an end user.

After a user sets their consent preferences on your web or mobile app, Segment requires you to add theconsent objectto all events. If you are using OneTrust, Segment provides a wrapper for your web and mobile libraries that can add the consent object to your events. If you are using another CMP, you are required to add the consent object to your events by either creating your own wrapper or using another mechanism. For more information, see theConfigure Consent Management documentation.
The events, stamped with the consent object, are then sent downstream to any destinations in categories that an end user consented to share data with.
Segment collects consent for both registered users and anonymous users.
For more information about consent in Segment Connections, see theConsent in Segment Connectionsdocumentation.

Segment Connections users can add theconsent objectto their sources to stamp events with the end user consent preferences captured by your consent management platform (CMP) and send them downstream to destinations in categories that an end user consented to share data with. Events without the consent object continue to flow to destinations without consent enforcement.
With theDestination Actions framework, you can send current end user consent preferences to flow to your destination alongside customer interactions so your destinations know when an end user revokes their consent.
For more information about sharing current end user consent preferences with your downstream destinations, see theSharing consent with Actions destinationsdocumentation.
For more information about configuring consent categories, see theConfigure Consent Managementdocumentation.
If your sources also contain the integrations object, Segment will look at the consent object first, and then take into account the integrations object according to the table in theReconcile consent object and integrations objectdocumentation.
Unify users must send an additional event to add consent preferences to Profiles
If you use Unify, see theConsent in Unifydocumentation for more information about the Segment Consent Preference Updated event, which Segment uses with the consent object to add consent preference to Profiles.
Segment requires every event from all of your sources to include the end user consent preferences, captured by your CMP or your application logic, in the form of theconsent object. The consent object is a JSON object nestled inside of thecontext objectwith the following format:
The JSON keys in the consent object should represent thecategoryIdfor each consent category.
Events without the consent object will continue to flow to destinations without consent enforcement.
Segment resolves conflicts between yourconsent object and your integration objectand between yourCMP and the consent categories you configured in the Segment app.
You can add both the integrations object and the consent object to your Segment payloads for greater control over how Segment routes data to your downstream destinations.
For more information about the Integrations object, please seeFiltering your Segment Data.
If an event includes both an integrations and consent object, Segment will look at the consent object first, and then take into account the integrations object according to the following table:
If you have a category configured in your consent management tool (for example,advertising) and there is no category with the same ID in Segment, the data will flow to unmapped destinations. If destinations are mapped to a different category in the Segment app, data flow will honor end user consent for that category.
If there is a category configured in Segment (functional) that is not mapped in your CMP, data will not flow to destinations mapped to thefunctionalcategory.
Events discarded due to consent preferences appear inDelivery Overviewat the “Filtered at destination” step with the discard reasonFiltered by end user consent.

Paragraphs:
Consent Management is available to customers on Business tier plans.See theavailable plans, orcontact Support.
On this page
After setting up your consent management platform (CMP), you can enforce the consent collected from your users by adding theconsent objectto your events.
Once you’ve configured consent in the Segment app and updated your sources to contain consent preference in every event, your events are routed only to the categories your end users consented to share data with. Events without the consent preference will continue to flow to destinations without consent enforcement.
Consent management edit and update capabilities limited to Workspace Owners
Only users with the Workspace Owner role are able to create, edit, and disable consent categories. All other users have read-only access to Consent Management features.
Before you can configure consent in Segment, take the following steps:
Limited availability of destinations
AWS S3 and Engage destinations do not enforce consent preferences.
Segment recommends mapping all destinations to a category
Segment assumes all destinations without a mapping do not require user consent and will receive all events containing a consent object. If a destination is mapped to multiple categories, a user must consent to all categories for data to flow to the destination.
Once you’ve created consent categories in the Segment app, you need to integrate your CMP with Segment.
Segment supports the following CMPs:
*If you send data to device-mode destinations connected to your Analytics.js source, you must navigate to your Analytics.js source in the Segment app, selectSettings > Analytics.js, and enable Destination Filters.
For more information about Segment’s Analytics.js OneTrust wrapper, see theAnalytics.js OneTrust Wrapperdocumentation.
If you’d like to integrate with any other CMP, Segment requires you to build your own wrapper or use any mechanism provided it meets the following requirements for data and event generation:
To get started building your own wrapper, follow the instructions in the@segment/analytics-consent-toolsrepository.
Consent Management is not backwards compatible with Segment's legacy iOS and Android libraries
If you are using one of Segment’s legacy mobile libraries (iOS or Android,) you will need to upgrade toSwiftorKotlinbefore using Consent Management.
Customers with Analytics.js 2.0 sources can use theSegment Inspectorto confirm that events from their source contain theconsent object. Unify and Engage users can also verify that theSegment Consent Preference Updated eventemits every time end users update their consent preferences.
All users can validate that events contain the consent object and that the Segment Consent Preference Updated event is present using Segment’sSource Debugger.
You can also confirm your events flow to destinations or are blocked from destinations according to the consent categories you created inStep 1: Create consent categories in the Segment App, if already connected to the destination.
If you need to make changes to your consent categories, you can edit them on the Consent Management page. You may experience some latency between making the changes and having the changes take effect.
TheAudit Trailsurfaces information about when a consent category is created, modified, or disabled, and when consent mappings are created or removed.
Disabling a consent category means that Segment no longer enforces end user consent preferences for the destinations in the disabled category. Other consent categories aren’t affected.

Consent in Unify and Twilio Engage is currently unavailable.
However, Segment’s OneTrust consent wrappers automatically generate the Segment Consent Preference Updated Track event, which will be required for future integrations with Unify and Twilio Engage.
Segment uses Profiles inUnifyas the source of truth of an end user’s consent preference when enforcing consent in Twilio Engage. To get consent preference on the Profile, Segment requires the use of theSegment Consent Preference Updated eventandIdentifyevents to route events to Unify. The Segment Consent Preference Updated and Identify events should include theconsent object.
Every time an end user provides or updates their consent preferences, Segment requires you to generate aSegment Consent Preference Updatedevent. If you are usingSegment’s OneTrust consent wrappers, Segment automatically generates a Segment Consent Preference Updated event. This event is required to add the end user’s consent preference on their Profile in Unify.
For example, if an end user agreed to share their information for functional and advertising purposes but not for analytics or data sharing, the Segment Consent Preference UpdatedTrack calldemonstrating their new consent preferences would have the following format:
If you use Protocols, the Segment app automatically adds the Segment Consent Preference Updated event to all your existing Tracking Plans and for every new Tracking Plan. Segment recommends you don’t edit or delete the default fields in the Segment Consent Preference Updated events, but you can add new fields as needed.
Segment Consent Preference Updated is a reserved event name
Segment has standardized a series of reserved event names that have special semantic meaning and maps these events to tools that support them.
See theSemantic Eventsdocs for more details.
In addition to enforcing consent in Connections, you may want these preferences to flow to each destination so your destinations can be aware when an end-user revokes their consent. You can use theDestination Actions frameworkto edit the destination’s mapping and copy the consent preferences from the Segment Consent Preference Updated event to a destination-specified consent field.
If you use Destination Actions to send consent information to your destinations, the Segment Consent Preference Updated event shouldonlyinclude information about a user’s consent preferences because this event is sent regardless of an end-user’s consent preferences.
Sharing consent with Classic Destinations is not available
Segment only supports sharing consent with Actions Destinations.

With Consent Management in Reverse ETL, you can enforce your end-users’ consent preferences that are captured by your consent management platform (CMP) and stored in your warehouse.
To enforce consent stored in your warehouse, build a Reverse ETL model that identifies consent categories. You can create a “consent to” column mapping in a new data model or update an existing data model to include a “consent to” mapping.
Consent in Reverse ETL supports Reverse ETL-supported Actions destinations and Segment Connections
At this time, Consent in Reverse ETL does not support adding consent to Segment Profiles using the Segment Profiles destination. To enforce consent data in your classic Segment destinations, use theSegment Connections destination.
Consent management edit and update capabilities limited to Workspace Owners
Only users with the Workspace Owner role are able to create, edit, and disable consent categories. All other users have read-only access to Consent Management features.
Before you can enforce consent stored in your warehouse, take the following steps:
Limited availability of destinations
Reverse ETL supports the Actions destinations in theReverse ETL catalogandSegment Connections.
Segment recommends mapping all Reverse ETL destinations to a category
Segment assumes all destinations without a mapping do not require user consent and will receive all events containing a consent object. If a destination is mapped to multiple categories, a user must consent to all categories for data to flow to the destination.
To edit or disable consent categories, view theConfigure Consent Managementdocumentation.
If you’ve already added aReverse ETL sourceto your workspace, you can proceed toStep 3: Identify consent columns.
If you haven’t already configured a Reverse ETL source in your workspace, follow the instructions in theReverse ETL: Add a sourcedocumentation to add your warehouse as a data source. When you’ve configured your Reverse ETL source, proceed toStep 3: Identify consent columns.
After you set up consent categories in the Segment app, you must identify the columns in your data warehouse that store end user consent by creating amodel, or SQL query that defines the set of data you want to synchronize to your Reverse ETL destinations. When building your data model, Segment recommends that you represent consent as a booleantrueorfalsevalue and map one consent category to one column.
Creating a data model that does not include information about consent preferences results in no consent enforcement
If you create consent categories in your workspace but fail to identify columns that contain consent preferences in your data model, events flow to all destinations in your workspace regardless of end user consent preferences.
To identify consent when building your model:
To update an existing Reverse ETL model to include consent enforcement:
You can select theSettingstab and clickConsent settingsto verify that the consent categories in your model match the consent categories you configured in your workspace.
You can store each consent category in its own column in your warehouse, or store your consent information in one single blob column. Segment requires your consent categories to be in their own column in your data model.
The following sample model maps consent categories from each column in your database:
The following sample model maps consent categories from one blob column in your database:
Failing to identify consent columns in your warehouse might lead to unintentional data loss
If you have destinations mapped to consent categories in the Segment app but fail to identify a column in your warehouse that stores consent for a category, then consent preference for that category will be considered to be false andno data will flow to destinations mapped to the category.
After you set up categories in the Segment app and create a SQL model that extracts consent information, connect your downstream destinations to complete the consent enforcement process.
Consent in Reverse ETL supports Reverse ETL-supported Actions destinations and Segment Connections
At this time, Consent in Reverse ETL does not support enforcing consent in the Segment Profiles destination. To enforce consent data in your classic Segment destinations, use theSegment Connections destination.
To add your first destination:
Segment does not count Reverse ETL records filtered by Consent Management toward your Reverse ETL limits
Records filtered out by Consent Management are not counted as part of your Reverse ETL limits. For more information about Reverse ETL limits, see theReverse ETL Limitsdocumentation.
You can validate that you successfully created your consent mapping in Segment Connections or supported Reverse ETL Actions destinations using the following methods.
Segment automatically adds theconsent objectto every event that’s routed downstream to your Segment Connections destination.Consent enforcement in Connectionsvalidates that only consenting data flows downstream to any classic Segment destinations connected to your Segment Connections instance.
Open the Source Debugger for your Reverse ETL source and confirm that theconsent objectappears on every event and that the consent object has the categories you mapped inStep 2: Identify consent columns.
Segment automatically filters out data from users who have not consented to the category mapped to your destination.
To verify that this behavior is working as intended, openDelivery Overviewfor a RETL-supported Actions destination and view the events that were successfully delivered to the destination. The events in your destination should only come from users that consented to send data to the category that your supported Actions destination belongs to.

No. Segment’s deprecatedopen-source Consent Manager, whichcapturesend user cookie consent, is not part of Segment’s Consent Management product, which focuses only onenforcingend user consent. Enforcing end user consent means sharing your end users’ data with only the destinations they consented to share data with and blocking the flow of their data to all other destinations.
Segment recommends moving from the deprecated, open-source Consent Manager to one that meets your legal compliance requirements.
All event streams destinations, with the exception of AWS S3 and Engage destinations, support consent enforcement.
You can use theDestination Actions frameworkto share the current status of your end-users’ consent with your Actions destinations.
For more information, see theSharing consent with Actions destinationsdocumentation.
Yes, you can use any commercially available CMP or custom solution to collect consent from your end users. If you use a CMP other than OneTrust, you must generate your own wrapper or other mechanism to add the following objects to the events collected from your sources:

Paragraphs:
On this page
Segment allows you to delete specific data relating to an individual end user, all data from associated with a source, all data related to a Unify space, or all data in your entire workspace.
To delete the data for an individual user from you workspace, follow the instructions on theUser Deletion and Suppressionpage.
To delete the data for an entire source, email the Customer Success team(friends@segment.com)to create a support ticket. In your email to Customer Success, include the following information:
*Due to the way Segment stores data internally, source-level deletions can only be scoped to one day in granularity. Deletion requests for smaller time frames are not supported.
Deleting source data
When Segment deletes your data for a particular source, the deletion is not forwarded to sources or data storage providers associated with your account: your data is only removed from Segment’s S3 archive buckets. To remove your data from external sources, reach out to the individual source about their deletion practices.
Workspace Owners can delete a Unify space and all of its associated data by sending an email to the Customer Success team(friends@segment.com)to create a support ticket. In your email to Customer Success, include the following information:
Segment waits for 5 calendar days after your request before starting a space deletion. If you want to cancel your Unify space deletion request, email the Customer Success team(friends@segment.com)during the first 5 calendar days after your initial request.
Data removed during a Unify space deletion
When you delete a Unify space, Segment removes all profiles, computed traits, audiences, journeys, and other settings related to the Unify space from internal Segment servers. Unify space deletion doesn’t delete data from connected Twilio Engage destinations. To remove your data from external destinations, reach out to the individual destination about their deletion practices.
Workspace admins can delete all of the data associated with a workspace, including customer data.
To delete all data from one workspace:
To delete data from all workspaces in which you have workspace admin permissions:
After you delete your workspace or account, Segment removes all data associated with each workspace within 30 days in a process called acomplete data purge. For a data purge status update, email the Customer Success team(friends@segment.com).
If you don’t delete your workspace after you stop using Segment,your data remains in Segment’s internal servers until you submit a written deletion request.
Purging data from workspaces deleted prior to March 31, 2022
If you deleted your workspace prior to March 31, 2022, and would like to have data associated with your workspace purged from Segment’s S3 archive buckets, email the Customer Success team(friends@segment.com)to create a support ticket. In your email to Customer Success, include either the slug or the ID of the workspace you’d like to have purged from internal Segment servers.
A complete data purge is the way Segment removes all workspace and customer data from internal servers across all product areas. To trigger a complete data purge, eitherdelete your workspaceor raise a support ticket with the Customer Success team by emailing(friends@segment.com). In your email to Customer Success, include either the slug or the ID of the workspace that you’d like to delete. Deletions related to data purges willnotbe forwarded to your connected third-party destinations or raw data destinations.
Segment waits for five calendar days before beginning a complete data purge to safeguard against malicious deletion requests. If you notice your workspace or account has been maliciously deleted, reach out tofriends@segment.comto cancel the data purge. After the five-day grace period, the deletion will be irreversible.

Segment is a HIPAA eligible platform, and meets the data privacy and security requirements of healthcare customers and their stakeholders. For more information about Segment becoming HIPAA eligible, see theannouncement blog post.
Twilio BAA are available to customers on a Business Tier plan.
Before you begin, check that the Segment products and services you’ll use for your HIPAA workflows are on the list of Twilio’sHIPAA Eligible Products and Services. After you’ve verified availability, contact your Account Expert torequest a demo.
Ensure your Workspace is eligible for HIPAA before you configure and send any personal health information (PHI).
With the BAA signed and Workspace confirmed as eligible, you can start building. For more information about starting a HIPAA compliant implementation, see Twilio’sArchitecting for HIPAA on Twilio, which outlines the shared responsibilities and requirements for building and maintaining HIPAA-compliant workflows in Segment.
Segment maintains audit logs of every read and update action a user performs in the Segment app that may involve PHI/PII.
Data captured in the HIPAA audit logs includes:
These logs can be provided upon request. For specific requests, please reach out tofriends@segment.com.
Segment encrypts the data in select fieldsmarked as yellow in the Privacy Portalbefore sending them to event stream, cloud mode destinations, further supporting HIPAA compliance in your destinations. Segment encrypts data using a RSAES OAEP SHA 256 algorithm.
Data encryption does not support “fuzzy matching”. You can encryptDefault PII matchers,Custom PII matchers, and anySynonymsyou’ve created for keys.
Data encryption only supports event-stream, cloud-mode destinations
Only data fields incontext,traits, andpropertyobjects can be encrypted.
After Segment encrypts the data, the encrypted data value is always astring. Any downstream validation that looks forintegerorbooleandata types will fail for encrypted values.
To configure data encryption while setting up a new destination:
Private Key is not recoverable
Segment does not save the private key created during the data encryption setup flow, and cannot retrieve the key after you finish setting up your destination. You can generate a new key using the instructions in theConfigure new key pairssection. Any data encrypted prior to generating a new key pair cannot be decrypted with the new key.
To configure data encryption for an existing destination:
Private Key is not recoverable
Segment does not save the private key created during the data encryption setup flow, and cannot retrieve the key after you finish setting up your destination. You can generate a new key using the instructions in theConfigure new key pairssection. Any data encrypted prior to generating a new key pair cannot be decrypted with the new key.
If you lose access to your private key, you can generate a new key pair in your destination’s Data Encryption tab. Any data previously encrypted using the previous key pair is unaffected, but cannot be decrypted using the new key.
To generate a new key pair:
After enabling encryption for a destination, you can add or remove encrypted data fields in your destination’sData Encryptiontab. All changes made to fields are forward-looking. You may experience some latency between making the changes and having the changes take effect.
To make changes to your selected fields:
Disabling the data encryption setting removes encryption on all previously configured data.
To remove encryption from incoming data:
Disabling the data encryption setting does not decrypt existing data, but does prevent any future data from being encrypted.
Segment automatically logs out all users with access to HIPAA eligible workspaces after 15 minutes of inactivity.

Paragraphs:
On this page
The Privacy Portal doesn’t doesn’t support fields from Cloud Object Sources like Salesforce or Zendesk.
Segment provides suggested classifications based ondefault PII matchers. These suggestions include exact and fuzzy matches for potential PII. You can update these classifications by following the instructions tochange a recommended classification.
Only Workspace Owners can access the portal.
All Segment plans include access to the Privacy Portal. Data privacy is a fundamental Segment feature, not an add-on.
When you block data at the source level using Privacy Controls, the data never enters Segment. As a result, Segment can’t replay the data. Segment recommends exercising caution when blocking data at the source level.
Segment classifications are recommendations. If a destination requires a field classified as Yellow, you can override the recommended classification to ensure the field gets sent downstream.
To locate a specificuserId, query your Segmentdata warehousefor theuserstable. Use other known details about the user, like their email address, to identify the correct row and retrieve theuserId.
You can send batches of up to 5,000userIds, or 4 MB, per payload. Segment processes these batches asynchronously.Contact Segmentif you need to process more than 110,000 users within a 30-day period.
In addition to your Raw Data destinations (Amazon S3 and data warehouses), Segment can forward requests to the following streaming destinations:
Segment forwards deletion requests but cannot guarantee that data is deleted from downstream destinations. You must contact these destinations to confirm that they executed the request.
To process deletion requests in Amplitude, add your Amplitude secret key to the destination settings under “Secret Key.” You can find this key in your Amplitude project’sGeneral Settings.
To send deletion requests to Google Analytics, authenticate your account with Segment using OAuth. Go to theUser Deletionsettings in your Segment Google Analytics destination and use your email and password to complete authentication.
Segment supports the following regulation types:
UsingSUPPRESS_WITH_DELETEorDELETE_ONLYregulation types might lead to additional charges levied by your destination providers.

Protocols isonlyavailable forevent stream(website, mobile, and server sources) andEngagesources.
Segment helps customers collect and integrate customer data across a wide range of tools and Destinations. To do so reliably, the data Segment receives must be clean, consistent and adhere to a well thought out tracking plan.
Protocols was built to automate and scale thedata quality best practicesdeveloped over years of helping customers implement Segment. Investing in data quality will improve trust in your data, reduce time spent by your engineering and business teams navigating and validating data, and ultimately allow your business to grow faster.
Protocols is a premium add-on feature available to Business Tier customers. If your plan includes Protocols, you can access itfrom theprotocolspath in your workspace. If your plan doesn’t include Protocols, contact your Segment account executive.
Good data quality starts with a well thought out Tracking Plan. With Protocols, you can define your events and corresponding properties in a Tracking Plan. This tracking plan becomes a central source of truth for product, engineering, analytics, and business teams.
With your tracking plan living in Segment, you can apply it to 1 or more data sources. Any event or property that does not match the tracking plan will generate a violation. Violations are displayed in aggregated form to spot trends, and detailed form to help you quickly find and resolve discrepancies.
To maintain a high degree of quality over time, we offer strict controls to block non-conforming events. Blocked events can be forwarded to a separate quarantined Segment source for analysis and review.
Even the most exacting data collection processes are subject to human error and organizational complexity. Transformations can be applied from within Protocols to change event and property names without touching code.

Figuring out what events to track in Segment can feel overwhelming. Fortunately, Segment has helped thousands of customers through this process and has amassed a ton of resources to help you get started. Whether you’re a small team just getting your app off the ground or a highly complex enterprise with hundreds of stakeholders, these resources can help.
That being said, be prepared to invest time defining how you want to track data. Any investment in improving data quality will reap massive rewards, and compound over time by allowing your analytics teams to produce better insights, your marketing teams to run better campaigns and so much more.
Tracking is about learning and taking action. Think about what you want to know about your product or customers. Think about what assumptions need to be tested or invalidated. Think about the unknowns. Here are some helpful questions to get started:
Segment recommends documenting your high-level business objectives. What measurable business outcomes do you want to achieve? Do you want to acquire new customers, activate new signups, drive incremental revenues among your current customer base? You can best answer this question by interviewing stakeholders who would consume the data in your organization.
With your business goals documented, you now need to map user actions to those business goals. For example, if one of your goals is to activate new signups, you want to think about which activities are related to a signup. Ask yourself what actions people take before signing up. Do specific actions predict user signups?
As an example, you may end up with a list like the following:
While these may only represent a portion of the total user actions you will track, focusing on business objectives helps make data collection more manageable.
With your business objectives documented, it’s time to build a set of standards that you and your team will use when determining what to track. Segment’s most successful customers limit their tracking plan to a minimal number of core events with rich properties that provide context. While some customers find success with the “less is more” philosophy of tracking data, others take a more liberal “track more and analyze later” approach. Both options have pros and cons you should take into account when you consider your company’s needs.
Regardless of your approach, keep the following tips in mind:
Pick a casing convention.Segment recommendsTitle Casefor event names andsnake_casefor property names. Make sure you pick a casing standard and enforce it across your events and properties.
Pick an event name structure.As you may have noticed from theSegment specs, Segment uses the Object (Blog Post) + Action (Read) framework for event names. Pick a convention and stick to it.
Don’t create event names dynamically.Avoid creating events that pull a dynamic value into the event name (likeUser Signed Up (11-01-2019)).
Don’t create events to track properties.Avoid adding values to event names that could be a property. Instead, add values a property (like"blog_post_title":"Best Tracking Plans Ever").
Don’t create property keys dynamically.Avoid creating property names like"feature_1":"true","feature_2":"false", as these are ambiguous and difficult to analyze.

Atracking planclarifies what events to track, where those events live in the code base, and why those events are necessary from a business perspective. Prior to Protocols, tracking plans typically lived in a spreadsheet. The tracking plan served as a project management tool to align an entire organization around data as the basis on which to make decisions. The tracking plan helps marketers, product managers, engineers, and analysts get on the same page.
The tracking plan has been so instrumental in helping organizations reclaim their own data efforts that Segment invested years of product development to createProtocols. Whatever tool you choose to build your tracking plan, make sure that it represents a single source of truth for your data collection efforts.
The Identify call is important because it updates all records of the user with a set of traits. But how do you choose which traits to include?
Here is a sample Identify call (withanalytics.js) for Segment:
The traits represent dimensions in your data that you can group or pivot on. For example, in the previous sample call, you can easily create cohorts of all types that areusersor accounts created within a time window of your choosing.
After you’ve documented yourevent naming and collection standards, it’s time to add events to your tracking plan. Segment recommends starting with fewer events that are directly tied to one of yourbusiness objectives. This focused effort helps avoid a situation where you become overwhelmed by endless possible actions to track. As you get more comfortable, you can add more events to your tracking plan that can answer peripheral questions.
Segment began by tracking these events:
Next, Segment added some of the following peripheral events that helped monitor performance:
For an ecommerce company, however, the main events might be something like:
Note that Segment has a set of “reserved” event names specifically for ecommerce, called the Segmentecommerce spec. Check it out to see which events Segments covers and how they are used in our downstream destinations.
For a community, on the other hand, an entirely different set of actions indicate engagement, listed in the following pyramid. For example, a community likeGrowthHackersmay want to track actions like:
With this, they’re able to measure key metrics around engagement and understand how users are moving towards their ultimate conversion event: curation content for others. For more information, check outthis articlefrom GrowthHackers about the events they track and why.
Each Track call can accept an optional dictionary ofproperties, which can contain any key-value pair you want. Thesepropertiesact as dimensions that allow your end tool to group, filter, and analyze the events. They give you additional detail on broader events.
As mentioned earlier, events should be generic and high level, whereas properties are specific and detailed. For example, at Segment,Business Tier Workspace Createdworks poorly as an event name. Instead, Segment usedWorkspace Createdwith apropertyofaccount_tierand value ofbusiness:
Similar to the traits in the Identify call, the properties provide you a column that you can pivot against or filter on in your analytics tools or allow you to create a cohort of users in email tools.
Avoid dynamically generatedkey’s in thepropertiesdictionary, as eachkeywill create a new column in your downstream tools. Dynamically generatedkey’s will clutter your tools with data that will make it difficult and confusing to use later.
Here is Segment’sLead CapturedTrack call:
The high level event isLead Capturedand all of the details are tucked into thepropertiesdictionary. In its downstream tools, Segment can easily look at how many leads were captured in different locations on the Segment website.
If you want to learn more about how properties are used by downstream tools, check outThe Anatomy of a Track Call.

Paragraphs:
On this page
A Tracking Plan is a data spec outlining the events and properties you intend to collect across your Segment Sources. Crafting a comprehensive Tracking Plan takes time and effort across a range of teams within your organization, and a deep understanding of your business objectives. Once created, the Tracking Plan becomes a highly valuable resource for both the engineers instrumenting Segment and all consumers of the data flowing through Segment. You canlearn more about data quality best practicesin the Protocols docs.
When building a Tracking Plan, it’s best to start with the key metrics that drive value for your business. Key metrics may include new user signups, top line revenue, product use and more. With key metrics defined, it becomes much easier to define which user actions help track or improve those key metrics. Each user action maps to a distinct event, or Track call, that you will track in Segment. The Tracking Plan can also validate Identify, Page and Group calls.
The Segment Tracking Plan feature allows you to validate your expected events against the live events that are delivered to Segment. Violations generate when an event doesn’t match the spec’d event in the Tracking Plan.
Segment can infer event data types, but is unable to do so if several data types are sent for a specific category.
Tracking Plans are stored in workspaces and can be connected to one or more Sources.
Segment Consent Preference Updated Event
After setting up a consent category, users of Consent Management see a Segment Consent Preference Updated Event added to all existing Tracking Plans.
To create a new Tracking Plan:
Consent Management users see the Segment Consent Preference Updated event on new Tracking Plans
If you are a Consent Management user and have created at least one consent category, Segment automatically adds theSegment Consent Preference Updated eventto all new Tracking Plans.
To create a copy of an existing Tracking Plan:
To download a Tracking Plan:
The columns in the Tracking Plan CSV file corresponds to the Tracking Plan UI options. For example:
Once you’ve downloaded a Tracking Plan, you canupload itas a template for a new Tracking Plan or use it to make changes to an existing Tracking Plan.
You can create a Tracking Plan or make changes to an existing Tracking Plan by uploading a CSV that contains the rules and events you’d like to track. Segment provides a Tracking Plan template file that you can download during the import process, or you candownload an existing Tracking Planto use as your template.
Tracking Plan CSV requirements
Tracking Plan CSV files uploaded to Segment must be smaller than 15 mb and contain one header row and one or more rows of data. Tracking Plans CSVs must also have fewer than 100,000 rows and 2,000 rules.
To create a new Tracking Plan by uploading a CSV file:
After uploading your CSV file, you are redirected to the Upload & Download History page while the upload is in progress. If the CSV upload fails, you’ll be able to either view the error directly in the Reports column on the Upload & Download History page or download theerror_report.csvfile that corresponds to the Tracking Plan you uploaded.
Tracking Plans created by an uploaded file are reflected in theAudit TrailandTracking Plan changelog. If you are a Consent Management user and have created at least one consent category, Segment automatically adds theSegment Consent Preference Updated eventto all new Tracking Plans.
Tracking Plans with imported libraries cannot be changed using the Upload a Tracking Plan method
If you have a Tracking Plan with imported libraries, you must make changes to your Tracking Plan in the Segment app.
To update a Tracking Plan by uploading a CSV file:
After uploading your CSV file, you are redirected to the Upload & Download History page while the upload is in progress. If the CSV upload fails, you’ll be able to either view the error directly in the Reports column on the Upload & Download History page or download theerror_report.csvfile that corresponds to the Tracking Plan you uploaded.
Any changes made to a Tracking Plan using an uploaded file are reflected in theAudit TrailandTracking Plan changelog.
Deleting a Tracking Plan requires Workspace Owner or Tracking Plan Admin permissions
You must have Workspace Owner or Tracking Plan Admin roles to delete a Tracking Plan. For more information about roles in Segment, see theRoles documentation.
To delete a Tracking Plan:
The Tracking Plan editor is organized as a spreadsheet to help you  add new events and properties, and edit the relevant fields for each. Like a spreadsheet, you can navigate across cells in a single event with your arrow keys and press enter to edit a cell.
The Status, Data Type, and Permitted Values columns appear as you add a Track call property.
To add a new Track call:
To add a Track call property:
Segment supports object and array data types in the Tracking Plan editor. These complex data structures have limited use cases and should be used sparingly as some destinations aren’t able to ingest the data structures. To add an object or array:
When creating array properties in your Tracking Plan, add theitemsnested property, denoted by the name of the array property with a.$suffix, to ensure that the nested property is marked as planned in the Source Schema.
You can define which traits you expect to see passed in Identify or Group calls like how you would add Track calls to the Tracking Plan. Navigate to theIdentifyorGrouptab in your Tracking Plan and click the(+)button to add a new trait.
It’s best to keep traits optional because Identify and Group are often called and pass onlynew or changedtraits, because Segment’s client-side libraries (analytics.js, Swift, Kotlin) cache traits in local storage. See theIdentify Best Practicesto learn more.
Removing a source from a Tracking Plan requires Workspace Owner or Tracking Plan Admin permissions
You must have Workspace Owner or Tracking Plan Admin roles to remove a source from a Tracking Plan. For more information about roles in Segment, see theRoles documentation.
To remove a source from your Tracking Plan:
You can applykey:valuelabels to each event to help organize your Tracking Plan. These labels are helpful when multiple teams are managing a single Tracking Plan, or if you want to specify a priority, platform, product, or similar meta-data for each event. You can filter by label from the Tracking Plan, Schema, Data Validation and Violations Summary views.
For consistency purposes, it’s best that you create a standard way of labeling events and share it with all parts of your organization that will use Segment.

Note:Tracking Plan Labels are only available for Track and Page events.
You can filter the Tracking Plan events by keyword or by label. The applied filter generates a permanent link so you can share specific events with teammates. Label filters also persist after you leave the Tracking Plan.
Protocols Tracking Plans useJSON Schemasto validate Segment event payloads. To support a broader range of validation use-cases, Segment lets you to edit your underlying JSON schema.
Editing a JSON schema requires technical expertise. TheJSON schema documentationandJSON schema validatorare helpful resources you can use.
You can edit the JSON schema for each Track event listed in the Tracking Plan, and a common JSON schema definition that applies across all events.
Each Track event in the Tracking Plan has a separate JSON schema definition to validate the properties in that event. To edit, click on the overflow menu next to each event row in the Tracking Plan.
Advanced edits to the JSON schema are not visible in the Tracking Plan and make it harder for other users to understand the validation logic. Be sure to communicate to any other Protocols users that you are making changes in the validation logic.
The Tracking Plan also uses a common JSON schema definition that applies to the entire payload of every event sent from sources connected to the Tracking Plan.
The common JSON schema definition is unique for each Tracking Plan. An example use of this feature is to validate that all Track, Identify and Page events sent to Segment include acontext.device.advertisingIdproperty. This validation ensures that every Segment call has a userId, anonymousId, and context object with a nested"device": { "advertisingId": "e23sfsdf"}object.
To edit the common JSON schema:
To edit the common JSON schema using the Public API, you’ll need to add your new JSON schema under the"global": object.
Negative lookahead regexes (?!)aren’t supported. This means you can’t use regex to prevent matches with a specific following character or expression. But, you can usenotin the regex of your JSON schema to generate violations when a property key or value doesn’t match the provided regex pattern.
Specifying data type
Property or trait data type should adhere to thedata types defined by JSON schema. Data type names must be lower-cased as specified in JSON schema. Date/time properties should be represented as astringtype withformatkeyword(for example: “format”: “date-time”).
Blocking data
JSON schema violation event blocking isonlysupported in cloud-mode Destinations. Seethe Customize your schema controls docsfor more information on blocking data.
Some customers prefer to manage the Tracking Plan with outside tools and resources. See theAPIs and extensionssection to learn more.
Segment offers Tracking Plan Event Versioning if you use Protocols to manage mobile sources, or to help you centrally manage a Tracking Plan for multiple teams. With Event Versioning, you can create multiple versions of an event definition, and validate events using a version key included in the Track event payload.
This can be helpful for mobile developers who might have several released versions of their app sending data at the same time. For example, a new mobile app release might add a new required property to an event likeOrder Completed. In this scenario, if you updated the Tracking Plan, allOrder Completedevents from your old mobile app versions would be invalid, because some customers won’t have updated to the latest version yet. Instead, with event versioning, you can allow validation of both the old and new versions of an event at the same time. When you’re ready to deprecate those old event versions, you can delete the version in your Tracking Plan.
For example, say you want to addsubtotalas a required property to yourOrder Completedevent. You would start by adding the required property to the event in the Tracking Plan as shown in the example below.

With event versioning, you can now create multiple versions of the event definition as shown in the example below. To create a new event version, click into the overflow menu for an event and selectAdd Event Version.

To ensure the Track events you send to a Segment source validate against the correct event version, you need to instrument your events to include acontext.protocols.event_versionkey and version value. The version value must pass as an integer, and should match the number shown in the Tracking Plan version tab. In the example below, the version number would be2.

Next, add the event version number to the context object. Foranalytics.jsTrack calls, you would instrument the event as in the example below. Note how the JSON objects forcontext,protocols, andevent_versionare nested.
Note:Protocols validate events against the oldest event version in the Tracking Plan for event payloads that are 1) missing the context.protocols.event_version key, or 2) contain an invalid/undefined event version (ex: event_version:3.2).

Tracking Plan Libraries make it easy to scale Tracking Plan creation within your workspace. You can create libraries for track events or track event properties. Editing Tracking Plan Libraries is identical toediting Tracking Plans.
Note: Segment does support advanced JSON schema implementations and identify/group trait libraries.
Once created, you can import event or property Libraries into a Tracking Plan using a simple wizard flow.
To create a new Library:

Tracking Plan Event Libraries support Track events and associated properties. Event Libraries are helpful when you want to track a group of events consistently across tracking plans. For example, if you are an eCommerce company with more than one application, you may need to trackeCommerce Specevents consistently across those sources. Instead of needing to re-create the eCommerce spec across all tracking plans, create a library and import the events to each Tracking Plan.
Tracking Plan property Libraries support Track event property groups. Property Libraries are helpful when you have more than one event in a Tracking Plan that share a common set of properties. For example, if you want to consistently includeorder_id,currency,cart_idand aproductsarray of objects in your checkout flow events, you can create a Library with these properties including descriptions, data types and conditional filters.
You can import event and property libraries into a Tracking Plan. Enter the Draft mode for a Tracking Plan and click theImport from Event or Property Librarydropdown. A wizard will appear allowing you to either add the events to a tracking plan, or add properties to selected events already in the tracking plan. After adding your events or properties, remember to merge your changes!

When you import events or properties from a Library, you can enable syncing to ensure that changes made to the Library pass down to all synced Tracking plans. Syncing is important when you want to make sure all Tracking Plans define events and properties consistently. For example, it’s best practice to create separate tracking plans for mobile and web sources as these two sources share some but not all events or properties. Library syncing is the best way to ensure that the shared events are consistently tracked across Tracking Plans, even as you make changes to the Library.
To enable syncing, select the desired Library from the Tracking Plan import flow, and toggle the syncing option. This selects all events or properties in the Library for import. Partial syncs are not supported.
Syncing a Library makes events and properties un-editable, and bypasses the Tracking Plan merge step. You can add properties to synced events, but cannot remove those synced events unless you also remove the Library sync. To unsync a library, clickView Synced Librariesfrom the Tracking Plan and click the overflow menu to unsync the Library.
All changes made to a synced library pass through to the Tracking Plans and may impact data deliverability

With your Tracking Plan complete, it’s time to apply the Tracking Plan to one or more Sources. SelectConnect Sourcefrom the right hand menu for your specific Tracking Plan.

From this menu, you will be redirected to a workflow to select a Source from your workspace. Note that a Source can only have one tracking plan applied to it. Youcan’tselect a Source that already has a Tracking Plan connected to it, but youcanapply a Tracking Plan to multiple sources.
After selecting a Source, you will be shown the consequences of connecting your Tracking Plan.
IMPORTANT: Make sure to read through the consequences of connecting a source!

To disconnect the Source from the Tracking Plan, go to the Tracking Plan overview page, locate the column for the tracking plan you want to disconnect, then click the icon under theConnected Sources. In the settings that appear, clickDisconnectnext to the Source you want to disconnect.

Get started with Segment
Crawling: https://segment.com/docs/protocols/enforce/schema-configuration/
Paragraphs:
Protocols is available as an add-on for Business plans only.See theavailable plans, orcontact Support.
On this page
The Schema Configuration settings for each source can be used to selectively block events, or omit properties and traits from.track(),.identify()and.group()calls. Segment can permanently drop events that are not included in your Tracking Plan, depending on the settings you select. Segment can also block events with invalid properties or invalid property values.
Blocked events not forwarded to a Source are discarded
Blocking is a serious step that you should only do after you have resolved any violations that appear when you first connect a Tracking Plan to a Source. Any blocked events that are notforwarded to a separate Sourceare permanently discarded and cannot be recovered.
To enable blocking, go to theSettingstab for your source and click onSchema Configuration. See below for detailed descriptions for each of the configuration settings.

You canexport your Source Schemaas a CSV file to quickly audit events from your Tracking Plan.
Archived events
If you archive events while your source is connected to a Tracking Plan, and then later disconnect your Tracking Plan from that source, any archived events will remain archived, but will be allowed if the Schema Configuration was previously set to block unplanned events when your Tracking Plan was connected to the source.
To view all archived events, go to yourSource Schemapage, clickFilternext to the search bar, and selectArchived. To unarchive events that have been archived, clickUnarchivein the event column.
When setting up Schema Configuration, note that Segment prioritizes blocking controls in the following order:
Standard Schema Controls: Segment first evaluates incoming events against these controls and your Tracking Plan. Events, properties, or traits not blocked or omitted in this phase then flow to the next level of controls: the Advanced Blocking Controls/Common JSON Schema.
Advanced Blocking Controls/Common JSON Schema:These controls act as a secondary layer, evaluating incoming events against the Common JSON schema included in your Tracking Plan.
Using only the Common JSON Schema to block events
If your Tracking Plan only has Common JSON Schema rules, you only need to use the Advanced Blocking Controls for your source.
If you use the Standard Schema Controls and omit properties or traits that do not exist, the Tracking Plan might not generate violations for the Common JSON Schema, as the entire Tracking Plan has nothing and everything is considered to be “unplanned”.
When you set this dropdown to Block Event, Segment drops any events that are not defined in your Tracking Plan. Only allowlistedtrackcalls in your Tracking Plan flow through Segment to your Destinations.
For example, if you include aSubscription Cancelledevent in your Tracking Plan, the example track call below would be blocked by Protocols because the event name does not match the event name casing in your Tracking Plan.
IMPORTANT: Unplanned event blocking is supported across all device-mode and cloud-mode Destinations.
Setting this dropdown to Omit Properties will ensure that properties not defined in your Tracking Plan are removed from the relevant event.
For example, if you include a singlesubscription_idproperty in theSubscription Cancelledevent in your tracking plan, the example track call below would have thesubscription_nameproperty omitted by Protocols.
IMPORTANT: Unplanned property omission is ONLY supported in cloud-mode Destinations. Unplanned properties will not be omitted when sending to device-mode Destinations.
JSON schema violation event blocking only supports cloud-mode destinations
Events with invalid properties are not blocked from device-mode destinations.
To block all Track calls that generate a common JSON schema violation:
Setting the dropdown toBlock Eventensures that all Track events with JSON schema violations (for example, missing required properties, incorrect property value data types, or invalid regex patterns) are blocked. A less aggressive option is to selectOmitfrom the dropdown which removes the offending property from the events.
This is an advanced feature that requires extensive testing and a squeaky clean data set/Tracking Plan to enable. To get a sense of which events will be blocked, or properties omitted, go to the Violations view for a source and note all events with a violation. For example, if you added asubscription_idrequired property to yourSubscription Cancelledevent in your Tracking Plan, the below track call would be either blocked by Protocols, or the property would be omitted, depending on your settings.
IMPORTANT: JSON schema violation event blocking is ONLY supported in cloud-mode Destinations. Events with invalid properties will not be blocked from sending to device-mode Destinations.
Setting this dropdown to Omit Traits will ensure that traits not defined in your Tracking Plan are removed from the identify call. For example, if you specify three traits in your Tracking Plan (name,email,join_date), the below identify call would have thefirst_nameproperty omitted by Protocols.
IMPORTANT: Unplanned identify trait blocking is ONLY supported in cloud-mode Destinations. Events with invalid traits will not be blocked from sending to device-mode Destinations.
JSON schema violation event blocking only supports cloud-mode destinations
Events with invalid properties are not blocked from device-mode destinations.

Paragraphs:
Protocols is available as an add-on for Business plans only.See theavailable plans, orcontact Support.
If you’re concerned about permanently discarding blocked events, you can enable blocked event forwarding on a Segment Source. To set up forwarding, navigate to the settings tab of the Source, then Schema Configuration.
Select the source you’ll forward events to from the Blocked Events and Traits dropdown. Segment recommends that you create a new Source for forwarded events to avoid contaminating production data and enable blocking only when you are confident about the quality of your data.
Since forwarding happens server to server, Segment recommends creating aHTTP Tracking API source, though any server-side source will work.

Only blocked events are forwarded to the source. Events with omitted traits are not forwarded. Instead, Segment inserts acontext.protocolsobject into the event payload which contains the omitted properties or traits.
Billing Note: Events forwarded to another Source count towards to your MTU counts. Blocking and discarding events does not contribute to your MTU counts.

With Transformations, you can change data as it flows through Segment to either correct bad data or customize data for a specific destination. Change event and property names to align events with your Tracking Plan, or to conform to a destination-specific requirement. For example, you can create a Transformation to change an event name fromcompleted_ordertoOrder Completedto conform toSegment’s ecommerce spec.
You can also useSegment’s Public APIto transform events, properties, and property values for manyuse cases.
Transformations are very powerful and should be applied with care.
Transformationsirrevocablychange the event payloads flowing through Segment and immediately affect either all destinations, or a single downstream destination, depending on your settings.
As soon as you apply a Transformation, the original tracking payloads are not easily recoverable.
Segment’s goal is to make Transformations a powerful tool that complements a well structured Tracking Plan. Together, these features help your organization scale and achieve high data quality. For that reason Segment recommends that you start your data quality strategy with a clearly defined Tracking Plan. Without this critical component, the risk of creating conflicting or detrimental transformations increases.
All Protocols Transformations are listed in the Transformations tab in the Protocols section. The list view supports filtering and sorting to organize transformations by transformation type, source, and destination.

Transformations can be enabled and disabled directly from the list view using the toggle.
Transformations can be deleted and edited by clicking on the overflow menu. When editing a Transformation, only the resulting event or property names, and Transformation name can be edited. If you want to select a different event or source, create a separate Transformation rule.
Transformations created using the Public API
On the Transformations page in the Segment app, you can view and rename transformations that you created with the Public API. In some cases, you can edit these transformations in the UI.
To create a Transformation, navigate to the Transformations tab in Protocols and clickNew Transformationin the top right. A three-step wizard guides you through creating a transformation.
Workspace Owner or Source Admin permissions are required to create and edit transformations.
Source Read-only permissions are required to view transformations.

To create a Transformation, you first need to select which type of transformation you want to create. For each transformation type, Segment displays a description, use cases, and example payload. Current transformation types available in your Segment workspace include:
Rename track event:Rename track event name at the source or per destination. The events listed in the event names dropdown menu correspond to the events listed on thesource schema view.
Edit track event properties:Rename multiple properties and/or change property data structure at the source or per destination
Edit identify or group event traits:Rename multiple traits and/or change trait data structure at the source or per destination
View moreuse casesof Transformations available in both your workspace andSegment’s Public API.
Depending on the transformation type you selected, relevant drop-down selectors and fields are presented to define how you want to transform the data.
Multiple transformations cannot be created for the same source + type + event + destination combo. This restriction blocks circular transformations (for example,order_updatedtoorderUpdatedtoorder_updated), minimizes unexpected transformations, and enables easy filtering across each dimension.
Regardless of the type of transformation selected, first select a source. Each Transformation can only apply to a single source. While this makes it more difficult to apply transformations broadly, it ensures you are only transforming data relevant to the selected source.
After selecting the source, you will need to select a scope. Scope determines where Segment applies the transformation.
Source-scoped Transformations only apply to cloud-mode, S3, and data warehouse destinations.

Source scope:Events are transformed in allactive Segment cloud-mode destinations, warehouses, and S3 destinations.This scope is best when you want to fix malformed events before sending them to all destinations. These transformations should be treated as a temporary solution to hold you over while your engineering team fixes the root event.
Destination scope:Events are transformed in ONLY the selected cloud-mode destination.Device-mode destinations, S3, and data warehouses are not currently supported.Use the Destination scope when you want to customize an event to the unique requirements of a destination. These transformations can exist permanently.
Depending on the type of transformation you selected, you will need to enter the relevant event, property, or trait mappings to create the transformation.
Select an Event:After you select the scope, use the search box to choose the event to transform. You canonlyselect a single track event, identify or group call. If you are renaming the event, simply enter the new name in the provided text field.
Rename properties or traits:To rename properties or traits within a selected event, click+ Add Property. The dropdown that appears contains the properties or traits sent with the selected event. Segment supports JSON Path notation to select nested objects up to four levels deep. For example,order.idselects theidproperty in theorderobject. Segment does not support.$.notation to select a property from an array of objects. For example, the following event, which generatesproducts.$.product_id, is unsupported.
In this scenario, we do not support the transformation of product_id.
After selecting a property/trait, select JSON Path or Simple String to change the property/trait. Simple string will change the name in-line, while JSON path allows you to move the property/trait in or out of an object.
When you see properties that have the escape character\in them - this escape character\is added to differentiate between a property name that has a . in it, and a nested field, like so:
Enter a descriptive name to act as a label for the transformation. This label helps you organize your Transformations, and Segment recommends that you make this descriptive and focused on the problem you’re solving. For exampleFix misnamed order_completed event for ecommerce specis much better thanMap order_completed.
In this step, you can also choose to keep the Transformation disabled, so you can come back and edit it later. To update, enable, or disable a Transformation, click on the overflow menu and selectEdit Transformation.
Here’s a list of Segment Transformations with some use case examples.
Rename an event:Change an event name fromviewed_producttoProduct Viewed.
Rename a property or trait:Change the property namerevenuetototalfor a specific destination.
Update a property value:UseSegment’s Public APIto transform the propertycurrencyto have the valueUSD.
Property Transformations

Typewriter for analytics.js and analytics-node will receive no new features and only critical maintenance updates from Segment. Typewriter for other libraries and SDKs are not actively maintained by Segment. Typewriter is available onGitHubunder the MIT license for the open-source community to fork and contribute.
Typewriteris a tool for generating strongly-typed Segment analytics libraries based on your pre-definedTracking Planspec.
At a high-level, Typewriter can take an event from your Tracking Plan like this"Order Completed"event:

Typewriter uses the event to generate a typed analytics call in different languages:
Typewriter can generate clients foranalytics.js,analytics-node,analytics-swiftandanalytics-kotlin.
These generated clients are embedded with metadata from your Tracking Plan, which contextualizes your analytics instrumentation, and reduces (or entirely eliminates!) incorrect instrumentations in your production environments. In your editor, you can access event names, descriptions, property names, types and more:

You can also configure Typewriter to validate analytic events at runtime, which can alert you to instrumentation errors during development and testing. Typewriter can warn you about missing required properties, invalid enum values, regex mismatches, and any other advancedJSON Schemayou configure in your Tracking Plan.

You can use this with a test suite to automatically fail your unit tests if the instrumentation generates any violations:

If you use a statically typed language (such as TypeScript, Java, Objective-C, or Swift), you get access to compile-time warnings about your instrumentation:

Typewriter also helps teams adoptanalytics best practices, such as avoiding autogenerated event names, and carefully considering what properties are tracked.
To get started, check out one of the quickstart guides below:
For use with the Analytics-iOS and Analytics-Android SDK, useTypewriter v7.

Typewriter is built usingNode.js, and requires node >= 14.x
You can check if you have Node and NPM installed by running the following commands in your command-line window:
If you don’t have these,you’ll need to installnode. Installingnodealso installsnpmandnpxfor you. If you’re on macOS, you can install it withHomebrew:
Once you’ve installed Node and NPM, run the--versioncommands again to verify that they were installed correctly.
To get started with Typewriter in your browser:
Once you’ve gotanalytics.jsinstalled, add Typewriter as a developer dependency in your project:
Runnpx typewriter initto use the Typewriter quickstart wizard that generates atypewriter.ymlconfiguration, along with your first Typewriter client. When you run the command, it creates atypewriter.ymlfile in your project. For more information on the format of this file, see theTypewriter Configuration Reference.
 The command also adds a new Typewriter client in./analytics(or whichever path you configured). You can import this client into your project, like so:
### Configuration for snippet + TypeScript users
### Configuration for NPM users
Runnpx typewriterto regenerate your Typewriter client. You need to do this each time you update your Tracking Plan.
To help you minimize your bundle size, Typewriter supportstree-shakingusing named exports. All generated analytics calls generate and export automatically, so you can import them like so:
Typewriter wraps your analytics calls in anES6Proxy, which helps protect your application from crashing if you make analytics calls with a generated function that doesn’t exist. For example, if anOrder Completedevent didn’t exist in your Tracking Plan in the first example above, then your app would crash with aTypeError: typewriter.orderCompleted is not a function. However, since Typewriter dynamically proxies the underlying function calls, it can detect if a function doesn’t exist, and handle it for you. Typewriter logs a warning message, then fires anUnknown Analytics Call Firedevent into your source. This helps to prevent regressions when you migrate JavaScript projects to Typewriter in bulk. Keep in mind that proxying doesn’t work with named exports.

When you run the command, it creates atypewriter.ymlfile in your repo. For more information on the format of this file, see theTypewriter Configuration Reference.
Note:Runnpx typewriterto regenerate your Typewriter client. You need to do this each time you update your Tracking Plan.
Import your new Typewriter client into your project using XCode. If you place your generated files into a folder in your project, import the project as a group not a folder reference.
When you add the generated client to your Xcode Project you can use as a Swift extension method on any Analytics client object:
For use with theanalytics-androidSDK, useTypewriter v7.
To get started using Typewriter with Kotlin:
Typewriter creates the class file with the package nametypewriter. Segment recommends you to enter the right package name duringnpx typewriter initby choosing to review the Advanced Options for Kotlin. You can also enter the right package name directly intypewriter.yml:
Runnpx typewriterto regenerate your Typewriter client. You need to do this each time you update your Tracking Plan.
You can now use your Typewriter client in your Android Kotlin or Java application as extensions to anyAnalyticsobject:
Kotlin:
Java:
To get started with React Native:
Addtypewriteras a dev dependency in your project once you have the library installed in your project.
Runnpx typewriter initto use the Typewriter quickstart wizard that generates atypewriter.ymlconfiguration along with your first Typewriter client.
This command creates atypewriter.ymlfile in your repo. For more information on the format of this file, see theTypewriter Configuration Reference. The command also adds a new Typewriter / Segment client in./analytics(or whichever path you configured). You can use this interchangeably as a normal React Native Segment client. It contains additional methods for your tracking plan:
From there you can use it with hooks:
Or directly through the client:
Runnpx typewriterto regenerate your Typewriter client. You need to do this each time you update your Tracking Plan.
To update or add a new event to a Typewriter client, first apply your changes to your Tracking Plan. Then run the following:
Typewriter requires a Segment API token to fetch Tracking Plans from theSegment Public API.
You must be a workspace owner to create Segment API tokens.
To create an API token:
Typewriter looks for an API token in three ways, in the following order:
The quickstart wizard prompts you for an API token and stores it in~/.typewriterfor you.
Segment recommends you use aToken Scriptto share an API token with your team. When you use a token script, you can supply your API token as an environment variable (echo $TYPEWRITER_TOKEN), from an.env.file (source .env; echo $TYPEWRITER_TOKEN) or using any other CLI tool for providing secrets.
Segment also recommends you to pipe through your API Token as this will let you keep your token secret, but it also allows you to share it across your team.
Segment is temporarily keeping the Token Script execution for compatibility purposes. Segment might deprecate this feature in the future, and encourages you to execute your script and pipe in the token. For example,echo $TW_TOKEN | typewriter build.
To make the most of Typewriter, Segment recommends installing a few extensions:
JavaScript
Typewriter clients include function documentation adhering to theJSDocspecification. Install the relevant extension below for JSDoc support in your editor:
TypeScript
For intellisense in TypeScript clients, install the relevant extension below for TypeScript support in your editor. If your project is a mix between JavaScript and TypeScript, then you should also install the plugins in the JavaScript section above so that your editor will also support JSDoc intellisense.
iOS
XCode does not require any extra configuration and shows intellisense out-of-the-box.
Android
Android Studio does not require any extra configuration and shows intellisense out-of-the-box.
Segmentstrongly recommendsthat you store your Tracking Plan (plan.json) in a version control system. This guarantees that Typewriter will generate the same client, regardless of any changes you make to your Tracking Plan in the Segment app. Otherwise, changes to your Tracking Plan could lead to broken builds.
Segment recommends that you only check in theplan.json, and generate your Typewriter client during the application build step (by callingnpx typewriter). You can do this ingitwith the following.gitignore:
If this isn’t possible you can also check in the full generated client. Segment, however, doesn’t recommend this method.
Typewriter stores its configuration in atypewriter.ymlfile in the root of your repo. A sample configuration might look like this:
At any time, you can regenerate this file by running the Typewriter quickstart wizard:
Segment is keeping the Token Script execution for compatibility purposes only in v8 of Typewriter. Segment might deprecate this feature in the future, and encourages you to execute your script and pipe in the token. For example,echo $TW_TOKEN | typewriter build.
If your team has a standard way to supply secrets (passwords and tokens) in development environments, whether that’s an.envfile or an AWS-backed secret store, you can configure Typewriter to use it to get a Segment API token.
To configure this, create a token script calledscripts.tokenin yourtypewriter.yml. This script is a string that contains a shell command that, when executed, outputs a valid Segment API token. Here’s aninsecure, example:
To give a real example, Segment stores secrets insegmentio/chamberwhich is backed byAWS Parameter Store. Providing access to a token inchamberlooks like this:
To learn more about thetypewriter.ymlconfiguration format, see theConfiguration Reference.
In yourtypewriter.yml, you can configure a script (scripts.after) that fires after generating a Typewriter client. You can use this to apply your team’s style guide to any of Typewriter’s auto-generated files.
For example, if you want to apply yourprettierformatting toplan.json(the local snapshot of your Tracking Plan), you can use anafterscript like this:
To learn more about thetypewriter.ymlconfiguration format, see theConfiguration Reference.
As mentioned in theBest Practicessection above, Segment recommends that you only check in theplan.json, and not the generated clients, into your version control. Instead, Segment recommends building these clients as part of the build step for your application.
In your CI environment, this usually involves a step to build the Typewriter client. Make sure to build the production client before deploying the application, as explained in theTracking Plan Violation Handlingsection below.
You can also configure Typewriter to validate analytic events at runtime, which can alert you to instrumentation errors during development and testing. By default, Typewriter generates a “development” build, which means that it includes this logic. You can generate a “production” build that omits this logic:
Not all languages support run-time validation. Currently,analytics.jsandanalytics-nodesupport it usingAJV(both for JavaScript and TypeScript projects) whileanalytics-iosandanalytics-androiddo not yet support run-time validation. Typewriter also doesn’t support run-time validation using Common JSON Schema. For languages that don’t support run-time validation, the development and production clients are identical.
Segment recommends you to use a development build when testing your application locally, or when running tests. Segment generally recommendsagainstusing a development build in production, since this includes a full copy of your Tracking Plan which can increase the size of the application.
You can provide a custom handler that fires whenever a violation is seen. By default, this handler logs a warning.
Foranalytics.jsandanalytics-nodeclients, you can configure this handler withsetTypewriterOptions:
A common use case for this handler is to configure Typewriter to detect when your tests are running and if so, throw an error to fail your unit tests. For example:
Typewriter is preconfigured inanalytics-nodeenvironments to throw an error ifNODE_ENV=test, which is set by most Node.js testing libraries such asavaandjest.
Another common use case is to customize how violations are reported to your team. For example, Segment customized this handler to show atoast notificationto developers in-app:

Typewriter only supportstrackcalls. However, you can continue to use the underlying (untyped) analytics instance to performidentify,group,page,screen, andaliascalls.
Not all languages support run-time validation. Currently,analytics.jsandanalytics-nodesupport it usingAJV(both for JavaScript and TypeScript projects) whileanalytics-swiftandanalytics-kotlindon’t support run-time validation. Typewriter also does not support event validation using the Common JSON Schema.

Get started with Segment
Crawling: https://segment.com/docs/protocols/apis-and-extensions/anomaly_detection/
Paragraphs:
Protocols is available as an add-on for Business plans only.See theavailable plans, orcontact Support.
On this page
If you’re using Protocols, you might want to get notifications when an anomaly in event volumes orProtocols violationcounts occurs. This document clarifies what Segment means by anomaly detection, gives examples of anomalies that might be relevant to your business, and provides some example solutions of how to monitor and alert on anomalies using some standard tools available today.
Anomaly detection means finding out when your data collection is broken, missing, or incorrect.
When you first start using Protocols, you might focus on fixing data quality issues for a limited set of business critical events. After those first issues are resolved, you might get notifications if new issues occur or if old issues reoccur, so you can avoid manually monitoring data quality. New issues often occur when a new app version is released, and for many companies, that’s weekly.
The issues you care about for anomaly detection are different for each business. An anomaly for one company could be completely normal for another company. For example, an B2B company would expect a steep drop-off of traffic and event volume on weekends, while a media or entertainment company would expect to see a rise in activity in the evenings and on weekends for their different locales.
Other types of issues you can monitor for include:
There are several easy ways to set up anomaly detection using the destination partner tools you probably already use. Many of these solutions come from Segment customers using Protocols. They use these solutions to help manage data quality and get notified when relevant anomalies are detected.
You can send anomalous events directly from your source to a Slack channel using the Slack (Actions) destination. To get started:
If you’re not using the Slack (Actions) destination to forward violations, Segment recommends that you create a new Segment source to collect all violations and Segment workspace activity. To do this, create a new HTTP source in your workspace, and assign a name that you can easily understand (for example,Protocols Audit Source).
Next, set upViolation forwardingfor each Tracking Plan connected to the Source. Once connected, your sources will look like the following diagram:

Note: When you enable violation forwarding, it counts as 1 MTU toward your monthly MTU limit. If you are on an API plan, all forwarded violations count against your API limit. Violations might also generate costs in downstream destinations and data warehouses.
Once violation forwarding is enabled, you can build a custom anomaly detection solution that works for your business. The examples Segment covers here include:
After you’ve enabledViolation Forwarding,enable the Slack destinationfor your Protocols Audit Source. In the destination’s settings, add an Incoming Webhook URL for the Slack channel you want to push notifications to. Next, add theViolation Generatedevent to theEvent Templates settings.
You can copy and paste the example snippet below into the Event Template field to format the Slack message with the event name, violation description and source name. You can customize this message however you want, including adding @ mentions, and any of theproperties included in the Violation Generated event.
When you’re done, it’ll look like the screenshot below.

Custom dashboards are a great way to focus your teams around the metrics and events that matter most to your business. With a few simple queries you can build a dashboard to share with teams, so everyone can understand how well they’re doing against your data quality objectives. Here’s an example dashboard that combinesforwarded Violationswith production event data to track data quality. See below for detailed SQL queries.

Note: For all queries below, replaceprotocols_audit_sourcewith whatever schema name you set for your forwarded violations source.
Source-level event to violation count comparison:This query produces a table showing the total event and violation counts, along with a ratio of the two, broken out by day. A bar chart from this data can show when violations increase or decrease disproportionately to event volume in a source. This is the first place you would want to check to see if anomalies are occurring.
Ratio of High priority events to violation counts:This query produces a table showing all violations and event counts by day for a single event sent to Segment. A bar chart from this data can show when violations increase or decrease disproportionately to event volume for the single event. Segment recommends selecting a few events that are important for your business (for example,Order Completed,Video Viewed,User Signed Up) and creating a separate query and chart for each event.
Source-level distinct and total violation count (Last 7 days):
This query produces a table that lists all sources connected to a Tracking Plan. For each source, the table shows distinct violations and total violations seen in the source. This table is similar to theviolations summaryview in the Segment app.
Event violation count (Top 10):
This query produces a table listing the top 10 events with the most violations. A bar chart showing the worst offending events is a great way to focus your efforts on fixing the least reliable events.

You can subscribe to a variety of Protocols specific alerts through the workspace Activity Feed settings. To subscribe, visit your workspaceSettings>User Preferences>Activity Notifications>Protocols.
You can forward notifications from Protocols to a new Segment source, which can then send them to notification tools such as Slack webhook.
You can also forward these Protocols alerts to any (cloud-mode) Segment destination that accepts Track calls, including data warehouses. Most customers record these activity feed events to a data warehouse for analysis.
You can enableviolation event forwardingto start delivering violations as Track calls to a Segment source. From there, you can forward the events to any Segment destination that accepts Track calls.
You can also use the Slack Actions destination to set event triggers for context fields, meaning events with violations are sent as Track calls directly from the source.
Consent Managementusers see theSegment Consent Preference Updatedevent automatically added to all existing Tracking Plans after they create their first consent category, or when they create a new Tracking Plan after configuring Consent Management. Segment recommends that you do not remove this event.
To consolidate the views in the Schema tab, Segment automatically convertspageandscreencalls intoPage ViewedandScreen Viewedevents that appear in the Schema Events view. Segment recommends adding aPage ViewedorScreen Viewedevent to your Tracking Plan with any properties you want to validate against. At this time, to validate that a specific named page/screen (analytics.page('Homepage') | analytics.screen('Home')) has a specific set of required properties, you will need to use theJSON Schema.
Each Tracking Plan includes a Changelog, which shows which changes were made by which users. To view it, open a Tracking Plan, click the…button (also known as the dot-dot-dot, or ellipses menu) next to the Edit Tracking Plan button, and clickView Changelog.
The Tracking Plan to Source relationship is a one-to-many relationship. This means you can connect as many Sources to a Tracking Plan as you need. However Segment recommends connecting 1-3 Sources per Tracking Plan, because it’s rare to have more than three Sources that share an identical set of events, especially when tracking events across platforms. For example, many Segment mobile SDKs (iOS and Android) automatically collect events that would not make sense to collect in a web app. Segment doesn’t recommend including events in a Tracking Plan that would never be tracked in a Source.
You can duplicate Tracking Plans in the Segment web app by following theinstructions to copy a tracking plan. You can also use thePublic APIto copy the underlying JSON schema from one Tracking Plan to another.
Segment currently supports the ability tocreate multiple versions of an eventin a Tracking Plan. This is ideal for mobile apps, where a breaking change like adding a new required property to an event could cause all previous app versions on user devices to generate violations. You must manually add acontext.protocols.event_versionproperty to the specific track call so that Segment can correctly validate the event against the defined version. Learn more in theTracking Plan event versioning documentation.
In the Tracking Plan editor, click on the data type dropdown for a given property and toggle “Allow Null Values”. Enabling null values means onlynullvalues will be accepted for that property.
Yes.Tracking Plan Labelsare an excellent way to organize events in a Tracking Plan by priority, platform, product, or similar metadata for each event.
You can search in a Tracking Plan to find a specific event, and then copy the URL for the search results page and share it. You can also filter by label to share a group of events. The person you send the URL to must have access to the Workspace and tracking plan to see the results page. (Seethe Access Management documentationfor more details.)
Yes.Tracking Plan Librariesmakes it easy to create groups of events or properties that can be easily imported into multiple Tracking plans.
No. Unfortunately it’s not yet possible to automatically transfer events from a Tracking Plan to Libraries. To import events into a new event library, import them directly from a source.
Yes. Using thePublic API, you can copy the underlying JSON schema from a Tracking Plan in one Workspace to a Tracking Plan in another Workspace.
If youdiscarded eventsas a part of your original Tracking Plan, you must connect to the same Source and configure identical Schema Controls in your other Workspace so that blocked events behave as expected.
Unfortunately, Sources cannot be connected to more than one Tracking Plan. If you were able to connect more than one Tracking Plan to a Source, it could create conflict if events overlapped.
Segment’s code uses built-in logic to verify if an event exists in the Tracking Plan. If an event does not exist, it will follow the configuration theSchema Configuration settingsfor each source connected to the Tracking Plan.
Unplanned property omission is only supported for cloud-mode destinations. Unplanned properties will not be omitted when they’re sent to device-mode destinations.
When you access a Tracking Plan, you’ll come across two IDs:tp_andrs_. Segment uses the two IDs to identify your Tracking Plan in the two APIs you can use to manage your workspace: thePublic APIand theConfig API.
To view the two IDs for your Tracking Plan, navigate to the Tracking Plan you’d like to view the ID for and select the dropdown next toTracking Plan ID.
If you’re using the Public API, you’ll need the ID that starts withtp_.
If you’re using the Config API, you’ll need the ID that starts withrs.
When you first create your Tracking Plan, you can add events from your Source Schema by selecting theImport events from Sourcebutton on the Tracking Plan editor page. You can manually add these events after you’ve connected your Source Schema to your Tracking Plan by clicking the (+) next to the event on your Source Schema page.
When you initially create your Tracking Plan, you can import events into it from a Source Schema. Manually add these events by clicking the the (+) next to the event in your Source Schema page after connecting your Tracking Plan.
You cannot recover a deleted Tracking Plan and Segment cannot recover it on your behalf. Please delete Tracking Plans with caution.
Violations Daily DigestThe Violations Daily Digest is a great way to keep informed of new violations that might be easy to overlook on the Protocols Violations page. The digest sends one email digest per source, every day at approximately 12AM EST. You cannot currently opt in or out of specific sources.
The digest contains all violations for that source that areuniquein the previous 48 hours. For example, if an eventtestEventhad violations on the first day of the month, then those violations won’t appear in the digest until the third of the month.
The email includes information about the violation to help you track down its source and correct it. It includes the event name and property name fields, the violation type, the number of times that specific type of violation was seen, and the last time it was seen.
Protocols Violations PageThe Protocols Violations page shows a live count for violations. You can adjust the timeframe to show violations in the last hour, the last 24 hours, or the last seven days.
You might see a difference between the count on the Violations page and the count in the Violations email digests. This can happen due to differences between the time periods available (24 hours in in the live page, 48 hours in the daily digest email), and the fact that the digest only showsuniqueviolations. The fields displayed on the Violations page are more detailed than those included in the email digest.
You may see violations related to (root). For example:
These violations are related to your common JSON Schema if you’ve applied custom rules. In this instance (root), refers to the top level of the JSON object (Segment event).
The schema functionality is areactiveway to clean up your data, where the Tracking Plan functionality is aproactive, intentional way to clean and unify all future data. Segment has found that the best data driven companies invest the time required to build strong processes and controls around their data. The investment pays off exponentially.
That being said, there are plenty of scenarios where the reactive Schema functionality solves immediate needs for customers. Often times, customers will use both Schema Controls and Tracking Plan functionality across their Segment Sources. For smaller volume Sources with less important data, the Schema functionality often works perfectly.
Blocked events are blocked from sending to all Segment Destinations, including warehouses and streaming Destinations. When an Event is blocked using a Tracking Plan, it does not count towards your MTU limit. They will, however, count toward your MTU limit if you enableblocked event forwardingin your Source settings.
Segment doesn’t store unplanned properties and properties omitted due to JSON Schema Violations in Segment logs. Segment drops omitted properties from the events. You can find the omitted properties in thecontext.violationsobject of an event payload. If you forward Violations to a new source, then you can also see the omitted properties in the Violation Generated event underviolationFieldin thepropertiesobject.
Segment only stores fully blocked events for 30 days.
If you’re seeing unplanned properties/traits in your payload despite using Schema Controls, you might want to select a new degree of blocking controls.
Segment’sSchema Controlsprovide three options to omit properties/traits. Select the one that aligns with your requirements:
The source schema only validates events against the oldest event version in a Tracking Plan. If, for example, you have a version 1 and version 2 of your Tracking Plan, the schema only checks against version 1 of your Tracking Plan.
Blocking events within aSource SchemaorTracking Planexcludes them from API call and MTU calculations, as the events are discarded before they reach the pipeline that Segment uses for calculations.
Warehouse connectors don’t use data type definitions for schema creation. Thedata typesfor columns are inferred from the first event that comes in from the source.
You can only use schema controls to block events at the point that they are ingested into Segment. When you forward an event that Segment has previously ingested from another source, that event bypasses the pipeline that Segment uses to block events and cannot be blocked a second time.
If you create a destination scoped transformation and request a replay for that destination, the transformation will transform events into the destination. Segment doesn’t recommended requesting a replay to resend events to a destination as that will likely result in duplicate events in the destination.
To reduce the risk of creating circular and conflicting transformations, Segment only allows a single transformation to be created for each distinct source, event, destination and type pairing. That means you cannot create twoRename track eventtransformations for aorder_completedevent. This eliminates the possibility of different stakeholders creating conflicting transformations to satisfy their own needs. It also simplifies the Transformations list view, making it much easier to sort and filter by source, event, destination, etc.
In early transformations prototypes, Segment allowed users to select multiple events and destinations for a single transformation rule. Segment realized, however, that this created a structure that was impossible to scale, and likely to generate unintended consequences. For example, if Segment allows multiple track events to be selected for a property name change, it’d be possible to create conflicting changes. Instead, by enforcing a single event, Segment can check to see if a transformation rule exists and smartly link you to that rule using a warning.
Only workspace admins are allowed to create transformations.
All users with Protocols admin or read-only permissions can view transformations.
Transformations introduce advanced logic that at scale may impact performance of client-side libraries. If you are interested in testing new functionality which supports device-mode destination transformations in analytics.js, contact your account rep.
That depends. If you are working with source-level Transformations, the Protocols conversion will come first. If you are dealing with a destination scoped transformation (which is set to only impact data going to a specific destination), Destination Filters will be applied prior to Protocols Transformations.
Transformations are but one tool among many to help you improve data quality. Segment highly recommends that all customers interested in improving data quality start with a well defined Tracking Plan. The Tracking Plan serves as a roadmap for how you want to collect data. Without a clear roadmap, it’s nearly impossible to build alignment around how transformations should be used to improve data quality, leading to more data quality issues than it solves.
Transformations are not applied to events sent through theEvent Tester. The Event Tester operates independently from the Segment pipeline, focusing solely on testing specific connections to a destination. For a transformation to take effect, the event must be processed through the Segment pipeline.
This error occurs because there is a limit of 200 rules per API update. This restriction is by design to ensure stable API performance. Segment is not able to increase this limit on your behalf. To work around this, split your update into smaller batches, each with 200 or fewer rules.

On this page
When you first log in, you go to your workspace. (If you’re a member of several workspaces, you get to choose which one to go to.) Workspaces organize sets of sources and destinations into a central location.
Want a video tour of the Segment workspace? Head over to Segment University! (Must be logged in to access.)
A workspace is a group of sources that can be administered and billed together. Workspaces help companies manage access for multiple users and data sources. Workspaces let you collaborate with team members, add permissions, and share sources across your whole team using a shared billing account.
When you first log in to your Segment account, you can create a new workspace, or choose to log into an existing workspace if your account is part of an existing organization.
This is a Segment workspace.

The first thing you see is a graph of the sources and destinations you have connected to Segment. Sources send data to your workspace: these are your mobile apps, server sources, and website-based sources. Destinations are tools which get the data, and can also include warehouses, which just store large amounts of data for later reuse and analysis.
The graph on this overview page includes lines which can show you which sources send data to which destinations. If this is the first time you’re looking at your workspace and you haven’t set it up yet, it won’t look quite like this.
In the left navigation bar, you see the main parts of the Segment application:Sources,Destinations,Privacy,Engage, andProtocols, if your subscription includes them.
You can also find the Catalog in the left navigation, which lists the sources you can collect data from, and the destinations you can send data to.
You can always click the Segment logo in the top left corner to get back to the Overview page.

The Sources tab lists everything that is sending data to your Segment workspace. Sources are organized by type: website, mobile, sever, or by cloud-app type, like CRM or payments.
Each source has a status and a list of destinations. A source’s status tells you whether or not the source is sending data to Segment, and how long it’s been since Segment last saw data from the source. The source’s destinations list shows you which destinations are receiving data from that source. You can expand them for more detail.

The Destination tab lists all of the destinations connected to your workspace. These are sorted into categories like analytics, email marketing, and other tool types. The list also shows whether or not Segment is sending data to that tool, or if the tool is enabled or disabled.

Next up is the Catalog. The catalog includes a list of allsourcesanddestinationsavailable in Segment. You can search either by category or name. When you click on a catalog tile, the tile shows instructions on how to connect the tool to your Segment workspace.
The Catalog is always growing, so check out the “New and Noteworthy” section from time to time to see what’s new.
If you have Engage or Protocols enabled in your workspace, you’ll see sections for those too. Engage helps you use your Segment data to build audiences and better understand your users, and Protocols helps you structure and maintain the format of the data you send through Segment.
These features are fairly advanced, but you can learn more about them byrequesting a demo, or reading more in theEngage documentation, and theProtocols documentation.
TheWorkspace Settingstab shows more information about your workspace, including your team settings, GDPR requests, and so on. You might not have access to edit these settings.
TheUser Preferencestab shows your individual account settings, including Notification settings.
TheActivity Notificationsfeature in Notification settings provides alerts for specific workspace activities when enabled. These alerts keep you updated on actions taken by other workspace users, excluding activities you initiate. This ensures you’re only alerted to actions you’re not directly involved in.
TheUsagetab shows how many API calls orMonthly Tracked Users (MTUs)your workspace has used this month - which can be important for keeping an eye on your Segment bill.
TheHealthtab lists any repeated or consistent errors, which can help alert you to misconfigurations or data issues which you can correct.
Issues on the Health tab are sorted by Sources, Destinations, Warehouses, and again by type.

If errors are present, they’re sorted by type and include information about how long ago they were last seen and how many times they’ve occurred. You can click the wrench icon on an individual error line to view the Event Delivery tool and see the erroring payload and response. You can also disable or delete the erroring integration from this menu.
The Privacy Portal allows you to inspect data coming into your Segment account, check it for Personally Identifying Information (PII), classify it based on how sensitive the information is, and then determine which categories of data to send to different destinations. Read more about these tools in thePrivacy Portal documentation.

Paragraphs:
On this page
Segment’s Workspace Home serves as a dashboard that gives you a single consolidated view of the workspace, its health and status, and metrics for specific integrations over time.
Availability
The Workspace Home is visible to users who have the Workspace Ownerrole. If you have access to the Home page, it is the first screen you see when you log in to your Segment Workspace.
The Home page shows a summary of errors in the workspace’s sources and destinations, a list of “favorite” integrations that you can configure, and information about recent audit logged events, and your billing plan usage.

The Workspace Home page shows when the data it represents was last updated. You can click theUpdatedline to refresh the display.
You can also use the drop-down menu at the right to choose between a 24-hour and 7-day rolling view of the data. The page automatically updates the graphs and statistics when you change your selection.
The Sources section of the Home pages shows a summary of the event volume flowing through Segment.
If your Segment plan includes Protocols, the dashboard showsEvent Violationsoccurring in the workspace, including a graph over time. You can click into the violations section to see a list of sources ordered from highest number of violations, to lowest. You can click into individual sources to see more details and go to their individual source pages, orgo to the Violations page.

If your Segment plan does not include Protocols, an Events Received chart is shown to reflect the number of events received across sources.
The Destinations section of the Home page shows a summary of the Event Delivery for the workspace, including a graph over time. You can click thedestinationslink to see a list of destinations with delivery problems, ordered from highest to lowest error rate. You can click a destination to see more details about the delivery failures, and from the details panel click the destination name to go directly to its configuration page.

If you have access to the Workspace Home page, you can customize it for yourself by bookmarking or saving “favorite” integrations. These could be sources, destinations, storage destinations, and functions that you work with regularly, or want to monitor closely.
These Home page favorites are specific to your user account in the workspace. The are not shared among administrators in the same workspace, and are not accessible from other workspaces you might be an administrator for.
To create a favorite, clickAdd Favoriteor the plus icon, and select the integration(s) to bookmark. The list that appears displays a status icon for each integration, so you can tell which ones are healthy (green) and unhealthy (red), and which ones are inactive (gray).
Once you create a favorite, the section displays your favorites in tabs so you can view sources only, destinations only (including storage destinations), or all of them at once. Each favorite displays important configuration details and summary statistics for that integration. You can click themore(…) menu to jump directly to one of the configuration or detail pages for that integration.
To delete a favorite, click themore(…) menu and selectRemove favorite.
For users with Business Tier workspaces, the recent activity section displays the most recent items logged to the Segment Audit trail. This includes workspace membership changes and requests, changes to the configuration of different Segment features (including sources, destinations, and to Engage and Protocols configurations), and data storage sync failures.
The Usage section shows a summary of the workspace’s plan utilization for the current billing period. This includes billing information for all parts of your Segment plan. This includesMTUs or API call volume(as applicable), Functions usage time (if applicable), and Engage details (if applicable). Clickview allto go to the workspace’s billing page for more detailed statistics.

Advanced Access Management is available for all Business plans.See theavailable plans, orcontact Support.
On this page
Segment’s access management tools let Workspace Owners manage which users can access different parts of their Segment workspaces. The Access Management page has three tabs:Users (team members),User Groups, andTokens.
Access settings are applied at the workspace level. A Segment user can have access to one or more workspaces and can have differentrolesin each workspace.
Users access their Segment account with either email/password credentials, theirTwilio credentials, or by usingSingle Sign On.
Workspace Ownerscan download a CSV list of users who have access to a specific workspace (including their roles) from the Access Management page in the Segment app.
You can select a user in the table to see theirroles. Check out theRoles documentationfor more details.
With Twilio Unified Login, Twilio users can use their Twilio email, password, and authentication settings to access several Twilio products, including Twilio Messaging, SendGrid, and Segment. You can also use Sign up With Google to create your Twilio account. Once you link your Segment account to your Twilio credentials, you can access Segment directly from the Twilio console using theTwilio Product Switcher.
Segment invitations and sign ups that are redirected to Twilio’s sign up page must adhere to Twilio’sminimum password and 2FA requirements. To learn more, view Twilio’sAccount Managementdocumentation.
Any existing Segment user must adhere to existing password requirements and 2FA settings set at the Workspace level.
You can access Segment from the Twilio Console using the Product Switcher. For more information, view the Twilio support articleGetting Started with the Unified Login and Product Switcher.
Twilio Unified Login users can manage their Segment user settings, including name, email, password, and 2FA settings, directly in their Twilio account. To learn more about Twilio’s user and password policies, review Twilio’sAccount Managementdocumentation.
Existing Segment users can still use their credentials to access Segment.
Segment continues to supportSSOand SCIM, as users who need to access an SSO enabled workspace will be directed to authenticate through the configured Identity Provider.

A SegmentTeam Memberis an individual with access to a workspace. A Segment user can be associated with one or more workspaces, either as anownerormemberof each.
Check out theroles documentationfor a complete list of roles.
The user session for a Segment Team Member is 7 days. Team Members in aHIPAA eligible workspacehave a 15 minute user session across all workspaces.
If you are a Team Member in a HIPAA eligible workspace and want to access a non-HIPAA eligible workspace with a 7 day user session, you can create an alias (for examplename+workspace@gmail.com).
AUser Groupis a set of Team Members with a set of shared policies. A Segment Team Member can be a member of one or many Groups. All roles in the Segment App are additive, which means that group membership can be assigned in addition to individual roles for a single team member. For example, a single user could inherit roles from a Group definition AND have access to additional resources through individually assigned roles.
You can generate tokens to programmatically access Segment resources using theSegment Public API.

Resources are the building blocks of Segment, and represent the different parts of your Segment deployment to which you can grant access. These include:
Workspace owners can use Labels to grant users access to groups of resources. When you add a Label to a Source or Spaces, any users who are granted access to that Label gain access to those resources.
To create or configure labels, go to theLabelstab in your workspace settings. Only workspace Owners can manage labels for the entire workspace.

Crawling: https://segment.com/docs/segment-app/iam/roles/
Paragraphs:
On this page
A role gives a user access to resources within a workspace. Roles are additive, and can combine to configure a custom policy for a Team Member or a Group. A policy is at least one role plus one resource applied to an individual user or group.
When a user has both User Permissions and Group Permissions, they will have the highest access given to either of those roles.
All Segment workspaces have the following roles, regardless of account type.
The following roles are only available to Segment Business Tier accounts.
Full edit and view access to all entity models and connection details.
Read-only access, with the ability to view entity models.
The Segment App doesn’t show detected Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to workspace members if the information matches specific expected formats for PII. When PII Access turnsoff, detected PII is masked based onred or yellow default matchersand anycustom matchersdefined in the Privacy Portal.
Workspace Owners can grant specific individuals or groups access to PII from their Access Management settings. PII Access only applies to the resources a user or user group has access to; it doesn’t expand a user’s access beyond the original scope. All Workspace Owners have PII access by default.
For example, users with PII Access and Source Admin/Read-Only permissions can view any PII present in the Source Debugger. However, users with the PII Access role don’t have Privacy Portal access.
Only users with the Workspace Owner role can access the Privacy Portal.
When managing destination connections in an Engage space, you may require additional permissions.
To connect two resource instances, you must have access to both. You can either grant this access to all resources, or to the specific resources you want to connect.
To connect a source to warehouseyou must haveSource AdminandWarehouse Adminaccess for the source and the warehouse.
To connect source to tracking planrequiresSource AdminandTracking Plan Adminaccess for the source and the tracking plan.
Toviewtransformations, you needSource Read-only, either for all Sources or the specific Sources using Protocols.

This page explains how to addTeam MembersandUser Groupsto your team’s workspace, how to assign themroles, and how to remove them.
Note: Only Workspace Owners can change a workspace’s Access Management settings.
Note: Workspaces that are on Free or Team plans can only grant theworkspace ownerandsource adminroles.
Tip: You can also grant the role for all current and future resources. For admin roles, this includes the ability to create new resources.
Workspace Owners can manage permissions for groups of team members who should have similar access using “user groups”.
You can make changes to group membership from two places in the Segment App: From the Edit Team Member page (the user’s individual access page), and from the Edit User Group page, where you can see all members of the group.

To add a team member from theEdit Team Memberpage:
Tip: This method is best when adding asingleteam member to one or more user groups.

To add a team member from theEdit User Grouppage:
Tip: This method is best when adding more than one user to a single user group at the same time
Open the member details and clickRemove Team Memberat the top.
If you are on a Business plan and choose to use Single Sign On (SSO), you grant implicit access to your workspace by assigning team members access to Segment from your identity provider. By default, you grant these usersminimal workspace access.
Segment supports “Just-In-Time” user provisioning using SSO. Any users with access to the application as defined in your IDP can seamlessly create a Segment account when they first log in. By default, all automatically-provisioned users created this way are created as Workspace Members with Minimal Workspace Access.
Once they have been created, Workspace Owners can update these users’ access from theAccess Managementpage in the Segment App.
Segment does not support programmatic de-provisioning at this time. However, if your workspace uses SSO, a user that cannot authenticate to your IDP cannot view or edit any of your workspaces or their contents.
If you are aworkspace member, you might encounter a section of the Segment App that you do not have access to view. If you need expanded permissions, you can request access directly in the Segment App. Once submitted, Access requests are sent to all workspace owners by email.
To review an access request, workspace owners click the link in the access request email to go to their workspace’s Access Management Settings. The requestor’s access request message appears on the Segment Access Management page, and the workspace owner can adjust the user’s permissions. The access request message disappears after the permissions are updated.
When you send an invitation to an incorrect email address or the token included in the email invite link expires, the invite might still show up as “Invite Pending” in the Segment App. In these cases, you can revoke the invite to remove it and resend the invite if needed. The invitation will expire within a few days. Therefore, if a user accepts an invite with an expired link, Segment does not grant them access.

Labels allow workspace owners to assign permissions to users to grant them access to groups. Groups represent collections of Sources, or collections of Spaces.
To create or configure labels, go to theLabelstab in your workspace settings. Only workspace Owners can manage labels for the entire workspace.
All workspaces include labels forDev(development) andProd(production) environments. Business Tier customers can create an unlimited number of labels.
By default, all workspaces include labels for Dev (development) and Prod (production) environments. Workspace owners can configure what these labels are applied to, and can create up to five custom environments.
Labels must be inkey:valueformat, both the key and value must begin with a letter, and they can only contain letters, numbers, hyphens or dashes.
To apply labels to Sources and Spaces, click theAssign Labelstab from the Labels screen. In the screen that appears, select the Sources and Spaces to apply the label to.
Once a label is in use (either assigned to a resource or used to restrict permissions on a user), the label cannot be deleted. You must first manually remove the label from any resources and permissions before you can delete it.
While only Workspace Owners can bulk-edit labels, Source and Space admins can edit the labels on the sources and spaces they have access to. To do this, go to theSettingstab for each item.
Workspace owners can also grant specificRolesaccess to specific labels. For example, you might give a Source Admin access to only Sources that have theProdlabel.
Permissions can then be assigned to users in Access Management by label, on the Source Admin, Source Read-Only, Engage Admin, Engage User and Engage Read-Only users.

Note: All Segment workspaces can create up to five custom labels. Additional label types (in addition to environment labels) are available to Segment Business Tier accounts.
To create additional custom labels, a workspace owner can create new key types in the Labels screen. The workspace owner can customize any combination of labels to mirror how resources should be partitioned in their organization. For example, some organizations may prefer to restrict access on their Sources and Spaces by brand or product area while other organizations may find it more useful to restrict their resources by tech stack or engineering department.
When you create a new key, it becomes available in the Sources page as a column type that can be used to organize sources.
Workspace owners can create labels for sources and Spaces from the Segment workspaceSettings->Admin->Labels.
Labels currently only apply to Sources and Spaces.
Workspace owners can assign bulk assign labels to sources and Spaces using the “Assign Labels” tab in theLabelsscreen. Source admins and Space admins can edit the labels on their individual resources in the “Settings” tab.
Once a label has been created and has been assigned to resources within the workspace, workspace owners can use these labels to restrict permissions on user access, restrict which sources can be connected to a space through a Connection Policy, and organize sources by viewing these labels as columns in the Sources page.
Workspace owners can only delete a label if it is not being used (either assigned to a resource or used to restrict permissions on a user). First, manually remove the label from any resources or user permissions.
No, a label cannot be renamed. If you need to rename a label, we recommend you create the new label, and then assign it to all resources named the old label before deleting the old label.
(for example, a source as both brand:A and brand:B))
No, you can only assign one value per category. This is to ensure there is no confusion in logic around permissions. For example, if a user is assigned permission to brand:A, it would be unclear to the workspace owner if this user gets access to a source labeled bothbrand:Aandbrand:Bor only sources with the sole labelbrand:A.
Labels are additive, so you can only further restrict a user’s permissions by adding more labels. If a user has access to everything labeled environment:production, we assume no restrictions on any other category of label. This user has less restricted permissions than another user who has access to everything withenvironment:productionANDregion:apac.
For example, if the following sources had these set of labels:
Then the following through users with Source Admin restricted with Labels will only have access to the following Sources:
You can only assign one set of additive labels on a per-user basis. However, to give a user who needs access to all sources labeledbrand:aorbrand:b, we recommend that you use Group permissions and assign this user to two separate groups, where one group has Source Admin access tobrand:aand the other has Source Admin access tobrand:b.

Paragraphs:
Audit Trail is only available in Business plan workspaces.See theavailable plans, orcontact Support.
On this page
The Audit Trail allows you to view the last 90 days of user and system activity, filter activity for specific actions or actors, and export your data to an event streams source or CSV file.
For any requests exceeding the 90-day timeframe, contactSegment Supportfor assistance.
Viewing the Audit Trail requires Workspace Owner permissions
You must have the Workspace Owner role to view the Audit Trail page. For more information about roles and permissions within Segment, see theRoles documentation.
To view the Audit Trail:
The Audit Trail returns information about the following Segment product areas:
To view a list of all events Segment surfaces in the Audit Trail, open the Audit Trail, clickFilters, and select theEventsdropdown.
Use the Filters dropdown to refine your search results and filter by actions or actors to see who made changes on specific resources in the app. Actors include both logged-in users and access tokens.
You can forward events in your workspace to anevent streams sourceto set up real-time alerts and quickly revert changes (like a user unintentionally disabling a warehouse) that could cause unwanted downstream effects.
Segment recommends creating a dedicated source for Audit Trail events
Segment recommends forwarding all events to an instance of theHTTP APIsource.  Segment passes all forwarded events through its entire processing pipeline. This ensures that Tracking Plans, Filters, and other features work with the audit events, and also ensures you can send those events to multiple downstream destinations.
To forward Audit Trail events to an event streams source:
When you forward audit events to a source, Segment passes those events through its entire processing pipeline. This ensures that tracking plans, filters, and other features work with the audit events, and also ensures you can send those events to multiple downstream destinations.
An audience/computed trait Run or a Sync may fail on its first attempt, but Engage will retry up to 5 times before considering it a hard failure and display on that audience/compute trait’s Overview page. As long as the runs/syncs within the specific Audience’s Overview page say they are successful, then these can be safely ignored.
How things work internally:Segment Engage scheduler fetches audiences/traits from compute service and then handles the logic of generating tasks. These compute/sync tasks get scheduled and executed by another worker. Essentially, these tasks are a list of steps to be executed. Each task has a series of steps that are marked as complete by saving a timestamp for the completion. If the worker is disrupted, it picks up at the latest step, which has no completed_at timestamp. In some cases, the step may fail or the entire task may fail (for example, due to timeout or the worker disruption as there are many moving parts). In either case, these failures will be retried.
These tasks are a part of internal Segment process, and there are systems in place to retry failed tasks. In most cases, it is not necessary to track these failures, as long as there are no actual computation or sync failures.
The Audit Trail logic, however, is configured to notify you about every task failure, even if it then later succeeds.
If you would like to avoid receiving the notifications for transient failures,reach out to supportto request enabling a setting to reduce the number of notifications your workspace receives.

Paragraphs:
Single Sign-on is only available in Business plan workspaces.See theavailable plans, orcontact Support.
On this page
Segment supports Single Sign On for Business Tier accounts. You can use any SAML-based Identity Provider (IdP), for example Okta, Bitium, OneLogin, or Centrify, or use GSuite to serve as your identity provider, delegating access to the application based on rules you create in your central identity management solution.
With SSO, you have centralized control over your users’ ability to authenticate or not in your IdP. You can also enforce rules like two-factor authentication or password rotation at the IdP level.
You can configure as many IdP connections to your workspace as needed to support IdP-initiated authentication. This allows seamless migration from one system to a new one, if, for example, your organization switches IdP vendors or switches from GSuite to a dedicated SAML IdP like Okta or OneLogin.
To enable SSO-based login from the Segment login page (app.segment.com/login), you must first verify that you own the domain, and connect it to your organization’s Segment account. After you have done that, SSO users from your domain can use the Segment login page to access your default Segment workspace.
The Segment login page can only be connected to one workspace. To use your IdP with multiple workspaces, you will have to initiate login to the other workspaces from the IdP instead of through the login portal.
Segment’s SSO configuration is entirely self-service. Additionally, Segment has prebuilt connections withOkta,OneLogin, andMicrosoft Entra IDwhich can help you get set up faster.Reach out to supportif you run into any questions or issues.
To get started, go to your workspace settings and navigate toAuthentication > Connections > Add new Connection. Follow the steps to create a SAML connection.


Segment officially supports apps for Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, and OneLogin. Next, find Segment in your IdP’s app catalog, and follow the set up instructions they provide.
If you’re using a different IdP, you must create a custom SAML-based application.
Your provider will ask you for a few things from Segment, which Segment provides in the setup flow:

For GSuite configurations, make sure theStart URLfield in Service Provider Details is left blank.
Different IdPs have different names for the Audience URL. Some call it “Audience URI”, some call it “Entity ID”, some call it “Service Provider Entity ID.” It’s likely there are only two required fields without correct defaults, and they correspond to theSSO URLandAudience URLvalues above.
In all IdPs Segment works with, the defaultNameIDoption is the correct one. Make sure it’s using theemailAddressschema.
In all IdPs Segment works with, the default connection encryption options are the correct ones. (Signed Response & Assertion Signature with SHA256, Unencrypted Assertions).
Different IdPs store records of your employees differently. The only attribute mapping Segment requires is to make sure you’re sendingemail. In Okta this is atuser.email. In Duo this ismail.
Make sure you’ve enabled “send all attributes” (not just NameID) if applicable for your IdP.
NoRelayStateis required. This is also sometimes calledTarget.
After you create the application in your IdP, you can come back to Segment and click “Next”.
Your IdP provides a URL and x.509 certificate. Copy them into their respective fields in Segment.

Then, click “Configure Connection.”
You’re all set.
Back at the connections page, make sure your connection is enabled with the switch on the right.

You can now test using IdP-initiated SSO (by clicking login to Segment from within your IdP) is working correctly. If not, double check the IdP configuration gotchas section above.
For most customers, Segment recommends requiring SSO for all users. If you do not require SSO, users can still log in with a username and password. If some members cannot log in using SSO, Segment also supports SSO exceptions.
These options are off by default, but you can configure them on theAdvanced Settingspage. Log in using SSO to toggle theRequire SSOsetting.

To configure GSuite for use with Segment, go to your workspace settings and choose the “Connections” tab under “Authentication” and click “Add New Connection.” Follow the steps to create a “Google Apps For Work” connection.
Enter your domain (or, if you’ve verified it already, choose it from the dropdown) and then click the resulting link to authorize the connection.
Segment supports SSO on the login page for emails that match your workspace’s domain.
In order to enable this, you’ll need to verify your domain with Segment. To do that, go to the “Domains” tab under “Authentication” in the workspace settings page.

Enter your domain and click “Add Domain.” When you click verify, you’re given two options to verify your domain, either using a meta tag to add to your/index.htmlat the root, or a DNS text record that you can add through your DNS provider. After you do so and click verify, you can move to the next step.
Domain tokens expire 14 days after they are verified.
To configure SSO for multiple workspaces, your admin must configure access to each workspace as a separate app in your identity provider. You are unable to use verified domain(s) across multiple workspaces and will encounter the following error if you add a domain that is already verified in another workspace:
Warning: This domain has already been claimed.
After your administrator configures separate apps for each workspace in your IdP, the end-users can log in to the IdP and click on the relevant app for the workspace you are trying to access. This is also referred to as IdP-initiated SSO.
The Okta/Segment SAML integration supports the following features:
For more information on these features, visit theOkta Glossary.
To set up the Okta/Segment SAML integration, you’ll first carry out several steps in Segment, then finish in Okta.
Follow these steps in Segment to set up the Okta/Segment SAML integration:

Finish setting up the Okta/Segment SAML integration by carrying out these steps in Okta:

You’ve now completed setup. For SP-initiated SSO, follow these steps:
Segment supports “just in time” user permissioning; new users who authenticate using your IdP are automatically created in Segment as minimal-access (read-only) members. If the user already exists in Segment then Segment associates the IdP-identity with the existing Segment user account. Segment also supports user provisioning and role mappingusing SCIM.
Yes, users can be automatically de-provisionedif you use SCIM.
Segment allows users to own their own workspaces. While your IdP authentication will ensure that any non-owners must have logged in with SSO to accessyour workspace, they can still log into Segment with a username and password to access their own workspaces.
Workspace owners can invite additional owners with any domain using the traditional invite mechanism. If the workspace is configured to require SSO, and the user is not on your IdP, you can add an Exemption underWorkspace Settings > Authentication > Advanced Settings.
After SSO is configued to access multiple workspaces, you will have slightly different signin experience in the below scenarios

Crawling: https://segment.com/docs/segment-app/iam/scim/
Paragraphs:
Single Sign-on is only available in Business plan workspaces.See theavailable plans, orcontact Support.
On this page
The SCIM specification is designed to make managing user identities in cloud-based applications like Segment easier. SCIM allows your Identity Provider (IdP) to manage users and groups within your Segment workspace.
Most IdPs offer SCIM, and it complements SAML. You can think of SAML as a way for your employees to authenticate and SCIM as a way to make sure they have the appropriate permissions.
Before you start, remember that SSO is only available to Business Tier customers, and that only workspace owners may configure SSO connections.
To set up SCIM, you must first create an SSO connection. Once youcreate your SSO connection, log back in to Segment using SSO.
Segment officially supportsOkta,Microsoft Entra ID, andOneLogin. Each link includes specific setup instructions for that IdP. You should read thefeaturessection of this page to understand which features of SCIM Segment supports.
You may still be able to use SCIM with another Identity Provider (IdP) by adapting the following instructions.
Your IdP needs to know where to send SCIM requests. The Segment base URL is: https://scim.segmentapis.com/scim/v2
The other value you need is an API key (sometimes referred to as an Authorization Header). To generate one, go toSettings > Advanced Settingsin the Segment app, and find theSSO Syncsection. ClickGenerate SSO Tokenand copy the generated token. Use this token for the API key or Authorization Header in your IdP.
You can find this page in thesettings sidebar of your Segment app.

It’s important to remember that Segment has a multi-tenant user/workspace relationship, meaning that users can be part of more than one workspaces. In most cases these workspaces are all related to a single customer (for example, a single company might have individual workspaces for different brands or subsidiaries). However, some users can be members of workspaces for different Segment customers, such as with contractors or consultants.
Because of this, Segment must balance the autonomy of users with the desired level of control of a Workspace Owner.
Even though Segment users exist separately from workspaces, your IdP can create a new Segment user or add an existing Segment user to your workspace using the same IdP workflow. This process is transparent to the IdP and to you as the customer. In other words, you don’t need to know if a user exists before adding them to your workspace.
If the person you want to add does not have a Segment account, your IdP will create one. If the person already has a Segment account, you can still add them to your Workspace using your IdP, but itdoes not create a new Segment account.
You can create new users and set theiruserName(email) anddisplayName(single value field that represents a user’s full name) using your IdP.
If a user already has a Segment account, you can add them using their email address using your IdP. However, Segment ignores thedisplayNamesent by the IdP, and instead uses the name chosen by the user when they created their account.
Segment user profiles only contain auserName(email) anddisplayName. Once you create a user, you cannot update these attributes using SCIM. They can only be updated by the user through the Segment UI.
Segment workspace ownerscannotdeleteSegment workspace member accounts using SCIM, the web UI, or the Segment API. A user must delete their own account using the Segment app. Workspace ownerscanremove members from the workspaceusing SCIM, the web UI, or the Segment API.
Some IdPs want to set users as “inactive” or “active.” Segment does not have an “inactive” state for user accounts. Similar functionality can be achieved by removing a user from your workspace. Setting an existing Segment user to “active” is similar to adding that user to the workspace.
When your IdP updates a user to setactive: false, or attempts to delete a user, Segment removes the user from your Segment workspace. If your IdP attempts to create a user with an existing email, or setactive: trueon an existing user, Segment adds that existing user account to your workspace.
Any Segment group membershipsmust be reassignedwhen a user is removed and re-added from your workspace. Newly added workspace users have the “Minimal Workspace Access” permission by default. The “Minimal Workspace Access” role does not have access to any sources, destinations, etc.
This reassignment might happen automatically depending on how you configured your IdP. If the user was assigned groups using your IdP, your IdP should automatically re-add the user within Segment. For this reason, Segmentstronglyrecommends that you create groups in your IdP, push them into Segment, and maintain an active link between your IdP and Segment.
Your IdP can create new groups in Segment using SCIM. All groups created using SCIM start with “Minimal Workspace Access.” The “Minimal Workspace Access” permission does not have access to any sources, destinations, etc. To add more permissions to a group you must use the Segment web app.
Your IdP can add or remove workspace members from existing groups using SCIM. Your IdP can also update Segment group names.
Your IdP can use SCIM to delete groups from your Segment workspace. Deleting a group in Segment doesnotremove its members from your workspace. To remove members from the workspace, unassign the users from Segment from your IdP, then Segment removes them from the workspace.
When you integrate Segment SCIM and your IdP you might need to map attributes for users. The only attributes that Segment SCIM supports areuserNameanddisplayName. You should leave any existing mapping for theemailSAML attribute, which you might have set up during your initial SSO setup. This mapping supports SAML authentication, and is separate from setting up SCIM, but may be within the same page depending on your IdP.
You’ll need to map an email (IdP) touserName(Segment). Depending on your IdP this attribute might be calledemailormail. If your IdP uses emails for usernames, you can mapuserName(IdP) touserName(Segment).
If your IdP supports thedisplayNameattribute, you can map it directly to the SegmentdisplayNameattribute. If it does not, most IdPs can create a “macro mapping” which allows you to map more than one field to a single field in Segment.
For example, you might map{firstName} {lastName}from your IdP todisplayNamein Segment. If your IdP doesn’t support this, you can mapfirstName(IdP) todisplayName(Segment).
Generate an API key, then copy and paste this value into theAPI Tokenfield in Okta, and clickSave.

Click theAssignmentstab. You can now assign people or groups. Before you continue, read through thefeatures sectionin this doc to make sure you understand how groups work. Segment recommends that you assign users to the Segment app by Okta group. This allows you to manage which groups in your organization can authenticate to Segment. You can also assign users individually.

Once you assign your users, push the assigned Okta groups to Segment.

Tip: You can also link Okta groups to an existing group from in the Segment app using the Okta UI.

Paragraphs:
MFA is available to all Segment plans, but cannot be used with SSO.See theavailable plans, orcontact Support.
On this page
Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) provides an additional layer of security when logging into your Segment account. When MFA is enabled, users must enter their username and password, and a one-time use code. Users can either enable MFA for their own account, or workspace owners can require that all users in a workspace use MFA. These security settings are available in the workspace from the “Advanced Settings” section.
You can configure your Segment workspace to send a text message code (U.S. and Canada only), or use an authentication app to generate a time-based token (for exampleGoogle Authenticator,1Password, orAuthy). You can also log in using a recovery code in case you don’t have your MFA device available. When you configure MFA, be sure to save your recovery code in safe place so you can access your Segment account in the event you lose your MFA device.
We highly recommend that youchoose a strong passwordand also enable MFA for the email account that you use to log into Segment. If someone is able to gain access to your email, they will be able to access your Segment account even if your Segment account has MFA enabled.
MFA is available to all Segment customers that are notlogged in using SSO. If your company uses SSO to sign in to Segment, you should enable MFA at the SSO provider. Contact your company’s IT team if you have questions about your company’s SSO configuration.
Once MFA is enabled, Segment prompts you for one of these methods every time you log in.
Your recovery code can be used bypass in the event you do not have your MFA device. If you no longer have access to your recovery code, you can choose to send a recovery code to your email to re-access your Account.

Segment’s dbt extension lets you useReverse ETLwith your existing dbt labs models and syncs to help centralize model management and versioning, reduce redundancies, and run CI checks to prevent breaking changes.
With Segment’s dbt extension, you can:
This page explains how to set up a dbt Model and then use the model with Reverse ETL.
Keep the following in mind as you set up the dbt extension:
To set up the dbt extension, you’ll need:
Follow these steps to connect the Git repository that stores your dbt Models:
After you’ve saved your setup, you can configure your Git repository’s settings to your needs by changing the repository, branch, dbt version, default schema, and project path.
You can also use dbt Cloud to schedule Reverse ETL syncs after a dbt Cloud job successfully runs.
To set up dbt Cloud:
Adding a custom subdomain
By default, dbt sets the subdomain to cloud. To identify your custom subdomain, open your URL and copy the portion before.getdbt.com. For example, if your domain washttps://subdomain.getdbt.com/, your subdomain would besubdomain.
The dbt Cloud integration allows you to schedule Reverse ETL syncs based on a dbt Cloud job.  When a dbt Cloud job is selected under the Reverse ETL scheduling section, Segment creates a webhook in the dbt Cloud account that will initiate to run the Reverse ETL sync when the job is scheduled.
In order to create the webhook, ensure that you have webhook permissions associated with the dbt Cloud token in the previous step.
After you set up dbt, Segment runs an initial sync to load models from your connected Git repository. This initial sync lets you use the most recent models when you set up Reverse ETL. In addition to Segment’s initial dbt sync, you can also trigger manual dbt model syncs.
After you’ve successfully set up dbt with a warehouse and connected to your Git repository, you can select dbt models for use with Reverse ETL by following these steps:
To change a connected model, ensure that you’ve removed it from all active Reverse ETL syncs.
Git Connections enable Segment to sync data with your preferred Git repository through supported like SSH and token-based authentication.
Git Sync and the dbt integration operate independently. You don’t need to set up Git Sync to use dbt, and dbt Cloud can trigger its own syncs without relying on Git Sync.
Segment supports the following credential types for setting up a Git Connection:
Segment lets you set up multiple Git Connections, allowing you to reuse credentials across both dbt and Git Sync. You can either use the same credential for multiple configurations or create separate Git Connections for each product and environment as needed.
If you plan to reuse a Git token across both dbt and Git Sync, ensure it has the necessary read and write permissions for both integrations.
CI check availability
CI checks are available only with the GitHub App connection.
CI checks in Segment help prevent breaking changes to active dbt models. Avoid changing dbt models currently in use with an active Reverse ETL sync, since changes could disrupt existing mappings and active syncs.
When CI checks are enabled, Segment monitors model changes in your Git repository. If a model already linked to an active Reverse ETL sync gets modified, Segment automatically rejects the change to maintain data integrity.
To enable CI Checks, authorize a GitHub App credential for your Git connection. Once connected, you can enable CI Checks in the dbt model sync configuration section.
The following table lists common dbt Extension errors, as well as their solutions:

Segment’s Git extension lets you manage versioning by syncing changes you make in your Segment workspace to a Git repository.
Git Sync supports one-way synchronization from Segment to Git. This sync captures the current state of your workspace through a full sync and includes all new records and changes for supported resources.
Segment doesn’t support syncing changes from Git back to Segment.
Follow these steps to set up Git Sync:
The Git sync extension syncs the following resources from Segment to your Git repository:
The Git sync extension doesn’t support the following resources:
Reach out toSegment supportto request support for additional Git Sync resources.
After you set up the Git sync extension for the first time, Segment performs an initial sync that sends the current state of your Segment workspace to the Git repository you connected. Segment automatically tracks all following workspace updates.
You can manually trigger syncs at any time by clickingFull Syncon the Git Sync page. To disable Git Sync from the Git Sync page, switch theEnabledtoggle to off.
Because a Segment workspace can represent a distinct environment (testing, staging, production), each workspace is mapped directly to a single Git repository. This direct mapping ensures a clear and organized relationship between workspace resources and a Git repository.
Segment uses itsTerraform providerto manage key functions like tracking changes and retrieving information about those changes in Segment. Segment stores changes in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), the format used by Terraform. To learn more about HCL and how it compares to JSON or YAML, visitHashiCorp’s HCL repository on GitHub.
Using HCL makes it easier to document Segment’s data model, especially for users managing versioning and Git Sync with Terraform. It also helps manage Segment configurations directly from Git. For more details on the Git Sync data model, readSegment’s Terraform provider documentation.
Segment supports one-way synchronization from Segment to Git, but you can set up two-way synchronization using the Segment Terraform provider.
Terraform offers an open-source way to manage Segment resources through a Git repository as an alternative to a fully managed two-way sync. This method requires third-party tools likeAtlantisfor CI integration.
To manage Segment resources using Git and Terraform, follow these steps:
Include the following provider configuration blocks:
For more information on using Terraform, visitTerraform’s documentation.
Git Connections enable Segment to sync data with your preferred Git repository through supported like SSH and token-based authentication.
Git Sync and the dbt integration operate independently. You don’t need to set up Git Sync to use dbt, and dbt Cloud can trigger its own syncs without relying on Git Sync.
Segment supports the following credential types for setting up a Git Connection:
Segment lets you set up multiple Git Connections, allowing you to reuse credentials across both dbt and Git Sync. You can either use the same credential for multiple configurations or create separate Git Connections for each product and environment as needed.
If you plan to reuse a Git token across both dbt and Git Sync, ensure it has the necessary read and write permissions for both integrations.
When setting up Git Sync, you may run into an access error with the following message:“Unable to create Git Sync due to Git connection issues. Please check your configuration and try again.
This error can occur if there are issues with your Git connection settings or permissions. To resolve the error, verify that:

Paragraphs:
Picking a strong password is one of the most important things you can do to protect your account.
Twilio Unified Login users can manage their password in their Twilio account
Twilio Unified Login users can manage their user settings, including name, email, password, and 2FA settings, directly in their Twilio account. To learn more about Twilio’s user and password policies, review Twilio’sAccount Managementdocumentation.
When you first create a Segment account, or when you reset or change the password of an existing account, you’ll see some tools which Segment uses to help you choose a strong password. Segment useszxcvbnto show your password strength, andHave I Been Pwnedto notify you if your password has been found in any data breaches. Your password is never stored in plaintext, and is securely stored using thebcryptpassword hashing function in Segment’s database.
Here are some general password guidelines:
Use a password manager like1PasswordorLastPassto generate and store passwords.
Passwords should be 8 or more characters. Consider using pass-phrases (for example,customer data infrastructure), combinations of random characters (for example,9;ske%t!u9jdckd#s>), or other strategies that are difficult to guess, such asicOnsTent CaPitaliZation.
Use a different password for every website. If you use the same password on multiple websites and one is breached, your accounts on all of these websites may be affected.
Do not share your password with anyone, even your co-workers. Once shared, they may use that password on another site or share it with another co-worker without telling you. If one of them leaves the company they will still be able to take actions under your account.
If you see a message that says “This password is known to have been previously compromised in a data breach”, it means that the password you typed has been used before, and was in a database that was compromised and put on the internet. This doesnotmean that Segment has been compromised, or that someone has accessed your Segment account. Check outHave I Been Pwnedfor more information, and choose a different password.

Paragraphs:
Before you can use your Segment account, you first need to verify your email address. We automatically send a verification message to the address you used to sign, but you can re-send the verification email if you didn’t receive it.
If a team member invited you to a Segment workspace, your email is automatically verified if you set up your account from the link in the invitation email.

You should receive a verification email from Segment within 20 minutes of signing up for a Segment account.
If you don’t receive the verification email, check out some of the suggestions below:
Typos: Check the spelling of your email address. If the spelling is incorrect, sign up again using the correct spelling of the address.
Spam or Junk Folder: Check your Spam or Junk folder. Verification emails may be filtered directly into your email provider’s spam or junk mail folder. Your ISP or corporate domain may be configured to deliver commercial mail to this folder by default.
Web Browser Needs a Refresh: Try requesting another verification email, and refresh the page of your email web browser.
Blocked or Bounced Address: If you tried to verify a specific email address but did not receive the verification email, your ISP or corporate domain may have blocked the email. If you haven’t receivedanySegment emails, try verifying an alternative email address or get help.
Role, Group, or Alias Address: Some role addresses can be verified, but many can’t, because more than one person may have access to a role email address (such asadminordev-opsemails). You should use a personal email address for your contact and billing address.

Paragraphs:
The Public API is available to customers on Team or Business plans.See theavailable plans, orcontact Support.
On this page
The Segment Public API helps you manage your Segment workspaces and its resources. You can use the API to perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations at no extra charge. This includes working with resources such as Sources, Destinations, Warehouses, Tracking Plans, and the Segment Destinations and Sources Catalogs. The Public API is available to Team and Business Tier customers.
All CRUD endpoints in the API follow REST conventions and use standard HTTP methods. Different URL endpoints represent different resources in a workspace.
Research and test the Public API's available endpoints.
If your application is built in Javascript / Typescript, Go, Java, or Swift, check outSegment’s Public API SDKs.
The Public API includes the following benefits over the Config API:
Only Workspace Owners can create a Public API token
Only users with the Workspace Owner role can create a Public API token. For more information about roles, see Segment’sRolesdocumentation.
To create a Public API token in your Segment workspace:
To begin sending requests to the Public API, make sure to include the Public API Token into your HTTP requests with theAuthorizationHeader and configured withBearer Tokenand the value of the newly generated Public API token.
To enhance API token security, Segment partners with GitHub to prevent fraudulent use of exposed API tokens found in public git repositories. This helps to prevent malicious actors from using exposed tokens to perform unauthorized actions in your Segment workspace.
Within seconds, GitHub scans each commit in public repositories for Public API tokens, and sends detected tokens to Segment. Valid tokens are automatically revoked and workspace owners are notified.
Learn more aboutGitHub’s secret scanning program.
In most cases, identifying and revoking an exposed token takes seconds. Segment recommends you check theaudit trailto ensure no unauthorized actions were taken with the token.
Developers can accidentally commit tokens to public repositories, exposing them to the public. This can happen when developers use a token in a local development environment and forget to remove it before committing their code.
By automatically revoking the exposed token, Segment helps keep your workspace secure and prevents potential abuse of the token.
This feature is automatically enabled for all workspaces on Team or Business tier plans.
If you see a CORS error, this means you’re attempting to make a request to the Public API on the front-end. The Public API is used for server-side only. To get rid of the error, move all Public API requests to a server.
Onlyusers that have aWorkspace Ownerrolecan create Public API Tokens.
When you don’t have a source to forward violations or blocked events to, then exclude the fieldsforwardingViolationsToorforwardingBlockedEventsToentirely from the request and the setting will be disabled.
PATCHendpoint :https://api.segmentapis.com/sources/{sourceId}/settings
The destination’s Instance ID is specific to a single destination within your workspace. The destination’s Meta ID, which is returned by the delivery metrics endpoint, identifies which integration you’ve set up. For example, if you had adevMixpanel (Actions) destination and aprodMixpanel (Actions) destination, they would have the same Meta ID but two different Instance IDs.

The Segment Public API is available
Segment’sPublic APIis available for Team and Business tier customers to use. You can use the Public API and Config APIs in parallel, but moving forward any API updates will come to the Public API exclusively.
Please contact your account team orfriends@segment.comwith any questions.
This reference provides a comprehensive overview of the Segment Destination Filter query language. For information on the Destination Filters API (including information on migrating from the Config API), visit theDestination Filters API reference.
TheTransformations APIuses Filter Query Language (FQL) to filter JSON objects and conditionally apply transformations. You can use FQL statements to:
In addition to boolean and equality operators likeandand>=, FQL has built-in functions that make it more powerful such ascontains( str, substr )andmatch( str, pattern ).
Given the following JSON object:
The following FQL statements will evaluate as follows:
FQL statements may refer to any field in the JSON object including top-level
properties likeuserIdoreventas well as nested properties likecontext.library.versionorproperties.titleusing dot-separated paths. For
example, the following fields can be pointed to by the associated field paths:
If your field name has a character not in the set of{a-z A-Z 0-9 _ -}, you must escape it using a\character. For example, the nested field below can be referred to byproperties.product\ 1.price:
You can use parentheses to group subexpressions for more complex “and / or” logic as long as the subexpression evaluates to true or false:
Functions handlenullwith sensible defaults to make writing FQL more concise.
For example, you can writelength( userId ) > 0instead oftypeof( userId ) =
'string' and length( userId ) > 0.
Thematch( string, pattern )function uses “glob” matching to returntrueif the given string fully matches a given pattern. Glob patterns are case sensitive. If you only need to determine if a string contains another string, you should usecontains().
If your FQL statement is invalid (for exampleuserId = oops"), your Segment event will not be sent on to downstream Destinations. Segment defaults to not sending the event to ensure that invalid FQL doesn’t cause sensitive information like PII to be incorrectly sent to Destinations.
For this reason, Segment recommends that you use the Destination Filters “Preview” API to test your filters without impacting your production data.

Segment’s query language lets you define audience segments and computed traits. With clear syntax and practical functionality, the language simplifies the process of defining conditions and computations, helping you extract valuable insights from customer data.
This reference provides a comprehensive overview of the Segment query language.
Segment's query language in private beta
Segment’s query language is in private beta, and Segment is actively working on this feature. Some functionality may change before it becomes generally available.
Audience definitions specify the criteria for identifying users or accounts as members of a particular audience, while computed trait definitions outline the logic for aggregating or calculating values stored as traits on user or account level profiles.
With Segment’s query language, you can create these definitions and use them with Segment APIs to generate audiences and computed traits.
This section outlines the functions and operators you can use with the query language.
Follow these syntax rules when you create definitions:
The language supports the following syntactic sugar adjustments:
The definition type (USERSorACCOUNTS) determines whether the computation operates at the user or account level. For account-level audiences, you can apply additional functionsANY(to verify that all underlying users meet the defined conditions) andALL(to check if any of the underlying users meet the defined conditions).
These functions use the association between accounts and users to determine audience membership.
The following tables list the query languages’s available functions.
Suppose you wanted to collect all users who performed theShoes Boughtevent at least once within the last seven days, where the purchase price was greater than or equal to 100.
Another way to think of this scenario would be:
Here’s how you could do that in Segment’s query language:
This example collects:
This example collects all users who did not perform theShoes Boughtevent at least once and don’t have atotal_spendtrait with a value greater than200:
This example collects all accounts where all associated users performed theShoes Boughtevent at least once and have atotal_spendtrait greater than200:
This example collects all accounts where no associated users performed theShoes Boughtevent at least once:
This example collects all accounts where any associated users performed theShoes Boughtevent at least once:
Suppose you wanted to calculate the average spend based on allShoes Boughtevents performed within the last 30 days for each user.
Another way to think of this would be:
Here’s how you could do that in Segment’s query language:
This example calculates the minimum spend for each user, based on allShoes Boughtevents, where the price was greater than100and the brand wasMy_Brand:
This example calculates the first-seen spend value for each user, based on allShoes Boughtevents performed within the last 30 days:
This example calculates the most frequent spend value for each user, based on allShoes Boughtevents performed within the last 30 days. It only considers spend values that have a minimum frequency of2:

Segment’sPublic APIis available for Team and Business tier customers to use. You can use the Public API and Config APIs in parallel, but moving forward any API updates will come to the Public API exclusively.
Please contact your account team orfriends@segment.comwith any questions.
The Config API enables you to programmatically manage Segment workspaces, sources, destinations and more. With the API you can:
The Config API is a set of REST services under segmentapis.com:
To see all the API methods and models see theSegment Config API Reference.
At this time there are no language-specific clients. However theAPI Referencealso contains example code snippets for cURL, Go, Node, Python and more.
You can interact with the API from the command line. First install thecurltool.
You can use the Config API with an access token to programmatically access Segment resources that the token can access. Access tokens are created by workspace owners using the Access Management page, and can only access resources that the token has permission to.
These are currently only suitable for first party, trusted applications, such as your personal local scripts and server side programs. Partners should not prompt Segment users for their username and password and save an access token as a way to delegate access. See theAuthenticationdoc for more information.
When you create an access token, you’ll give it a description, a workspace, and determine whether it has workspace owner or member access.
Secret Token
You can not retrieve the plain-texttokenlater, so you should save it in a secret manager. If you lose thetokenyou can generate a new one.
info
As of February 1, 2024, new Config API tokens cannot be created in the app as Segment moves toward exclusive support for thePublic API.Migrate your implementation to the Public APIto access the latest features and available endpoints. To create a new Config API token, reach out to friends@segment.com for support.
Now that you have an access token, you can use this token to access the rest of the Config API by setting it in theAuthorizationheader of your requests, for example:

The Segment Public API is available
Segment’sPublic APIis available for Team and Business tier customers to use. You can use the Public API and Config APIs in parallel, but moving forward any API updates will come to the Public API exclusively.
Please contact your account team orfriends@segment.comwith any questions.
Segment strives to maintain a strict contract around the stability of our APIs once they reach maturity.
The Config API is versioned statically by path prefix. The current version,/v1beta, is stable and suitable for production use, but not 100% mature. We will not ship any backwards incompatible breaking changes after its public launch on December 12, 2018. However, we may release new versions of the API as further/v1betaXreleases or as major version releases (such as/v1).
The reason the path is currently/v1betais to signify both that Segment’s product model is evolving and that we are looking for feedback from developers on how best to expose that model for public consumption, extension, and automation.
Therefore,/v1betais subject to deprecation with 3 months of written notice after the release of/v1, should we decide to land any breaking changes in the final/v1release.
We’re always actively seeking feedback on the ergonomics and breadth of our APIs. If you have ideas of how we can improve them that you’d like to see as extensions to/v1betaor considered for changes in/v1, don’t hesitate toget in touch.
The Config API is a set of REST APIs for managing Segment resources. The primary Segment resources are:
You can manage each resource using standard methods:
The List method is paginated. Requests take an optionalpage_sizeparameter which generally defaults to 10 or 100 items. If there are more thanpage_sizeitems in a collection, the response includes anext_page_tokenfield. You can then supply this aspage_tokenparameter to the next List request. If there are no more items in the collection,next_page_tokenwill be empty.
Update methods follow PATCH semantics. In addition to the data to update, the method requires an explicit set of field names to update. This removes all ambiguity around empty values.
Note that specifying an update path with no value will change the field to an empty value (e.g. “”, 0, or false). For example this will result inenabledfalse:
And note that specifying data but no paths will not change the field value. For example this has no effect:
Resources are named entities exposed by our services and APIs, and resource names are their identifiers. Each resource has its own unique resource name made up of the ID or slug of the resource itself and the IDs or slugs of any parent resources.
So a given Source resource might look like:
workspaces/<customer-workspace-slug>/sources/<customer-source-slug>
Segment APIs use scheme-less URIs for resource names. This allows us to generally follow REST URL conventions and provides a machine and human-legible standard for our identifiers.
Segment favors “slugs” over opaque IDs when the resource is customer- or Segment-named and unlikely to change, such as sources and destinations. For resources whose name is subject to change frequently, such as Tracking Plans, we will autogenerate prefixed IDs for you upon creation and use that in the fully qualified resource name.
While full resource names resemble normal URLs, they are not the same thing. A single resource may be exposed by different API versions, API protocols, or API network endpoints as Segment’s APIs evolve.

Please contact your account team orfriends@segment.comwith any questions.
You can access the Config API programmatically using access tokens. When you authenticate with an access token, you have access to any resource and permission assigned to the token.
As a workspace owner, you can create access tokens from the Access Management page in Admin settings. You can assign the same granularity of permissions as you can for a logged-in user. As best practice, tokens should be assigned the least permissions needed to perform a required API action. All tokens must have a description.

Welcome! Here are the steps you’ll follow to build an integration on Dev Center 2.0, launch your destination to Private Beta so customers can test it, and then launch it as Public in the Segment catalog.
Over 19,000 companies use Segment as their central hub for collecting and synthesizing first-party customer data. Customers use Segmentsourcesto collect data across all their properties (for example, web, mobile, CRMs, or email) and send this data intodestinations(SaaS tools, internal databases or queues, or a data warehouse) to perform analytics, run marketing campaigns and much more.
Segment provides two different integration types to support bringing your data into Segment, and sending your data downstream to other third-party tools.
Sourcesbring users’ first-party data into Segment. While there are severaltypesof sources (for example, web or server libraries, mobile integrations, and Cloud), the Developer Center enables you to build your ownCloud Eventsources. These sources enable users to import data directly from your application into Segment.
Destinationssend data to other tools for processing or analysis. For example, a Segment user may want to send their data to your advertising platform or analytics tool. To accomplish this, they’ll connect your Segment destination to their workspace.
All new Segment Destinations are built on theActions framework, which enables a simplified build experience for you and a more straightforward configuration experience for your users.
To develop your integration in the Developer Center, complete the following steps:
Sign up for theSegment Select Partner Program. During the sign-up process, you’ll agree to theSegment Partner Program AgreementandPrivacy Policy.
Segment’sConceptual Modelis a high-level overview of how Segment works and explains how your integration fits into the Segment catalog.
TheSegment Specprovides best practices for the specific data you should capture and the best way to format that data based on your use case. The Spec outlines the semantic definition of the customer data that Segment captures across all its libraries and APIs, and will be a main building block for your integration.

Paragraphs:

The Segment Javascript library wrapper, which makes it simple to send your data to any tool without having to learn, test or implement the new API for each tool every time.
Application Programming Interface. In software, this term describes a way of interacting with software in an automated fashion, without the use of a user-interface designed for humans. In Segment, we call the standard calls (track,pageandscreen,identifyandgroup) our API. We also provide thePublic API, which you can use to configure sources and destinations, and perform other functions in your workspace, without logging in using a web browser.
The app is what we call the main Segment web application, the part you log in to, and where you configure sources and destinations, see events in the debugger, manage your tracking plan, and so on.
Asynchronous means occurring without a specific order or sequence. In engineering, it’s most often used for things like when you have to ask a server for a piece of information. If that was a synchronous task, while you were waiting for the server to respond you wouldn’t be able to do anything else, you’d just be stuck waiting. But since it’s asynchronous, you can request information from a server, continue to go do a bunch of other tasks, and then when the server responds you can get back to what you were doing to start. Basically it lets you work on multiple things at once (in parallel) instead of needing to finish everything in the order it comes in. Think of it like one of the ways computers are able to multi-task.
Personas Audiencesallow you to define cohorts of users or accounts based on their event behavior and traits that Segment then keeps up-to-date over time. Audiences can be built from your core tracking events, traits, or computed traits. These audiences can then be synced to hundreds of destinations or available using the Profile API.
Amazon Web Services, a large cloud service provider.
Segment’s list of available sources, destinations, and warehouses. You can access the catalog from theSegment website, and from inside the Segment app.
Content Delivery Network. CDNs are a network of servers which make downloading files faster for the user, by placing them all around the world to reduce data transit time. When you have servers in a CDN, they’re much closer on average to the end user. If someone is using Segment in Asia, they don’t have to download our files all the way from California, they can get them from a server much closer to them in the network.
Customer Data Platform: a central platform that brokers the flow of customer data through their application infrastructure so that they can build a central understanding of each customer’s interactions, comply with regulations that require them to carefully manage customer data, and ensure that their interactions with the customer are optimized.
Cookies are small pieces of text that are stored by the browser on a website. Cookies have anameand avalue. They may also be set from Javascript usingdocument.cookie. Our analytics.js script sets up a cookie calledajs_uidto store the user’s id.
Every time you make a request to a website, you send along the cookies that you have stored. It’s how the website figures out who you should be logged in as. You can think of it sort of like a passport as a form of ID. When you first enter your username and password, the website generates a secure cookie, and tells your browser to store it. From then on, your browser sends along the cookie as a way of identifying yourself to the website.
This refers to a group of libraries that can send data to Segment and which sendDevice-modedata. The term “client side” is usually used in contrast toServer Side.
Cloud mode, (orServer-side) libraries send data to Segment, where it’s then sent on to destinations. Usually used in contrast toDevice modelibraries, which send the data directly to the destination’s API endpoints.
Cloud mode librariesrun on a server and are completely invisible to end users. You can find the full list of server-side languages Segment supportsin the Sources catalog. These libraries can be used to track a user in realtime as they use your app, but are also able to run batches of calls to update many end users at once. Cloud-mode libraries do not maintain “state” which means every API call you make must include every detail you want to see inside of Segment.
Computed traitsare per-user or per-accounttraitsthat you create or “compute” in Segment. When you build a computed trait, Segment adds it to relevant user profiles.
Custom traitsare user or account traits collected from the Identify calls you send to Segment.  For example, you can add any trait that you send as a part of your Identify calls (email,first_name,last_name) as custom traits. You can then view them in the Profile explorer, and use them in your audiences, computed traits, and SQL traits.
This is the place in the app where you can see your events flowing through Segment.
A destination is a target for Segment to forward data to, and represents a tool or storage destination.
Device mode, (orclient-side) libraries are loaded on the on the user’s client (for example their web browser, or mobile device), which means they can collect contextual data about the user. The three main libraries that are considered “device mode” areAnalytics.js, which is used on websites, ouriOS SDK, and ourAndroid SDK. Device mode libraries can maintain a cache of information about each user on the device so we know that device belongs to a consistentanonymousIdoruserId, and has a consistent list of traits like name, email, etc.
Data management platform
Demand-side platform
Extract, Transform and Load. Referring to the process of extracting data from a production system, transforming it with enriching data into a new format, and then loading it into a data warehouse for analysis (a separate database from production).
An event can refer to either an action by a user, or something a user does which triggers atrack call. Events have a name (for example “Product viewed”) and properties (for example the product name, price, and category), and take place in a single moment in time. (This is in contrast to “objects” which persist over a period of time, and which have properties that might change.)
A call that gathers information about who the user is.
JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a convenient format for storing structured data.
A library is a reusable piece of code which acts as a building block for higher level pieces of code. It’s the software equivalent of a ‘tool’. For instance, take Instagram filters. In the good old days, to take a picture with an interesting filter, you had to adjust the aperture length, the focal length, the exposure and film speed to get the desired effect. But now, you can just use Instagram, and press a button to get the pre-tuned filter that you want. They’ve packaged those effects in software and made them re-usable.
The most common use case for this term at Segment is in reference to the libraries people use to send data to our API.A full list of libraries can be found in our docs. Libraries can collect either in “Device mode” or “Cloud mode”.
A “lookback window” limits the period of time in which data is considered when calculating a trait or audience. For example, you might set a lookback window of 7 days on an audience or trait likenew_users_7_days, but you would not add a lookback window to a trait that isn’t time-bounded, such aslifetime_value.
A method is programming speak for “an action an object can take”. It’s a specific type of function that is attached to an object. All of our analytics tracking libraries createanalyticsobjects, and thentrack,identify,page,etcare methods you can invoke on those objects.
Monthly Tracked Users. You can find more about how they are calculatedherebut in short, they are calculated by adding the number unique userIds and number of unique anonymousIds that a customer tracks with Segment.
An object is a type of data that persists over time and can be updated, for example a Business or a User record. Objects have “traits” which record information about that object, and which can change over time. For example a “user” object could have a trait of “email” which doesn’t change often, but could also have acomputed traitlikelogged_in_last_7_days. (Objects are in contrast to “events” which happen at a single moment in time, and whose properties do not change.)
Over the top (OTT) refers to content providers that distribute streaming media as a standalone product directly to viewers over the Internet, bypassing telecommunications, multichannel television, and broadcast television platforms that traditionally act as a controller or distributor of such content.
The Segment API call records that a user “viewed a page”. It’s recorded by callinganalytics.page(). You can optionally pass in anameand acategory.
An open-sourceSQLserver.
An analytics data warehouse from Amazon Web Services. Made for loading in tons of event data, and then analyzing it with complex queries. It’s designed to be fast and cheap.
How often we attempt to redeliver a payload before marking it as failed.
The ability to re-send your user data to new destinations and tools.
A schema is a word used to refer to the design of a database, including what fields there are, and what data types each one contains. If you were to think of a database as a spreadsheet, the schema would be the top row with the field labels, plus the data types and formatting rules for each column.
In Segment, you can send data to a Warehouse which has a schema based on the types of data you collect and route through Segment, and which updates as the data you collect changes.
Refers to a group of libraries that can send data to Segment, inCloud mode, meaning through the Segment cloud. “Server side” can could refer to people sending data directly toour HTTP APIwithout using a “library”. Usually used in contrast toClient Side.
Software Development Kit. This is a combination of libraries and used mostly in the context of building mobile or native apps.
(pronounced ‘sequel’)
Structured Query Language. The standard language for retrieving information from a database. It’s often called “relational” because all the queries are related to relations between the data. For instance, find me all users who are named “Alice” would translate to…
SQL traitsare per-user or per-account traits that you create by running queries against your data warehouse, which can include data not captured using your Segment implementation. Segment imports the results into Personas, and appends these traits to the user profile.
A website, server library, mobile SDK, or cloud application which can send data into Segment.
Short for “Specification”, the Segment Spec is our set of recommendations for what data to collect and how to format it.
Supply-side Platform
The number of API calls and Objects your account makes, per MTU. The limit on this number is defined by your account plan.
Type of API call (method) which records any actions that users perform on a web or mobile app.
A tracking plan is a tool that our customers use to keep track of their analytics setup. It contains all of the events, pages, traits and properties they want to record with information about how each is laid out. It’s often in a spreadsheet or document, but we’re actually building the functionality into the core product so that people can plan out their tracking setup right from inside Segment.
Traits are individual pieces of information that we know about anobject. Objects persist over time, so traits can change over time.
Segment’s Data warehouse product. All event data can be sent to one of several Warehouses, where your team can use it to perform more complex analysis of the data.

Flagship libraries offer the most up-to-date functionality on Segment’s most popular platforms. Segment actively maintains flagship libraries, which benefit from new feature releases and ongoing development and support.
On this page
Analytics.js enables you to send your data to hundreds ofdestination toolswithout having to learn, test, or use a new API every time.
Segment’s Analytics.js library is fully open-source and can be viewed onGitHub.
Use theAnalytics.js QuickStart Guideto learn how to add Analytics.js to your site. Once you’ve installed the library, read on for the detailed API reference.
Analytics.js provides two key benefits over the previous version.
Analytics.js reduces page load time and improves site performance. Its package size is~70%smaller than its predecessor, the classic version of Analytics.js.
Many factors impact page load time, including network conditions, hosting locations, and page weight. Page weight for each customer integration varies based on the number of device-mode destinations that are enabled for each source. The more device-mode destinations that are enabled, the more data gets added to the library, which will impact the weight of the library.
Analytics.js improves developer experience by introducing new ways for developers to augment events throughout the event timeline. For example, developers can augment events either before or after an event occurs, or while the event is in-flight.
For example, you can use Analytics.js to build features that:
The basic tracking methods below serve as the building blocks of your Segment tracking. They includeIdentify,Track,Page,Group, andAlias.
These methods correspond with those used in theSegment Spec. The documentation on this page explains how to use these methods in Analytics.js.
Good to know
For any of the methods described in this page, you can replace the properties in the code samples with variables that represent the data collected.
Use theidentifymethod to link your users and their actions, to a recognizableuserIdandtraits. You can seeanidentifyexample in the Quickstart guideorfind details on the identify method payload.
`identify` and anonymous visitors
Segment recommendsagainstusingidentifyfor anonymous visitors to your site. Analytics.js automatically retrieves ananonymousIdfromlocalStorageor assigns one for new visitors, and then attaches it to allpageandtrackevents both before and after anidentify.
The Identify method follows the format below:
The Identify call has the following fields:
By default, Analytics.js caches traits in the browser’slocalStorageand attaches them to each Identify call.
For example, you might call Identify when someone signs up for a newsletter but hasn’t yet created an account on your site. The example below shows an Identify call (using hard-coded traits) that you might send in this case.
Then, when the user completes the sign up process, you might see the following:
The traits object for the second call also includesnickname,favoriteCompiler, andindustry.
You may omit both traits and options, and pass the callback as the second argument.
The Track method lets you record actions your users perform. You cansee a track example in the Quickstart guideor find details onthe track method payload.
The Track method follows the format below:
Thetrackcall has the following fields:
The only required argument in Analytics.js is anevent name string. You can read more abouthow Segment recommends you name events.
Example Track call:
For more information about choosing which events to track, event naming, and more, check outAnalytics Academy.
The only required argument on Track calls in Analytics.js is aneventname string. Read more about how Segment recommendsnaming your events.
trackLinkis a helper method that attaches thetrackcall as a handler to a link.
WithtrackLink, Analytics.js inserts a timeout of 300 ms to give thetrackcall more time. This is useful when a page would redirect before thetrackmethod could complete all requests.
ThetrackLinkmethod follows the format below.
Example:
trackFormis a helper method that binds atrackcall to a form submission.
ThetrackFormmethod inserts a timeout of 300 ms to give thetrackcall more time to complete. This is useful to prevent a page from redirecting before thetrackmethod could complete all requests.
ThetrackFormmethod follows the format below.
Example:
ThePagemethod lets you record page views on your website, along with optional extra information about the page viewed by the user.
Because some Destinations require apagecall to instantiate their libraries,you must callpageat least once per page load. You can call it more than once if needed, for example, on virtual page changes in a single page app.
See the implementation guide for more information aboutcalling the Page method.
Analytics.js includes a Page call by default as the final line inthe Analytics.js snippet. You can update thispagecall within the guidelines below.
Thepagemethod follows the format below.
Thepagecall has the following fields:
Analytics.js adds properties to eachpagecall.
Segment adds the following information:
You can override these values by explicitly setting them in your calls. For example:
Translates to:
Segment sets thepathandurlproperty to the value of the canonical element on your page. If a canonical element is not set, the values will be set from the browser.
The Group method associates anidentified userwith a company, organization, project, workspace, team, tribe, platoon, assemblage, cluster, troop, gang, party, society or any other collective noun you come up with for the same concept.
This is useful fortools likeIntercom,Preact, andTotango, as it ties the user to agroupof other users.
The Group method follows the format below.
The Group call has the following fields:
Examplegroupcall:
By default, Analytics.js caches grouptraitsin the browser’s local storage and attaches them to eachgroupcall, similar to how theidentifymethod works.
Find more details aboutgroup, including thegrouppayload, inthe Group Spec.
The Alias method combines two unassociated user identities. Segment usually handles aliasing automatically when you callidentifyon a user, however some tools require an explicitaliascall.
This is an advanced method, but it’s required to manage user identities successfully insomeSegment destinations likeKissmetricsandMixpanel.
The Alias method follows the format below:
The Alias call has the following fields:
For more details about Alias, including thealiascall payload, check out theSegment Spec.
The Analytics.js utility methods help you change how Segment loads on your page. They include:
Theloadmethod is also available when you load analytics.js through theNPM package.
You can load a buffered version of analytics.js that requires you to callloadexplicitly before analytics.js initiates any network activity. This is useful if you want to, for example, wait for user consent before you fetch tracking destinations or send buffered events to Segment.
Callloadone time only.
You can also useloadif you fetch some settings asynchronously.
Thereadymethod lets you pass in a method that gets called after Analytics.js finishes initializing and after all enabled device-mode destinations load. It’s likejQuery’sreadymethod, except for Destinations. Because it doesn’t fire until all enabled device-mode destinations are loaded, it can’t be used to change configuration options for downstream SDKs. That can only be done if the SDK is loaded natively.
Thereadymethod isn’t invoked if any Destination throws an error (for example, for an expired API key, incorrect settings configuration, or when a Destination is blocked by the browser) during initialization. If you want to check when Analytics.js has loaded, you can look at the value ofwindow.analytics.initialized. When it’s true, the library has successfully initialized, even if some destinations are blocked.
Note:window.analytics.initializedis a simple boolean, not an event or a pub/sub system. This means you can’t subscribe to changes in its value. If you need to detect when it changes fromfalsetotrue, you must set up a polling mechanism to monitor the value.
The code in thereadyfunction only executes afterreadyis emitted.
If you want to access end-tool library methods that do not match any Analytics.js methods, like adding an extra setting to Mixpanel, you can use areadycallback so that you’re guaranteed to have access to the Mixpanel object, like so:
Thereadymethod uses the following format:
Thereadymethod has the following fields:
Calling thedebugmethod turns on debug mode, which logs helpful messages to the console. Subsequent Segment events generate messages in the developer console after you invokedebug.
Enable:
Disable:
The globalanalyticsobject emits events whenever you callalias,group,identify,track, orpage.
Use theonmethod to set listeners for these events and run your own custom code. This can be useful if you want to send data to a service for which Segment doesn’t have a destination.
Example:
This method emits eventsbeforethey are processed by the Segment integration, and may not include some of the normalization Segment performs on the client before sending the data to the Segment servers.
Note
Page event properties are stored in theoptionsobject.
Thetimeoutmethod sets the length (in milliseconds) of callbacks and helper functions. This is useful if you have multiple scripts that need to fire in your callback ortrackLink,trackFormhelper function.
The example below sets the timeout to 500 ms.
If you’re triggering ad network conversion pixels, Segment recommends extending timeout to 500 ms to account for slow load times.
Callingresetresets theid, includinganonymousId, and clearstraitsfor the currently identified user and group.
Theresetmethod only clears the cookies andlocalStoragecreated by Segment. It doesn’t clear data from other integrated tools, as those native libraries might set their own cookies to manage user tracking, sessions, and manage state. To completely clear out the user session, see the documentation provided by those tools.
Segment doesn’t sharelocalStorageacross subdomains. If you use Segment tracking on multiple subdomains, you must callanalytics.reset()for each subdomain to completely clear out the user session.
You can utilize this in instances where an API call fires on a hard redirect, and are missed from getting captured in Segment. If you set this flag to true, it enables firing the event before the redirect. This is available for all events. You can read more about this in theGithub PR.
Tip: You can change how your data flows in several different ways without having to change your code. SeeFiltering Datato learn more.
You can pass anintegrationsobject in theoptionsof Alias, Group, Identify, Page, and Trackmethods to send data to only the selected destinations. By default, all Destinations are enabled.
The example below sends a message only to Intercom and Google Analytics.
'All': falsetells Segment not to send data toanyDestinations by default, unless they’re explicitly listed astruein the next lines.
As an opposite example, the snippet below sends a message to all integrationsexceptIntercom and Google Analytics.
You don’t need to include'All': truein this call because it’s implied as the default behavior. Instead, only list the destinations that you want to exclude, with afalseflag for each.
Destination flags arecase sensitiveand matchthe destination’s name in the docs(for example, “AdLearn Open Platform”, “awe.sm”, “Mailchimp”, etc). If a Destination has more than one acceptable name, this appears in the documentation for that destination.
Business tier customers can filter Track calls from the Source Schema page in the Segment UI. Segment recommends that you use the UI to simplify filter management and make updates without changing your site’s code.
Note:To use this feature, you must be on snippet version 4.1.0 or later. You can get the latest version of the snippet from theAnalytics.js Quickstart.
You can modify the.loadmethod in Analytics.js (the second line of the snippet) to take a second argument. If you pass an object with anintegrationsdictionary, then Segment only loads the integrations in that dictionary that are marked as enabled with the boolean valuetrue.
You can only call.loadon page load, or reload (refresh). If you modify the.loadmethod between page loads, it doesn’t have any effect until the page is reloaded.
For example:
This way, you can conditionally load integrations based on what customers opt into on your site. The example below shows how you might load only the tools that the user agreed to use.
You can also add anobfuscateproperty to the object in the second parameter, which obscures the URL from which your integrations and destination actions are loaded. This helps prevent words that are flagged by ad blockers to not be detected in your URL, enabling the integration to properly load.
For example:
Theobfuscatevalue isfalseby default.
By default, the Analytics.js library will convert ISO8061 strings to a Date object before passing it to downstream device-mode integrations. If you would like to disable this functionality and send those strings as they are passed to the event, you can use the load method to pass in thedisableAutoISOConversionoption.
For example:
SomeuserAgentstrings are frozen and contain less information. If you would like to request more information when it’s available, you can pass an array of strings with fields you would like to request to thehighEntropyValuesClientHintsoption. The example array below contains all possible values.
For example:
For testing or staging environments, it can be useful to disable your SDK to ensure no events send.
Ifdisable: trueis passed, all analytics method calls will be a no-op, and no network calls will be initiated.
For wrapper/plugin authors: if you have a use case where you need special access to the CDN Settings (for example, consent management), you can also pass a function. This API waits forcdnSettingsto be fetched. Keep in mind thatcdnSettingsis anunstableobject.
When enabled, Analytics.js automatically retries network and server errors. With persistent retries, Analytics.js can:
Analytics.js stores events inlocalStorageand falls back to in-memory storage whenlocalStorageis unavailable. It retries up to 10 times with an incrementally increasing back-off time between each retry. Analytics.js queues up to 100 events at a time to avoid using too much of the device’s local storage. See thedestination Retries documentationto learn more.
Batching is the ability to group multiple requests or calls into one request or API call. All requests sent within the same batch have the samereceivedAttime. With Analytics.js, you can send events to Segment in batches. Sending events in batches enables you to have:
You can start batching by changing thestrategyto"batching"and the parameters forsizeandtimeoutwithin theloadmethod in the analytics object. Batching requires both parameters.
You can check to see if batching works by checking your source’s debugger inSources > Debugger. When you select an event and view theRawcode, thereceivedAttime of all the events in the batch should be the same.
The batch size is the threshold that forces all batched events to be sent once it’s reached. For example,size: 10means that after triggering 10 events, Analytics.js sends those 10 events together as a batch to Segment.
Your total batched events can’t exceed the maximum payload size of 500 KB, with a limit of 32 KB for each event in the batch. If the 500 KB limit is reached, the batch will be split.
timeoutis the number of milliseconds that forces all events queued for batching to be sent, regardless of the batch size, once it’s reached. For example,timeout: 5000sends every event in the batch to Segment once 5 seconds passes.
Analytics.js does its best to deliver the queued events before the browser closes, but the delivery isn’t guaranteed.
Upon receiving thebeforeunloadbrowser event, Analytics.js attempts to flush the queue usingfetchrequests withkeepaliveset to true. Since the max size ofkeepalivepayloads is limited to 64 KB, if the queue size is bigger than 64 KB at the time the browser closes, then there is a chance of losing a subset of the queued events. Reducing the batch size or timeout will alleviate this issue, but that will be a trade-off decision.
No, this batching only impacts events sent to Segment. Once the batch reaches Segment, it’s split up and follows the normal path of an event.
No, batching won’t impact billing or throughput.
Partner integrations don’t support batching as all other partner integrations run one event at a time. Only Segment.io events support batched delivery.
Batching won’t work on Internet Explorer.
Batching delays retries, as events that are queued for batching aren’t retried until a batch delivery fails.
No, there is no change in behavior to Middlewares.
No, there is no impact to how events filter.
When you develop against Analytics 2.0, the plugins you write can augment functionality, enrich data, and control the flow and delivery of events. From modifying event payloads to changing analytics functionality, plugins and middleware help to speed up the process of getting things done.
Plugins and source middleware accomplish the same thing, but plugins are significantly more powerful (but more verbose to implement).
For basic use cases like adding event fields or dropping specific events, usesource middleware. If you need more granular control of the lifecycle, or want to be able to abort the Segment initialization, you should useplugins.
Source middlewareruns before any other plugins. You can use this to enrich or drop an event.
Here are some examples of usingaddSourceMiddlewarefor enrichment and validation.
For advanced modification to the event pipeline.
Here’s an example of a plugin that converts all track event names to lowercase before the event goes through the rest of the pipeline:
Here’s an example of autilityplugin that allows you to change the format of the anonymous_id cookie:
You can view Segment’sexisting pluginsto see more examples.
Registering plugins enable you to modify your analytics implementation to best fit your needs. You can register a plugin using this:
Segment offers video player ‘plugins’ so you can quickly collect video events using Analytics.js. See the specific documentation below to learn more:
Analytics.js tracks across subdomains out of the box. All Segment destinations fully support this feature.
To track activity on your subdomains, include the Segment Analytics.js snippet on each subdomain. Segment sets users’anonymousIdon the top-level domain, so that users are tracked across any subdomain.
Because Segment tracks across subdomains, you can either use the same Segment source, or use separate sources for each subdomain. What you decide depends on your team’s goals for tracking each subdomain.
Segment doesn’t offer tracking across top-level domains out of the box. If you want to track across top-level domains, you can utilize Segment’sQuerystring APIto pass the anonymousId from Website A to Website B in the query string. When a user moves from Website A to Website B with the anonymousId in the query string, Analytics.js reads that value and sets the anonymousId to it, rather than generating a new one.
UTM parameters are only used when linking to your site from outside your domain. When a visitor arrives using a link containing UTM parameters, Segment’s analytics.js library will parse the URL query string and add the information to the event payload. For more information about UTM tracking, see theTracking Customers Across Channels and Devicesdocumentation.
UTM parameters contain three essential components (utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign) and two optional (utm_content, utm_term). For example, if you include the following three parameters in your URL:?utm_source=mysource&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=mytestcampaign, once a visitor arrives using a link containing the above, Segment automatically grabs the UTM parameters and subsequent events will contain these parameters within the ‘context’ object (visible in the raw view of your Source Debugger.)
So, for example, if somebody follows the link with above query string to your site, the subsequent ‘page’ call in your Debugger should contain the below and will be passed to any enabled destinations:
Whenever the UTM parameters are no longer a part of the URL, Segment no longer includes them. For example, if the user goes to a new page within your website which does not contain these parameters, they will not be included in subsequent events. UTM parameters are non-persistent by default as they could potentially cause data accuracy problems. Here’s an example of why: Say a user clicks on an ad and lands on your site. He navigates around and bookmarks an internal page - or maybe shares a link with a friend, who shares it with another friend. All those links would then point back to the same test utm_source as the initial referrer for any purchase.
Segment doesn’t validate UTM parameter names. This design supports the flexibility to track both standard parameters (for example, utm_source, utm_medium) and custom parameters defined by users. As a result, all parameters present in the URL collected as is, and are added to the context field without checks for naming conventions or validity.
If you want to ensure that only standard UTM parameters (such as, utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign, utm_content, utm_term) are included in the context.campaign object, you can implementSource middlewarein your Analytics.js setup.
For example:
This middleware filters out any non-standard parameters from thecontext.campaignobject before they’re sent to Segment or forwarded to your enabled destinations.
The Analytics.js library and all Destination libraries are loaded with theHTML scriptasynctag. This also means that Segment fires methods asynchronously, so you should adjust your code accordingly if you require that events be sent from the browser in a specific order.
While many tools require access to the DOM or cookies, for the Zendesk, Salesforce, and Mailchimp destinations, Segment doesn’t need to load a native JavaScript library. Instead, Segment’s servers send data to the end-tools.
Segment loads the libraries required for yourenabledDestinations. When you disable a destination, the custom version of Analytics.js loaded on your site stops requesting that library.
Using Analytics.js doesn’t offer a large performance benefit, but is more performant than installing each of the destinations individually. And as more destinations move to accept data directly from Segment, you’ll receive more performance benefits automatically.
One option, if you don’t want to use any bundled third-party tools, is to use theAnalytics-Nodepackage.
Analytics.js doesn’t set third-party cookies and only sets first-party cookies.
Segment’s Analytics.js JavaScript snippet increases the page size by about 1.1KB.
The snippet asynchronously requests and loads a customized JavaScript bundle (analytics.min.js), which contains the code and settings needed to load yourdevice-mode destinations. The size of this file changes depending on the number of and which destinations you enable.
Without any destinations enabled, theanalytics.min.jsfile is about 62KB. Each time you enable a destination, the file’s size may increase slightly.
Segment sets three cookies in general:
For Google Chrome, these cookies expire by defaultone yearafter the date created. Othersupported browsersmight have a different expiration time.
Some user/group traits are also stored inlocalStorage:
Note thatlocalStoragevariables don’t expire because the browser defines that functionality.
Analytics.js useslocalstoragecookies if you have retries enabled, to keep track of retry timing.
For more information, visit theSegment localstorage-retry library.
You can set thedebugcookie toanalytics.jsto log debug messages from Analytics.js to the console.
Segment does not endorse bypassing tracking blockers or browser privacy settings for client-side tracking. Your users have control over what gets loaded on their pages and can use plugins or browser settings to block third-party scripts, including Segment. To minimize client-side data loss, Segment recommends you choose from the following routes:
To minimize client-side data loss, Segment provides a few workarounds. However, it’s important to note that Segment cannot guarantee their effectiveness.
Use thebundle obfuscationfeature. You can add an obfuscate property to the object in the second parameter, which obscures the URL from which your integrations and destination actions are loaded. This helps prevent words that are flagged by ad blockers to not be detected in your URL, enabling the integration to properly load.
Create acustom proxy. This changes the URL that Segment loads from (cdn.segment.com) and the outgoing requests generated when events are triggered (api.segment.io).
Consider implementing theSegment Edge SDK. The Segment Edge SDK leverages Cloudflare Workers to facilitate first-party data collection and real-time user profiling for app personalization. It integrates Segment’s library into web apps, manages user identity via HttpOnly cookies, and employs an internal router for efficient data processing and user experience customization. This innovative approach simplifies tracking and personalization for Segment customers. More information is available in theEdge SDK README.
Consider using one of Segment’sserver-side libraries. Using a server-side library eliminates concerns about tracking blockers and privacy browsers that can prevent Segment from loading. This option may require additional code to track actions like a Page call, as you now need to manually pass contextual information that would have been automatically collected by Analytics.js, likeurl,path, andreferrer. Note that some destinations are device-mode only.
When you load Analytics.js through snippet code, by default, the SDK installs onwindow.analyticsglobal variable. If this causes a conflict with another library on your page, you can change the global variable used by Analytics.js if you use snippet version 5.2.1 or later.
Change the global variable in the beginning of your snippet code as shown below. In this case, Analytics.js useswindow.custom_keyto load instead ofwindow.analytics.
Bundle the destinations you want loaded fromnpminstead of having them loaded from a remote CDN. This enables you to have fewer network requests when adding destinations.
To add actions-based destinations from npm:
Pass in the destination plugin to the added config option calledplugins.  A list of all action destination packages can be found on GitHub in the@segmentio/action-destinationsrepository.
To add classic destinations from npm:
The Segment Inspector is a Chrome web extension that enables you to debug your Segment integration on web applications instrumented with Analytics.js. Analytics.js sends data to the extension so that you can see how events change before they’re sent to your destinations and so that you can verify that the event details are correct. The Segment Inspector also lets you analyze and confirm that API calls made from your website arrive to your Analytics.js source.
For the Segment inspector to work, you must enable the Analytics.js source.
To add the Segment Inspector as a Chrome extension:
Once installed, use the Inspect Elements developer tool in Chrome to use the Segment Inspector. To access the Inspector, go to the top menu bar of Chrome and navigate toView > Developer > Developer Toolsand go to theSegmenttab. On the Segment tab, you can:
The Segment Inspector is composed of these three components:
Here are some examples of using Analytics.js. Note that the examples assume Analytics.js is installed throughnpm.

Identify users to determine if they're new or existing customers, and tie each person to the right actions.
Locate users so you know what page they were on and what device they were using when they performed the action.
We’ve built all the tools you need to manage your customer data.
See a live stream of your event data flowing from your app to Segment’s API.
Replay your existing data to try new tools faster and eliminate vendor lock-in.

A first-party data collection platform is a tool that allows you to collect data from people who visit your website, use your products, or visit your physical locations. Governing how and where first-party data can be used is the key tofirst-party data privacy.
Segment helps collect, clean, and consolidate first-party data at scale and in real time. With unified profiles, businesses gain a 360-degree view of their customers to understand their behavior, preferences, and trends. This can be used to create highly nuanced audience segments and to orchestrate personalized experiences based on people’s real-time behavior.
Segment helps collect, clean, and consolidate first-party data at scale and in real time. With unified profiles, businesses gain a 360-degree view of their customers to understand their behavior, preferences, and trends. This can be used to create highly nuanced audience segments and to orchestrate personalized experiences based on people’s real-time behavior. With the ability to send this data to any downstream tool for activation, Segment drastically improves time-to-value. Technical teams save valuable time spent integrating new tools and pulling audiences lists, while marketers gain the ability to spin up data-driven campaigns autonomously.
Segment uses a single API to collect customer event data and to enrich that data with information stored in a data warehouse, CRM, payment systems, internal databases, and more. You can connect your data Sources in-app, or programmatically with theSegment API.
Connections offers more than 450 pre-built integrations that include storage systems (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, Amazon S3, Redshift), business intelligence tools, and marketing automation tools. With Functions, teams can also create their own custom sources and destinations.

Align all the teams in your company around a single data dictionary.
Replace outdated spreadsheets with a living breathing Tracking Plan
Give your analysts and marketers documentation so they can confidently use your data
Reduce implementation errors with Typewriter and an extensible API
Manually testing your tracking code is time consuming and doesn’t always catch every incorrect property or data type. With automatic Data Validation, you can audit your implementation in minutes.
Most companies detect issues after their team has used bad data to make decisions or trigger campaigns. Quickly take action on every invalid event with in-app reporting and daily email digests.
“Until we started standardizing our data, people didn’t realize how messy it had become. With Protocols, we can be confident that data quality issues don’t happen anymore.”
“Protocols provides the context my teams need to effectively use our customer data in campaigns and analyses.”
Data cleansing is the process of ensuring data is complete, accurate, and reliable so that it can be used for analysis, decision-making, and reporting. Data cleansing includes correcting outdated or missing information, applying standardized naming conventions to data entries for consistency, deduplicating events, recording data transformations for transparency, and more.
Without properly cleaning data, organizations run the risk of basing strategies and campaigns off inaccurate or misleading information. Duplicate data entries, incomplete fields, and inconsistent naming conventions are common culprits behind “bad data,” which can cost businesses millions of dollars each year in misguided insights and poor decision-making.

Segment’s Stance on Security
We take the responsibility of helping you manage your customer data seriously. That’s why security and privacy are key focus areas for our organization and product development.
Your data is encrypted at rest and protected by TLS in transit. Your Segment password is hashed using bcrypt, and we manage our productionsecretswith AWS tools.
Our projects pass thorough security-design reviews, threat models, and regular pen tests using trusted security vendors. We also employ a public bug bounty for continuous assessment.
We systematically limit internal access to critical tools and resources using time-based access.
For more details on security at Segment, download our Security Overview.
Centrally manage your policies for access with Single Sign-On (SSO) on the Business plan.
Control access to your Sources and Workspaces with fine-grained permissions to manage how your users interact with your data.
SCIM allows your Identity Provider (IdP) to manage users and group membership within the Segment application.
When choosing a new password, we provide visual guidance to help customers pick strong passwords that have not been exposed in security breaches on other websites.
MFA provides an additional layer of security beyond your username and password. When logging into Segment, you’ll also enter a code from your mobile phone.
Ensuring the security and integrity of the Segment platform is critical to the service we provide our customers. We are committed to delivering a secure product and greatly appreciate help from the community in responsibly identifying ways for us to improve.

By responsibly reporting vulnerabilities in our applications or online services, you enable us to address them promptly and protect our community. While this program doesn't offer monetary rewards, your contribution is invaluable to us. If you find a vulnerability, please follow our submission guidelines to let us know.

For those interested in earning rewards for their security expertise, we offer a Bug Bounty Program through the Bugcrowd platform. This program invites experienced security researchers to identify and report vulnerabilities in our applications and internet-facing assets. Eligible findings may qualify for monetary bounties based on their severity and impact. By participating, you not only help us strengthen our security but also receive recognition and compensation for your valuable contributions. If you've discovered a vulnerability and wish to join our Bug Bounty Program, please read our bounty brief and submit your report here.

Do you make, break, and tinker with things? Are you a seeker of unconventional wisdom? Do you think in algorithms? Then welcome to FTFY, also known as Fixed That For You—a show about solving problems with data and algorithms.

4.22.2019   |
Running the New York City Marathon is a major accomplishment for anyone. Now imagine doing it without being able to see.
In this episode of Fixed That For You, we follow Simon Wheatcroft—who has been blind since the age of 17—on his quest to run the New York City Marathon. Find out how Simon used data collection to take a massive step forward for the visually impaired around the world.
In the race of his life, he battles skyscrapers, metal bridges, and massive crowds, pushing a piece of experimental gadgetry to its breaking point. Along the way, he reflects on how innovative solutions, like moderneHeizungssysteme, can empower people in their daily lives. Find out what happened and whether it can be a massive step forward for visually impaired people around the world.

10,000 tulips, the price of Bitcoin, and competing computers. On this episode of Fixed That For You we ask “Can a computer make art?” If that sounds too philosophical, just remember, artificial intelligence is trying to save us time by doing the repetitive jobs we hate. Artist Anna Ridler goes from writing simple formulas in Excel to directing a Generative Adversarial Network that creates a dynamic art installation.
3.25.2019   |
Should I stay or should I go? In every romantic relationship, there is a moment that you ask yourself, “Is it worth it?” Well, Rashied Amini, a NASA engineer with a broken heart, has the answer. He’s created a “Love Life Prediction Algorithm” — comparing your ‘bird in the hand’ with every bird that is still out there. Be warned; you might not like the answer his algorithm gives you.
3.11.2019   |
Turtles have been around since the days of the dinosaurs — but are they about to follow them into extinction? Conservation scientist Kim Williams-Guillén is doing her best to prevent that. In this episode of ‘Fixed That For You’ we combine 'Breaking Bad,' a Hollywood special effects expert, and a 3D printer to track down poachers on remote tropical beaches.
2.25.2019   |
Of the thousands of books published this year, how can we predict which will become bestsellers? Book lovers, Jodie Archer and Matt Jockers, set out to answer this million dollar question with an algorithm. In this episode of ‘Fixed That For You,’ we merge art and science by turning words into numbers. Discover the secret similarities betweenThe Da Vinci CodeandFifty Shades of Grey, and learn how an open-source library can help you write a best-seller of your own.
2.11.2019   |
Is the humble hamburger our planet’s new hero? It is according to biochemist Pat Brown. In this episode of ‘Fixed That For You’ we visit Brown’s Impossible Foods lab where he’s broken down America’s favorite food into one delicious dataset. Join us as we figure out exactly which molecules make burgers taste the way they do, and then try to find those exact same molecules in plants.
1.28.2019   |
What if an algorithm could be your doctor? Living with Type 1 diabetes usually means making a lot of medical decisions on your own, sometimes daily. In this episode of ‘Fixed That For You’, you’ll hear about a problem millions of sick people face daily. It’s the story of Dana Lewis, a young woman who got tired of managing her disease, and decided to replace biology with data by creating an artificial pancreas. The results? Life changing.
1.14.2019   |
There is a festival in India so amazing that millions of people attend every year – despite the near certainty that many will die. Nilay Kulkarni grew up hearing the horror stories of human stampedes that claimed hundreds of lives annually.
With a desire to prevent what seemed inevitable, the guiding voice of his grandfather, a hackathon, and a set of black rubber mats, Kulkarni took on human stampedes. This episode of ‘Fixed That For You’ combines the science of crowd control with the power of a lifesaving DIY data collection tool.

Do you make, break, and tinker with things? Are you a seeker of unconventional wisdom? Like to celebrate engineer-specific thinking? Then welcome to FTFY, also known as Fixed That For You—a show about solving problems with data and algorithms.

Watch a Product Tour to see Segment's CDP in action and learn how it can impact your business.
Last updated September 2, 2020
What happened?
Between August 26 and August 31, 2019 an unauthorized party compromised a Segment employee’s Segment web application account without their knowledge, logging in with their email and password. This account had privileged access.
Using the employee’s account during this August 26 - August 31 time period, the unauthorized party acquired data relating to how Segment's own customers use the Segment product. This includes information about how Segment's own users interact with our application and associated Segment account information (email address, first and last name, IP address for each session, and Segment write keys). No Segment customer passwords were compromised.
This data is used by our product, marketing, and customer success teams to provide ongoing support for our customers.
When did Segment discover the issue? What did Segment do when it discovered the issue?
We learned about the incident on August 31. Upon detection, we took immediate action, disabling and deleting the account that was compromised. We then began a full investigation to understand and assess the impact of the incident.
What information was involved?
Over the course of our investigation, we learned that during the August 26 - August 31 time period, the unauthorized party acquired data relating to how our customers use their Segment workspaces. This includes:
Two months of recent data about how Segment's own customers interact with different aspects of our product, including customer write keys for Segment (which are considered public), integration names, workspace names, and how customers interact with our user interface. This data includes first names, last names, email addresses, and IP addresses of your employees.
Basic account data, including a list of Segment user email addresses, first names, last names, business address, phone number and customer write keys for Segment (which are considered public), integration names and workspace names.
For a small subset of customers (13), the unauthorized party was able to gain read-only access to their workspaces and click around in their accounts for up to a few minutes. These customers have been notified on September 5th.
Was my customer information exposed?
The unauthorized party acquired two months of historical data relating to how Segment’sowncustomers use their own Segment workspaces. This didnotinclude any information about your customers. Most Segment customers that were impacted received a general security notice regarding this aspect of the incident.
For a small subset of Segment customers (13) who were notified on September 5th, the unauthorized party gained read-only access to their workspaces for up to a few minutes. These customers have been notified in a separate, explicit communication if this occurred.
What is Segment doing to ensure this doesn’t happen again?
We have taken immediate action and are continuing to investigate and assess the impact of this incident. Upon discovery, we:
Enforced mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all employees when accessing Segment-owned workspaces and performing administrative actions in the Segment app.
Reset all employee sessions and passwords as a precautionary measure.
Notified relevant law enforcement authorities.
Removed privileged access internally for the Segment app, and then restructured the access so that it is granted on an as-needed basis.
Began an audit of internal access controls to mitigate the risk of an event like this happening in the future.
What should I do about this incident?
Unless you have been specifically instructed differently by Segment, there is no direct action required. However, this is a good opportunity to make sure that your Segment password is a unique, strong password. We’d also recommend you activate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Thisblog postcovers strong passwords and activating MFA.
We apologize for any inconveniences this incident may cause. If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to us atsupport@segment.com.
Our annual look at how attitudes, preferences, and experiences with personalization have evolved over the past year.
We’ll share a copy of this guide and send you content and updates about Twilio Segment’s products as we continue to build the world’s leading CDP. We use your information according to ourprivacy policy. You can update your preferences at any time.

Legal ObligationLegitimate Interest
We disclose personal data to third parties in limited circumstances in order to provide the Services and to otherwise run our business. Below are the different scenarios under which we may disclose your data to third parties.
Telecommunications Service Providers
Twilio’s communications products provide an easier way for developers to build applications that make use of the publicly switched telephone network (PSTN) to send communications. Therefore, we engage with a global network of telecommunications operators, aggregators, carriers and other communication service providers (collectively, “telecommunications service providers”) as necessary to route and connect those communications from the sender to the intended recipient. How telecommunications service providers handle this data is generally determined by their own policies and local regulations.
Where telecommunications service providers transmit the content of a communication, they function neither as data controllers nor data processors, instead they act simply as a conduit to transmit communication content. In the event telecommunications services providers process any personal data for their own purposes such as communications metadata required to transmit the message, or for billing or fraud prevention purposes, they also act as data controllers.
We may have to share Subscriber Records with local government authorities or local telecommunications carriers that provide connectivity services. However, we don’t share subscriber records for purposes other than this, and we treat these records with our highest confidentiality.
Other Communications Service Providers
For proper routing and connectivity, Twilio also enables sending or receiving communications through communications service providers that do not use the PSTN, these are referred to as Over-the-Top (OTT) communications service providers. If you or our customer chooses to use Twilio to send or receive communications by way of these providers, Twilio will disclose communications content and other data to these providers as necessary to route and connect those communications from the sender to the intended recipient. How those OTT communications service providers, as data controllers, handle this data is determined by their own policies and local regulations.
Third Party Service Providers
Twilio engages third-party vendors and service providers to carry out certain personal data processing functions on our behalf. These providers are limited to only accessing or using personal data to provide services to us and must provide reasonable assurances they will appropriately safeguard the data.
Add-On Partners
Add-ons are additional features, functionality or services offered by Twilio’s Add-on partners (who are third parties not affiliated with Twilio). Twilio may make Add-ons available through the Twilio Marketplace. Some Add-ons may need to access or collect some of your information, including personal data. If you choose to use an Add-on, Twilio will disclose your information to the Add-on partner so you can use the Add-on. Twilio does not control Add-on partners’ use of your information and their use of your information will be in accordance with their own policies. If you do not want your information to be disclosed to an Add-on partner, then you should not use the Add-on.
Twilio Group Members
We may disclose your personal data among Twilio Group Members. Twilio Group Members will only use the information as described in this Privacy Notice. Twilio Group Members are listed in Appendix 1 in ourBinding Corporate Rules.
Compliance with Legal Obligations
We may disclose your personal data to a third party if:
to protect the security or integrity of our services and products;
to protect ourselves, our other customers, or the public from harm or illegal activities; or
to respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose data to assist in preventing a death or serious bodily injury.
For more details, please see the procedure laid out in ourBinding Corporate Rules.
If Twilio is required by law to disclose any personal data about you, we will notify you of the disclosure requirement to the extent legally permitted and where Twilio determines such disclosure will not interfere with an ongoing investigation. Further, we object to information requests we do not believe were issued properly.
Business Transfers
In connection with a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, personal data about you may be part of the assets transferred or disclosed in connection with the due diligence for any such transaction. If required by law, we will notify you prior to such a transfer and provide you with information about any choices you may have with respect to your personal data.
Aggregated, Anonymized or De-identified Data
Aggregated, anonymized and de-identified data may be derived by Twilio from your personal data but is generally not considered personal data under data protection law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. We may use and disclose de-identified, anonymized or aggregated data to third parties. We do not disaggregate or reidentify de-identified data.
As a global organization, we may need to transfer your personal data to Twilio affiliates, contractors, service providers and third parties in various countries and jurisdictions around the world. When we transfer your personal data, we take care to use appropriate safeguards to ensure your personal data remains protected.
Data Transfers to the United States and Elsewhere
When you use our account portal, or our other products and services, your personal data may be transferred to the United States, where our primary processing facilities are located, and possibly to other countries where we or our service providers operate.
Safeguards for Data Transfers
Twilio employs appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers of personal data, as required by applicable local law.
EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF“)
As set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce Twilio is officially certified under the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and Swiss-U.S. DPF and relies on these certifications as its primary transfer mechanisms for transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S. Twilio adheres to the DPF principles for onward transfers of personal data to third parties and remains liable for damages caused by third parties under the DPF unless Twilio did not cause the event giving rise to damage. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Twilio’s compliance with the DPF. To learn more about the DPF Program, and to view our certifications, please visit theDPF website.
Twilio’s Binding Corporate Rules
Twilio has established and implemented a set ofBinding Corporate Rulesfor internal transfers of personal data between Twilio Group Members in the European Union and Twilio Group Members elsewhere as a data controller. Twilio’s BCRs have been approved by European Union Data Protection Authorities and are a commitment by Twilio to adequately protect personal data that Twilio processes regardless of where the information resides. You can access Twilio’s BCR-Controller Policyhere.
Where neither the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, Swiss-EU DPF nor Twilio's BCRs apply, we rely instead on other data transfer mechanisms to transfer personal data outside the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland, such as Standard Contractual Clauses and the UK’s International Data Transfer Agreement.
APEC CBPR & PRP Participation
Twilio’s privacy practices, described in this Privacy Notice, comply with the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules (“CBPR”) and Privacy Recognition for Processors (“PRP”) Systems. The APEC, CBPR and PRP systems provide a framework for organizations to ensure protection of personal data transferred among participating APEC economies. More information about the APEC framework can be foundhere.

To protect personal data from loss, or unauthorized use, access or disclosure, Twilio uses reasonable and appropriate security measures designed to protect the security of your personal data both online and offline. These measures vary based on the sensitivity of the personal data we collect, process and store and the current state of technology.  All systems used to support our business are governed by Twilio’s Information Security Policy and Standards which are built on industry standards and best practices such as the ISO 27001 and NIST standards. More information about our security measures can be found in ourSecurity Overview.
We endeavor not to retain personal data in a form which permits identification of individuals for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which that data is processed. We retain personal data in accordance with Twilio's record retention policies and guidelines as revised and updated from time to time.
Twilio will store your Customer Account Data as long as needed to provide you or our customer with the Services and to operate our business. If you ask Twilio to delete specific personal data from your Customer Account Data (see ‘Your Rights and Choices About Your Data’ below), we will honor this request, unless deleting that information prevents us from carrying out necessary business functions, such as billing for our services, calculating taxes, or conducting required audits.

that you not be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, that produces legal effects or similarly affects your individual rights;
to withdraw your consent; and
to complain to a competent supervisory authority and/or to commence proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction.
Twilio will honor your rights subject to limitations in certain situations, such as where Twilio can demonstrate that it has a legal requirement or legitimate interest to process your data or can legitimately apply an exemption to the exercise of a right under applicable law.

The Authy service is our standalone two-factor authentication (2FA) service for desktop and mobile. The Authy apps generate one time passwords and push notifications that can be used as a part of a two-step verification process with your Authy-compatible accounts to add another layer of security. Authy’s 2FA can be used on its own or with applications that directly integrate with Authy’s 2-factor authentication API.
Due to the nature of the Authy service, Twilio collects the following additional personal data elements to other Twilio services:
Identifiers
Once you open the Authy app, we ask you to provide us with a phone number to create your Authy account. We send a verification code to that phone number to be sure that the person creating the Authy account also has control over the phone number entered. This phone number is considered your “primary device,” and will be the identifier for your Authy account. We use that phone number to identify you, to provide you 2FA services, and to maintain logs for security and anti-fraud purposes. We also collect your email address, and we use it for identity verification and account recovery purposes.
Device Information
When you download and open the Authy desktop or mobile app, we automatically collect information about the type of device you have downloaded the app on and your device identifier. We collect this to ensure we deliver the right version of the app for your device and so that we can provide appropriate follow up support as necessary. We also use your device information to ensure proper delivery of our service and to provide and deliver support and maintenance of the Authy app.
Login History and Authy Account History
When you use an Authy token to log into an account, whether the token was generated on the app or one sent to you via your phone number, we collect and keep information associated with your login activity including information like your IP address, what application you logged in to, that you logged in, and when. If you change your phone number or email associated with your Authy account, we will also keep a log of that. We collect this information to monitor for suspicious activity and also as another piece of information that could be used to verify your identity if we suspect your account may be compromised.
Geolocation information
If you have location services turned on, we collect your location based on your IP address. We use this information for anti-fraud purposes, to check for suspicious activity and as another piece of information we can use to verify your identity if we suspect your account may be compromised.
To use the Frontline services, you must log in to the Frontline app using a third party account (through your Single Sign-On provider). The authentication of your login details is handled by that third party and we only collect the information you expressly agree to share with us at the time you give permission to link the Frontline app with the third party account. We only gather the information you and our customers give us access to, and we only use it for the purposes for which you and our customers have provided it to us. Please see theFrontline App Termsfor specific details about your relationship with us.
The SendGrid services also collect additional data in the form of web beacons placed in the body of emails delivered using the SendGrid platform. This allows us to keep track of whether or not an email has been delivered, opened, clicked on, whether it bounced or was treated as spam. You can learn more about web beacons in the section titled “How We Use Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies” above.
Voice Intelligence incorporates artificial intelligence and machine learning to transcribe and analyze voice calls into a structured format that allows our customers to drive their business processes. To translate voice calls into structured content, Twilio processes certain data as a controller, including personal data contained in voice calls disclosed to us by our customer through their use of the service.

If you breach your payment obligations to the Fulfillment Reseller and fail to cure such breach within the time period specified in the Fulfillment Agreement, the Fulfillment Reseller or Twilio may suspend the provision of the Services to you upon written notice.

What is ours is ours, including the following:
(a) our services;
(b)our published documentation on our website;
(c) our confidential information;
(d) any data that is derived or generated from the use or provision of our services that does not identify or no longer identifies you, your end users, or any natural person or any data that is anonymized, de-identified, and/or aggregated; and
(e) any feedback you or your end users provide to us about our services.
Additionally, what is yours is yours, including the software applications you develop or products and services you offer, your confidential information, and your data.
4.1 Ownership Rights.  As between the parties, Twilio exclusively owns and reserves all right, title, and interest in and to the Services, the Documentation, Twilio's Confidential Information (as defined in Section 4.3.1 (Definition)), Twilio Data, as well as any feedback or suggestions you or your End Users provide regarding the Services. As between the parties, you exclusively own and reserve all right, title, and interest in and to the Customer Services, your Confidential Information, and Customer Data, subject to Twilio’s rights to process Customer Data in accordance with this Agreement and the Twilio Data Protection Addendum.
We or our affiliates can use your data in order to provide you with our services according to our obligations in these terms and the terms ofour Data Protection Addendum.
4.2 Customer Data.  You grant Twilio and its Affiliates the right to process Customer Data as necessary to provide the Services in a manner that is consistent with this Agreement and the Twilio Data Protection Addendum. You are responsible for the quality and integrity of Customer Data.
Neither of us will tell anyone else about or use the confidential information that we got from each other, except as allowed under these terms and the terms ofour Data Protection Addendum.
If either of us shares the other’s confidential information with third parties, then the one sharing that confidential information will make sure those third parties comply with these confidentiality obligations.
4.3 Confidentiality
4.3.1 Definition.  “Confidential Information” means any information or data, regardless of whether it is in tangible form, disclosed by either party (“Disclosing Party”) to the other party (“Receiving Party”) that is marked or otherwise designated as confidential or proprietary or that should otherwise be reasonably understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure, including, without limitation, this Agreement, Order Form(s), Customer Data, security reports and attestations, audit reports, customer lists, pricing, concepts, processes, plans, designs and other strategies, “know how”, inventions, and financial, technical, or other business information and materials of Disclosing Party and its Affiliates. Confidential Information does not include any information which: (a) is publicly available through no breach of this Agreement or fault of Receiving Party; (b) was properly known by Receiving Party, and to its knowledge, without any restriction, prior to disclosure by Disclosing Party; (c) was properly disclosed to Receiving Party, and to its knowledge, without any restriction, by another person without violation of Disclosing Party's rights; or (d) is independently developed by Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Confidential Information of Disclosing Party.
4.3.2 Use and Disclosure.  Except as otherwise authorized under Section 4.3.3 (Compelled Disclosure), under the Twilio Data Protection Addendum, or by Disclosing Party in writing, Receiving Party will not (a) use any Confidential Information of Disclosing Party for any purpose outside of exercising Receiving Party’s rights or fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement and (b) disclose or make Confidential Information of Disclosing Party available to any party, except to Receiving Party's Affiliates, and Receiving Party's and its Affiliates’ respective employees, legal counsel, accountants, contractors, and in Twilio’s case, subcontractors (collectively, “Representatives”) who have a “need to know” as necessary for Receiving Party to exercise its rights or fulfill its obligations under this Agreement. Receiving Party will be responsible for its Representatives’ compliance with this Section 4.3. Representatives will be legally bound to protect Confidential Information of Disclosing Party under terms of confidentiality that are at least as protective as the terms of this Section 4.3. Receiving Party will protect the confidentiality of Confidential Information of Disclosing Party using the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own confidential information but in no event less than reasonable care. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may disclose Twilio’s SOC2 or similar report, which will constitute Twilio’s Confidential Information, only to your End Users or your End Users' employee or contract worker who has a “need to know” for such SOC2 or similar report and is legally bound to terms of confidentiality that are at least as protective as the terms of this Section 4.3.
Either of us may disclose the confidential information we got from the other if requested by a regulator or required by regulation, law, subpoena, or court order, if we fulfill certain conditions, such as providing written notice, if legally allowed and such disclosure does not interfere with an investigation into potential illegal activity, and reasonable cooperation.
4.3.3 Compelled Disclosure.  Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of Disclosing Party if so required pursuant to a request from a regulator or pursuant to regulation, law, subpoena, or court order (collectively, “Compelled Disclosures”), provided Receiving Party gives Disclosing Party written notice of a Compelled Disclosure to the extent (a) legally permitted and (b) where, when Twilio is Receiving Party, it determines that such Compelled Disclosure will not unduly interfere with an ongoing investigation into potential illegal activity. Receiving Party will provide reasonable cooperation to Disclosing Party in connection with a Compelled Disclosure at Disclosing Party’s sole expense.
Money alone may not be enough to make either of us whole if one of us breaks our promise of confidentiality. As such, either of us may seek other remedies, like gag orders, if needed.
4.3.4 Injunctive Relief.  The parties expressly acknowledge and agree that no adequate remedy may exist at law for an actual or threatened breach of this Section 4.3 and that, in the event of an actual or threatened breach of the provisions of this Section 4.3, the non-breaching party will be entitled to seek immediate injunctive and other equitable relief, without waiving any other rights or remedies available to it.
We may use and display your name, logo, and a description of how you use our services on our website, in earnings releases, and in other marketing materials. We promise to follow any usage guidelines that you provide to us.
4.4 Use of Marks.  You grant Twilio the right to use and display your name, logo, and a description of your use case(s) on Twilio’s website, in earnings releases and calls, and in marketing and promotional materials, subject to your standard trademark usage guidelines that you expressly provide to Twilio.

Each of us agrees to these terms and promises it has the legal power to do so.
5.1 Power and Authority Representation.  Each party represents and warrants that it has validly accepted or entered into this Agreement and has the legal power to do so.
Each of us will follow anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, economic and trade sanctions, export controls, and other international trade laws, regulations, and government orders. Each of us also confirms that we, or our organization, is not on any government sanctions or restricted party lists of people and organizations that companies like Twilio are not allowed to do business with.
If you or your end users become placed on any government sanctions or restricted party lists, you will stop using our services and remove any end users’ access to our services.

You will promptly notify Twilio in writing of any actual or potential violation of Anti-Corruption and Trade Laws in connection with the use of the Services and take all appropriate steps to remedy or resolve such violations, including any steps requested by Twilio. If applicable, you represent that you have obtained, and warrant that you will continue to obtain, all licenses or other authorizations required to export, re-export, or transfer the Services. Each party represents that it (and in your case, also your End Users) is not on any government prohibited, denied, or unverified-party, sanctions, debarment, or exclusion list or export-controlled related restricted party list (collectively, “Sanctions Lists”). You will immediately (i) discontinue your use of the Services if you become placed on any Sanctions List and (ii) remove your End Users’ access to the Services if your End Users become placed on any Sanctions List. You represent that you have not, and warrant that you will not, export, re-export, or transfer the Services to an entity on any Sanctions List without prior authorization from the applicable governmental authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, either party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to the other party if the other party is in breach of its obligations in this Section 5.2.

You will only give us data for which you provided any required notices and received any required permissions, including in a manner as required by law or regulation. In addition, we will only use this data according to these terms and the terms ofour Data Protection Addendum.
5.3 Consents and Permissions.  You represent and warrant that you have provided, and will continue to provide, adequate notices, and that you have obtained, and will continue to obtain, the necessary permissions and consents required to enable Twilio to process all Customer Data to provide the Services or as permitted by this Agreement and the Twilio Data Protection Addendum.
Our services will work the way we say they will inour published documentation on our website.
5.4 Services.  Twilio represents and warrants that the Services perform materially in accordance with the applicable Documentation. Your exclusive remedy for a breach of this Section 5.4 will be, at Twilio’s option, to (a) remediate any material non-conformity or (b) refund you the Fees paid for the time period during which the affected Services do not comply with this Section 5.4.
Except for any of the explicit promises in this Section 5, we are offering our services “as is.” You also understand that we are not responsible if anything happens to your data outside of our network or for anything that happens resulting from:
(a) your use of our beta offerings;
(b) the software applications you develop or the products and services you offer; or
(c) any products and services provided by a third-party provider.
5.5 DISCLAIMER.  WITHOUT LIMITING A PARTY’S EXPRESS WARRANTIES AND OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER, AND EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” AND NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, AND EACH PARTY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. TWILIO ADDITIONALLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES RELATED TO TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THE INTERNET AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS’ NETWORKS ARE INHERENTLY INSECURE AND THAT TWILIO WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY CHANGES TO, INTERCEPTION OF, OR LOSS OF CUSTOMER DATA WHILE IN TRANSIT VIA THE INTERNET OR A TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDER’S NETWORK. BETA OFFERINGS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”. TWILIO MAKES NO WARRANTIES AND WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY BETA OFFERINGS, CUSTOMER SERVICES, OR THIRD PARTY SERVICES WHATSOEVER.

If someone comes after you claiming that our provision of our services violates their intellectual property rights, we will fight that fight for you and pay any awarded damages or settlement we enter into.
6.1 Indemnification by Twilio
6.1.1 Scope of Indemnification.  Twilio will defend you, your Affiliates, and each of their directors, officers, and employees (collectively, “Customer Indemnified Parties”) from and against any claim, demand, suit, or proceeding made or brought against a Customer Indemnified Party by a third party alleging that Twilio’s provision of the Services infringes or misappropriates such third party’s intellectual property rights (“Twilio Indemnifiable Claim”). Twilio will indemnify you from any fines, penalties, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs awarded against a Customer Indemnified Party or for settlement amounts approved by Twilio for a Twilio Indemnifiable Claim.
If we think our services infringe someone’s intellectual property rights, then, in addition to fighting the fight as we talk about above, we will either obtain the rights for you to continue to use our services or modify our services, so they do not infringe. If we cannot do either of these, we will terminate these terms and refund you any prepaid and unused fees.
6.1.2 Infringement Options.  If Twilio’s provision of the Services has become, or in Twilio’s opinion is likely to become, the subject of any Twilio Indemnifiable Claim for third-party intellectual property rights infringement or misappropriation, Twilio may at its option and expense: (a) procure the right to continue to provide the Services as set forth herein; (b) modify the Services to make them non-infringing; or (c) if the foregoing options are not reasonably practicable, terminate this Agreement, or, if applicable, terminate the Services that are the subject of any Twilio Indemnifiable Claim for third-party intellectual property rights infringement or misappropriation, and refund you any unused pre-paid Fees.
In this Section 6.1.3, we describe situations where we do not have to indemnify you, such as (a) your violation of these terms, (b) any claims brought against you by someone due to your use of our services in combination with other applications or services, or (c) your use of our services that are free of charge or our beta offerings.
6.1.3 Limitations.  Twilio will have no liability or obligation under this Section 6.1 with respect to any Twilio Indemnifiable Claim arising out of (a) your use of the Services in breach of this Agreement; (b) the combination, operation, or use of the Services with other applications, portions of applications, products, or services, including, without limitation, the Customer Services or Third Party Services, where the Services would not by themselves be infringing; or (c) Services for which there is no charge or Beta Offerings.
Similar to above, you need to fight the fight if someone comes after us because you or your end users breach your responsibilities in Section 2.2 (Customer Responsibilities) or because of the software applications you develop or the products and services you offer.
6.2 Indemnification by Customer.  You will defend Twilio, its Affiliates, and each of their directors, officers, and employees (collectively, “Twilio Indemnified Parties”) from and against any claim, demand, suit, or proceeding made or brought against a Twilio Indemnified Party by a third party alleging or arising out of: (a) your or your End Users’ breach of Section 2.2 (Customer Responsibilities) or (b) any Customer Services infringing or misappropriating such third party’s intellectual property rights (collectively, “Customer Indemnifiable Claims”). You will indemnify Twilio from any fines, penalties, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs awarded against a Twilio Indemnified Party or for settlement amounts that you approve for a Customer Indemnifiable Claim.
This Section 6.3 outlines the indemnification process - how it works, what is required, etc.  It applies to both of us equally.  Please be sure to read it.
6.3 Conditions of Indemnification.  As a condition of the foregoing indemnification obligations: (a) the indemnified party (“Indemnified Party”) will promptly notify the indemnifying party (“Indemnifying Party”) of any Customer Indemnifiable Claim or Twilio Indemnifiable Claim (individually or collectively referred to herein as a “Claim”)in writing; provided, however, that the failure to give prompt written notice will not relieve Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that Indemnifying Party was actually and materially prejudiced by such failure; (b) Indemnifying Party will have the sole authority to defend or settle a Claim; and (c) Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate with Indemnifying Party in connection with Indemnifying Party’s activities hereunder, at Indemnifying Party’s expense. Indemnified Party reserves the right, at its own expense, to participate in the defense of a Claim. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Indemnifying Party will not settle any Claim for which it has an obligation to indemnify under this Section 6 admitting liability or fault on behalf of Indemnified Party, nor create any obligation on behalf of Indemnified Party without Indemnified Party’s prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.
6.4 Exclusive Remedy.  This Section 6 states Indemnifying Party’s sole liability to, and Indemnified Party’s exclusive remedy against, the other party for any third-party claims.

This Section 7.1 outlines the types of damages that are available in the event of a claim.  At a high level, neither of us is responsible for damages that indirectly result from an incident.
7.1 LIMITATION ON INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, AND RELATED DAMAGES.  IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES HAVE ANY LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, GOODWILL, OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, COVER, LOST DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, WHETHER AN ACTION IS IN CONTRACT OR TORT AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, EVEN IF A PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR IF A PARTY’S OR ITS AFFILIATES’ REMEDY OTHERWISE FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW.
Generally speaking, any direct damages either of us might owe to the other are capped at the amounts you paid us (or should have paid us) in the 12-month period before the incident occurred.
7.2 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  IN NO EVENT WILL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF EITHER PARTY TOGETHER WITH ALL OF ITS AFFILIATES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID OR PAYABLE BY YOU AND YOUR AFFILIATES HEREUNDER FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE FIRST INCIDENT OUT OF WHICH THE LIABILITY AROSE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION WILL APPLY WHETHER AN ACTION IS IN CONTRACT OR TORT AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY.
The only exceptions to the limitations in Section 7.1 (Limitation on Indirect, Consequential, and Related Damages) and Section 7.2 (Limitation of Liability) are for your violation of your responsibilities in Section 2.2 (Customer Responsibilities), your payment obligations in Section 3 (Fees and Payment Terms), and both of our indemnification obligations in Section 6 (Mutual Indemnification).
7.3 EXCEPTIONS TO THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN SECTION 7.1 (LIMITATION ON INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, AND RELATED DAMAGES) AND SECTION 7.2 (LIMITATION OF LIABILITY), THE LIMITATIONS IN SECTION 7.1 AND SECTION 7.2 DO NOT APPLY TO (a) YOUR BREACH OF SECTION 2.2 (CUSTOMER RESPONSIBILITIES); (b) YOUR AND YOUR AFFILIATES’ BREACH OF SECTION 3 (FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS); OR (c) AMOUNTS PAYABLE PURSUANT TO A PARTY’S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 6 (MUTUAL INDEMNIFICATION).

These terms will be valid and effective from the date you agree to them until they are ended according to one of the events in Section 8.2 (Termination) below.
8.1 Agreement Term.  This Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and continue until terminated in accordance with Section 8.2 (Termination) (“Term”).
Either of us may end these terms by providing the other with 30 days advance notice. However, if you have any order forms in effect, those order forms will remain in effect for the duration of their order form term and these terms will continue to apply.
8.2 Termination
8.2.1 For Convenience.  Either party may terminate this Agreement for convenience by providing the other party with at least thirty (30) days prior written notice. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if there are any Order Form(s) in effect, this Agreement will not terminate until all such Order Form(s) have expired or have been terminated in accordance with the terms therein.
If either of us violates these terms and does not fix the violation within 15 days, the other one may end these terms.
Ending these terms will result in the closure of all of your accounts.
8.2.2 Material Breach.  Either party may terminate this Agreement (including all Order Form(s) and Services that are in effect) in the event the other party commits any material breach of this Agreement and fails to remedy such breach within fifteen (15) days of the date of written notice of such breach. For the avoidance of doubt, a breach of the Twilio Acceptable Use Policy will be considered a material breach of this Agreement. If Twilio terminates this Agreement because of your material breach, then Twilio will also close your accounts.
Either of us may end these terms by providing the other with written notice if the other goes bankrupt or fails to continue its business.
8.2.3 Insolvency.  Subject to applicable law, either party may terminate this Agreement immediately by providing written notice in the event of the other party’s liquidation, commencement of dissolution proceedings, or any other proceeding relating to a receivership, failure to continue business, assignment for the benefit of creditors, or becoming the subject of bankruptcy.
Certain important terms live on even after these terms end. That includes your payment obligations to us and the specific sections mentioned on the right.
8.3 Survival.  Upon termination of this Agreement, the terms of this Section 8.3 and the terms of the following Sections will survive: Section 2.1(c) (regarding the Twilio Security Overview), Section 3 (Fees and Payment Terms), Section 4 (Ownership, Customer Data, and Confidentiality), Section 5.5 (Disclaimer), Section 6 (Mutual Indemnification), Section 7 (Limitation of Liability), Section 9 (General), and any applicable terms in Section 10 (Additional Terms).

Your affiliates may use our services according to these terms. However, you and your affiliates are both responsible for the activities of your affiliates.
9.1.1 Affiliates of Customer.  Your Affiliates may use the Services under and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. You represent and warrant that you have sufficient rights and the authority to make this Agreement binding upon each of your Affiliates. You and each of your Affiliates will be jointly and severally liable for the acts and omissions of such Affiliate in connection with this Agreement and such Affiliate’s use of the Services. Only you will bring any claim against Twilio on behalf of your Affiliates.
Our affiliates may provide you or your affiliates with our services or bill you or your affiliates on behalf of us or another Twilio entity providing our services.
9.1.2 Affiliates of Twilio.  An Affiliate of Twilio may provide the Services, or a portion thereof, to you or your Affiliates, as applicable, in accordance with this Agreement and any applicable Order Form(s) with such Affiliate of Twilio. Twilio will (a) be responsible for the Services its Affiliates provide and (b) not be relieved of its obligations under this Agreement if its Affiliates provide the Services or a portion thereof. Twilio will enforce the terms of this Agreement relating to the Services its Affiliates provide. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, an Affiliate of Twilio may directly bill you or your Affiliates, as applicable, (i) for the Services it provides or (ii) solely as a billing agent for Twilio or the Affiliate of Twilio providing the Services, as applicable.
Neither of us may transfer our obligations under these terms without the other’s prior written consent, unless either of us is transferring our obligations to an entity that is assuming either of our assets or business or to either of our affiliates.
9.2 Assignment.  Neither party may assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement or any applicable Order Form(s), in whole or in part, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the other party’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may assign this Agreement or any applicable Order Form(s), in whole or in part, without consent to (a) a successor to all or part of its assets or business or (b) an Affiliate. Any attempted assignment or transfer by either party in violation hereof will be void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement and any applicable Order Form(s) will be binding on the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
These terms do not create any special relationship between us, like an employer-employee relationship, joint venture, or a partnership. Nothing will change that. Each of us is responsible for our own employees and agents.
9.3 Relationship.  Each party is an independent contractor in the performance of each and every part of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to create or will be construed as creating an employer-employee relationship or a partnership, agency, joint venture, or franchise. Each party will be solely responsible for all of its employees and agents and its labor costs and expenses arising in connection therewith and for any and all claims, liabilities, damages, or debts of any type whatsoever that may arise on account of its activities, or those of its employees and agents, in the performance of this Agreement. Neither party has the authority to commit the other party in any way and will not attempt to do so or imply that it has the right to do so.
These terms are strictly between you and us. No third parties have any rights under these terms unless we already say so in these terms.
9.4 No Third-Party Beneficiaries.  This Agreement does not confer any benefits on any third party (including your End Users or an Affiliate) unless it expressly states that it does.

These terms are governed by the law specified in the table below, depending on where your business entity is registered.
If we go to court to resolve a dispute between us, then the courts specified in the table below, depending on where your business entity is registered, will be responsible for resolving that dispute.
9.6 Governing Law and Attorneys’ Fees.  This Agreement will be governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the applicable state or country identified below without regard to conflicts of laws and principles that would cause the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. This Agreement will not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Except as provided in Section 9.7 (Dispute Resolution), any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Services will be instituted in the applicable courts identified below and the parties hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of these courts.

9.7 Dispute Resolution.  In the event of any dispute, claim, or controversy in connection with this Agreement (other than for disputes, claims, or controversies related to the intellectual property of a party) (collectively, “Disputes”), each party’s senior representatives will, in good faith, attempt to resolve a Dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve a Dispute within thirty (30) days or within such other time period as the parties may agree in writing, then the parties may commence binding arbitration under JAMS’ Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. The parties will share equally the fees and expenses of the JAMS arbitrator. The arbitration will be conducted by a sole arbitrator mutually agreed to between the parties or, failing that, by JAMS under its then prevailing rules. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant specific performance or any other equitable or legal remedy, including provisional remedies. Each party will be responsible for its own incurred expenses arising out of any dispute resolution procedure.

If neither of us can carry out our obligations under these terms because something crazy happens beyond either of our control (think earthquake, massive power outage, war), then that does not count as a violation of these terms.
9.8 Force Majeure.  No failure, delay, or default in performance of any obligation of a party will constitute an event of default or breach of this Agreement to the extent that such failure to perform, delay, or default arises out of a cause, existing or future, that is beyond the control and without negligence of such party, including action or inaction of governmental, civil or military authority, fire, strike, lockout, or other labor dispute, flood, terrorist act, war, riot, theft, earthquake, or other natural disaster (collectively, “Force Majeure Events”). The party affected by a Force Majeure Event will take all reasonable actions to minimize the consequences of any such event.
If neither of us enforces any part of these terms, that does not mean that we cannot enforce that part now or in the future.
If there are inconsistencies between the various terms and conditions that make up these terms, the order of precedence will be as follows to resolve those inconsistencies: (1) any order forms; (2)our Data Protection Addendum; (3) the terms set forth in the body of these Terms of Service; (4)our Acceptable Use Policy, includingour service and country specific terms; (5) any other terms and conditions incorporated into these terms; and (6)our published documentation on our website.
9.9 Waiver and Order of Precedence.  No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right or enforcing any provision under this Agreement will constitute a waiver of that right or provision, or any other provision. Titles and headings of sections of this Agreement are for convenience only and will not affect the construction of any provision of this Agreement. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency among the following documents, the order of precedence will be: (1) the applicable Order Form(s), (2) the Twilio Data Protection Addendum, (3) the terms set forth in the body of this Twilio Terms of Service, (4) the Twilio Acceptable Use Policy, (5) any other terms incorporated by reference herein or any other exhibits or attachments hereto, and (6) the applicable Documentation.
If any part of these terms is not legally enforceable, the rest of these terms will still be legally enforceable.
9.10 Severability.  In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary to render such provision enforceable and, in any event, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.
These terms and these terms only govern our relationship with each other and your use of our services. Any terms and conditions outside of these terms will be invalid and not apply.
9.11 Entire Agreement.  This Agreement will constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, proposals, statements, sales materials, presentations, or non-disclosure or other agreements, whether oral or written. No oral or written information or advice given by Twilio, its agents, or its employees will create a warranty or in any way increase the scope of the warranties or obligations in this Agreement.
