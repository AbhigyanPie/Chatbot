Use Trait Activation to configure sync payloads that you send from Engage Audiences and Journeys to a Destination or Destination Function. Map traits from user profiles to Destinations, configure identifiers to sync, and choose a sync strategy that fits your use cases.
Trait Activation includes bothTrait EnrichmentandID Sync. With Trait Enrichment, use custom, SQL, computed, and predictive traits to enrich the data you map to your destinations or destination functions. Use ID Sync to select identifiers and a sync strategy for each identifier when syncing Engage Audiences to Destinations.
To get started with Trait Activation, you’ll need to set up the destination that you’ll use withTrait EnrichmentandID Sync.
Select your destination, view its Segment documentation, then follow the corresponding required setup steps.
Segment recommends creating a new audience for Trait Enrichment and ID Sync. For existing audience destinations, both Trait Enrichment and ID Sync won’t resync the entire audience. Only new data flowing into Segment will adhere to new trait settings.
Contact Segment supportif you’d like your Audience resynced with Trait Enrichment and ID Sync.
For Audiences larger than 50 million users, it may take several hours, or even days, to sync. Only one resync is allowed at a time for each workspace.
Trait Enrichment and ID Sync can help you:
Increase advertising match rates: Expand the pool of users you advertise to and increase match rates by using traits and identifiers to find the right customers.
Include more personalized message content: Include traits in your payload for more up-to-date, accurate data.
Configure how you send identifiers to Destinations: Send the right identifiers to your destinations. For profiles with multiple identifiers, choose a strategy to select identifiers and send them downstream.

Use Trait Enrichment to access Segment profile traits when you sync Audiences and Journeys to Destinations and Destination Functions. With Trait Enrichment, you can use custom, SQL, computed, and predictive traits to enrich the data you map to your destinations.
Use the following steps to set up Trait Enrichment with Audiences or Journeys.
The setup steps you’ll use for Trait Enrichment depend on the type of destinationyou’ve connected.
To set up Trait Enrichment withAudiences:
You can set up Trait Enrichment with Journeys as you’re creating or editing your journey in thebuilder.
Default setup uses default Segment Destination settings without Trait Enrichment. To use the default settings, selectDefault Setup, then clickSaveto resume building your audience or journey.
You can customize event settings at any time.
With Customized setup, you can choose which traits you want to map to your destination or destination function.
Segment sends traits you select for enrichment in thetraitsobject in Identify calls (traits.trait_1,traits.trait_2), and as properties in thepropertiesobject in Track calls (properties.trait_1,properties.trait_2).
Here’s an example Identify call payload with traits in thetraitsobject:
And here’s an example Track call payload with properties in thepropertiesobject:
The following are a list of destination-specific requirements for using Trait Enrichment.
You can only sync the following traits to Facebook:
Each trait you select must map to a Facebook key.
emailis required when syncing to Google, because every payload will sendemail(as an identifier) downstream in addition to phone number.
Additionally, you can only map one trait per audience to Google as a phone number.
If you’re usingDestination ActionsorDestination Functions, use the following steps to set up Trait Enrichment.
After you add traits, configure how your selected traits will map to your destination.
Keep your Engage Audience open in a separate tab, as you’ll need to return.
For best results with Trait Enrichment, Segment recommends:
Trait Enrichmentlets you map the traits data you’ve collected with Engage to use when syncing audiences and Journeys to destinations.
ID Synclets you map the identities data gathered for a profile for use when syncing audiences and Journeys to destinations.
Trait Enrichment on existing audience destinations doesn’t automatically resync the entire audience. Only new data flowing into Segment will adhere to the new trait criteria.
Yes, you can edit mappings in the DestinationMappingstab at any time. However, changes will only take place in subsequent audience syncs or in new audiences connected to the destination.
No. Segment doesn’t guarantee match rate improvements with Trait Enrichment. Match rates depend on data quality.

Twilio Engage provides you with analytics that give you insight into the performance of youremail, SMS, and WhatsApp campaigns.
On this page, you’ll learn how Engage calculates campaign analytics and which messaging metrics you can view.
You’ll find a campaign’s analytics within its parent Journey, using the following instructions:
Understanding when and how Engage measures campaign analytics will help you as you review your analytics reports.
Engage begins tracking campaign performance after you send a campaign. As a result, a campaign’s analytics only reflect conversions that occurred after campaign publication. For example, suppose you send an email campaign promoting a sale in your online store. If a customer purchases a qualifying productbeforereceiving your campaign, their purchase would not count as a conversion.
Clicking on a campaign in a Journey opens a side panel that shows your campaign’s analytics. You can change both the date range and the base percentage type for any campaign.

The date range picker initially inherits the date range set in the campaign’s parent Journey, but you can use the campaign date range picker to define a range for the specific campaign you’re viewing. Changing a campaign’s date range won’t impact the parent Journey’s date range.
By default, Engage bases a campaign’s metrics on the number of sent messages. TheCalculate metrics usingdropdown lets you change this denominator value so that Engage bases analytics on the number of delivered messages. Changing the denominator won’t impact theConvertedmetric, though, since conversions are already based on delivered messages.
The following table lists the email campaign metrics that Engage tracks:
SendGrid powers Engage’s email campaign event analytics. For more details on email metrics, view SendGrid’sMarketing Campaigns Statistics Overview.
Machine opens occur when an email client automatically opens an email, giving the impression that a user opened your email even if they haven’t.
Segment tracks machine opens and subtracts them from the total number of opened emails. Segment displays this number in theTrue Openedtile, which gives a more reliable count of how many real users opened your campaign.
Hover over theTrue Openedtile for any campaign to see a full comparison of machine opens and true opens.

Engage provides a complete, up-to-date view of your users customer journey as it unfolds, and one of the best ways to understand the data produced by this journey is by analyzing the data in your data warehouse using SQL.
With Engage, you can send Computed Traits and Audiences to a data warehouse like Redshift, BigQuery, or Snowflake. This allows you to perform analysis and reporting around key customer audiences and campaigns, as well set up your user data as input into predictive models.
Segment makes it easy to load your customer profile data into a clean schema, so your analysts can help answer some of your toughest business questions.
When you build an audience or computed trait, you can configure it to send an identify call or a track call to your data warehouse, and additionally include mobile ids.

If you chose to send your Engage data as an identify call, Engage usually sends one call per user.
When you sendaudiencesas an identify call, Engage includes a boolean trait that matches the audience name. When a user enters an audience the boolean is set totrue, and when they exit, the boolean is set tofalse.
In the example below, you can see that theidentifypayload includes a trait of the audiencefirst_time_shopperwith the value oftrue.
When you sendcomputed traitsas an identify call, Engage sends a similar call with the computed value for that trait. In the example below, the traittotal_revenue_180_daysincludes the calculated value of450.00.
Engage identify calls appear in your warehouse using a similar format as normal Connections identify calls. Identify calls appear in two tables per Engage space. These tables are named with a prefix ofengage_, then the Engage space name, followed byidentifiesorusers. Theidentifiestable contains a record of every identify call, and theuserstable contains one record peruser_idwith the most recent value.
Theengage_schema name is specific to the Engage space and cannot be modified. Additional audiences and computed traits appear as additional columns in these tables.
engage_default.identifies
engage_default.users
When you sendaudiencesusing track calls, Engage sends anAudience Enteredevent when a user enters, and anAudience Exitedevent when the user exits, by default. These event names are configurable.
Engage also sends two event properties about the audience: theaudience_key, which records the name of the audience that the event modifies, and the audience name and its value, as a separate key and value pair. The value of the audience key is populated with a boolean value.
In the example below, you can see that theaudience_keyis set to record a modification to thefirst_time_shopperaudience, and thefirst_time_shoppervalue is set totrue.
When you sendcomputed traits, Engage sends aTrait Computedevent that records which computed trait it updates, then records the updated key and value. You can also customize this event name.

In the example below, the Trait Computed event contains thetrait_keywhich records which computed trait is being modified, and then includes the keytotal_revenue_180_dayswith the updated value of450.00.
Similar to track calls in Connections, Engage track calls appear in your warehouse as one table per event name. For example, if you configure your events calledAudience Entered,Audience Exited, andTrait Computed, Engage would create tables like the following examples in your warehouse:
engage_default.audience_entered
engage_default.audience_exited
engage_default.trait_computed
The users table is an aggregate view based on theuser_idfield. This means that anonymous profiles with just ananonymous_ididentifier aren’t included in this view. You can still view identify calls for anonymous audiences and computed traits in theidentifiestable.
The users table is synced as soon as the warehouse is connected as a destination in Engage, if you’ve previously created Engage computations. As a result, the table might contain data from computations not directly connected to the warehouse.
Although Engage can compute audiences and traits in real-time, these calculations are subject to the sync schedule allowed by your warehouses plan, which is usually hourly. You can check the warehouse sync history to see details about past and upcoming syncs. When you look at the sync schedule, sources with theengage_prefix sync data from Engage.
Yes. You can useWarehouses Selective Syncto manage which traits, audiences, and tables get synced from Engage.
Segment can only connect a source to one instance of each destination. For example, one source cannot send to two different Amplitude instances. As a workaround, Engage creates multiple sources to send events to the destinations connected to your space.
For example, if you have three webhook destinations in your space, Engage creates three different sources to send events to them. This creates three different warehouse schemas, and is usually the reason you have more schemas than spaces.
This approach doesn’t apply to messaging destinations, however. Messaging destinations connected from journeys and broadcasts don’t generate multiple background sources.

You can send your Computed Traits and Audiences to your Segment Destinations, which allows you to personalize messages across channels, optimize ad spend, and improve targeting. This page provides an overview of different ways to activate Engage data in Segment Destinations.
You can also use theProfile APIto activate Engage data programmatically.
There are two ways to send data to Engage Destinations: asEventsand asLists.
Event Destinationsreceive data one by one, on a streaming basis asevents, which are behaviors or traits tied to a user and a point in time. Every time a piece of data (such as a track event or identify call) is received in Segment — for example, from your website or your mobile app — Segment then sends this piece of data to the Destination right away.
List Destinationsperiodically receive data in batches, and these batches contain lists of users. In most cases, Segment sends data to a list destination every hour, and sends all data accumulated since the last batch was sent.
Some Destinations, such as Salesforce Marketing Cloud have both “event” and “list” destination types that you can use.
Engage sends computed traits and audiences to destinations in different ways depending on whether the destination is an Event or List type:
Computed Traitsare always sent to Event destinations either using an identify call for user traits, a group call for account-level computed traits, or a track event.
WithAudiences, Engage sends the audience either as a boolean (true or false)user propertyto Event Destinations, or as auser listto List Destinations. If you are a B2B company creating account audiences (where each account represents a group of users, like employees at a business) and sending them to list destinations, Engage sends the list of all users within an account that satisfies the audience criteria.
Event Destinations and Computed traitsComputed traits can only be sent to Event destinations.
When Engage sends a computed trait to an Event destination, it uses an identify call to send user traits, or a group call to send account-level computed traits.
Event Destinations and Audiences
Segment sends an identify or track call for every user in the audience when the audience is first created. Later syncs only send updates for those users who were added or removed from the audience since the last sync.
Most destinations require that you configure a column in your schema to receive the audience data, however, some destinations (like Braze and Iterable) allow you to send audiences without doing this. This depends on the individual destination, so consult the destination’s documentation for details.
List destinations can only receive Audiences, and cannot receive computed traits.
When syncing to a list destination Engage uploads lists of users directly to the destination. When you first create an audience, Segment uploads the entire list of audience users to the destination. Later syncs only upload the users that have been added or removed since the last sync.
User-list destinations can have individual limits on how often Segment can sync with them. For example, an AdWords audience is updated once every six hours or more, because that’s what AdWords recommends.
The payloads sent from your Engage space to your destinations will be different depending on if you configured the destination to receive identify or track calls, and whether the payload is coming from a computed trait or audience. As a reminder, identify calls usually update a trait on a user profile or table, whereas track calls send a point-in-time event that can be used as a campaign trigger or a detailed record of when a user’s audience membership or computed trait value was calculated.
To view the events generated by an Engage Space’s audience or computed traits, navigate toUnify settings > Debuggerand view the list of sources that are configured to generate events pereach destination instance. Each source will only generate events to connected destinations. From the source’s Debugger tab, you’ll find the most recent events generated by that source per the connected destinations’ audiences and computed traits.
In the full json body of an audience, computed trait, or journey, you’ll find specific details under thecontext.personasobject. These fields can be useful when building outDestination Filters,Actions destination mappings, andFunctions.
The integrations object in the payload displays as{"All" : false,}and only lists some destinations. This is due to the fact that each source has multiple destinations connected while each audience/trait may only have a subset of destinations connected to it. SeeFiltering with the Integrations Objectfor more information. The integrations object routing specific events to its specified destinations is also why a destination’sDelivery Overviewtab will show a large number of events under theFiltered at destinationbox, as that destination will only receive the events intended to be sent to it by audiences, traits, or journeys that are connected to that specific destination.
Identifyevents generated by a Computed Trait have the trait name set to the Computed Trait value:
Trackevents generated by a Computed Trait have a key for the trait name, and a key for the Computed Trait value. The default event name isTrait Computed, but you can change it.
Engage only sends events to the destination if the Computed Trait value has changed for the user. Engage doesn’t send a payload for every user in your trait every time the trait computes.
Identifyevents generated by an Audience have the Audience key set totrueorfalsebased on whether the user is entering or exiting the audience:
Trackevents generated by an Audience have a key for the Audience name, and for the Audience value:
The data type you send to a destination depends on whether the destination is an event destination or a list destination. For more information, read theJourneys documentationon how Journeys Identity and Track event payloads get formatted when sending to Event destinations.
Seethis docfor more information on Journeys events.Trackevents generated by a journey have a key for the journey name “audience_key”, and a key for the journey value:
Identifyevents generated by a Journey have the Journey key set totrueorfalsebased on whether the user is entering or exiting the Journey:
Engage has a flexible identity resolution layer that allows you to build user profiles based on multiple identifiers likeuser_id,email, ormobile advertisingId. However, different destinations may require different keys, so they can do their own matching and identification. For example, Zendesk requires that you include thenameproperty.
Engage includes logic to automatically enrich payloads going to these destinations with the required keys.
If you send events to a destination that requires specific enrichment Segment doesn’t already include, you can useID SyncorTrait Enrichmentto send additional data points to the destination.
Profiles with multiple identifiers (for example,user_idandemail) will trigger one API call per identifier when the audience or computed trait is first synced to a destination.
Email as an identifier is set intraits.emailfor Identify calls, andcontext.traits.emailfor Track calls.
You might also see that profiles that have multiple values for the sameexternal_idtype, for example a profile might have multiple email addresses. When this happens, Engage sends one event per email for each audience or computed trait event. This ensures that all downstream email-based profiles receive the complete audience or computed trait.
In some situations, this behavior might cause an unexpected volume of API calls. You can useID Syncto establish a strategy and control the number of events sent.
There are two situations when Engage sends an audience or computed trait to a destination.
The first is when the value of the trait or audience changes.
The second, less common case is that Engage re-syncs an audience or computed trait when a newexternal_idis added to a profile. For example, an ecommerce company has an anonymous visitor with a computed trait calledlast_viewed_category = 'Shoes'. That visitor then creates an account and an email address is added to that profile, even though the computed trait value hasn’t changed. When that email address is added to the profile, Engage re-syncs the computed trait that includes an email to downstream tools. This allows the ecommerce company to start personalizing the user’s experience from a more complete profile.
For more granular control that lets you specify which external IDs Segment sends to a destination, see theID Sync documentation.
Many Destinations have strict rate limits that prevent Segment (and other partners) from sending too much data to a Destination at one time. Engage caps the number of requests per second to certain Destinations to avoid triggering rate limits that would cause data to be dropped. The most common scenario when customers run into rate-limits is when Engage first tries to sync a large set of historical users. Once this initial sync is done, we rarely run into rate-limit issues.
For additional information on Destination-specific rate limits, check the documentation for that Destination. If you need a higher rate limit,let Segment knowwhich Destination you need it for and why.
When you create a new Computed Trait or Audience in Engage, you can choose to calculate it either using all the available historical data from your Segment implementation, or only using data that arrives after you set up the trait or audience. By default, Segment opts to include historical data. Afterwards, Segment only sends updates to that destination.
Why would I disable historical data?You might want to disable historical data if you’re sending a triggered campaign. For example, if you want to send an email confirming a purchase, youprobablydon’t want to email users who bought something months ago, but youdowant to target current users as they make purchases (and thus enter the audience).
The Facebook Custom Audiences Website destination does not accept historical data, and so only uses data from after the moment you configure it.
Use theEngage settingsto add a destination to your Engage space.
Connect any Cloud-mode destination that supports Identify or Track calls to Engage as an event type destination.

Yes. You can learn more about the Audience API by visiting theSegment Public API documentation.
Yes. Because Engage creates a trait with the same name as your audience, you can query the Profile API to determine if a user belongs to a particular audience. For example, to determine if the user with an email address ofbob@example.comis a member of yourhigh_value_usersaudience, you could query the following Profile API URL:
The following response indicates that Bob is a high-value user:
For more information on profile queries, visit theProfile API documentation.
You can’t change the audience key after it’s created. To change the key, you need to re-create the audience.
Avoid using the same audience key twice, even if you’ve deleted the key’s original audience. Downstream tools and destinations might have trouble distinguishing between different audiences that once shared the same key. This may create mismatch in audience size between Segment and the destination because the destination may count users of the old audience, resulting in a larger audience size.
Engage allows you to compute new traits and audiences of your users based on their entire customer journey, and all historical data you’ve tracked with Segment.
When you create a new computed trait or audience, you include a lookback window that determines how far back into the past the trait or audiences will be computed.

Some important things to keep in mind when setting a lookback window:
Historical lookback windows are based on the eventtimestampfield.
Lookback windows are precise down to the hour, so a 90-day lookback window will include any events with atimestamptimestamp within the last 2,160 hours (24 hr/day * 90 days).
The trait and audience will automatically update going forward as historical events exceed the lookback window.
Funnel Audiences allow you to usestrict, relative orderingfor your audience conditions. Common use cases for these audiences are Cart Abandonment (users that triggered the Product Added event but did not trigger the Order Completed event after the Product Added event occurred) and onboarding steps (users that Added Credit Card but did not Subscribe afterward).

Audiences > New > Select Funnel Condition(“and then did not”/”and then did”)
The funnel condition will now be relative to the parent condition.
The audience in the image below includes all users that have Product Added in the last week, but not Order Completed within a day of doing so.

Funnel Audiences compute based on all instances of the parent event within the lookback period. This means that if you have a user that Product Added ⟶ Order Completed ⟶ Product Added, this user would be entered into the Abandoned Cart state despite having previously completed an order.
Engage’s merge protection algorithm protects your identity graph from unnecessary merges by finding and removing untrusted external IDs. Here’s an example:

In this example,anonymous_id: a1is not reset during aUser Logout. Without merge protection rules, Segment would mergeuser_id u1anduser_id u2. Instead, the identity resolution algorithm detects that such a merge would breakuser_iduniqueness and prevents the merge.
This is especially helpful for preventing “blob users” that are merged together by non-unique anonymous IDs or by common group emails liketeam@company.com.
Most destinations on the Segment Platform are built up around a user model. They assume that a user will have a single userId. Further, most Destinations are not built to handle anonymous traffic.
By default, Segment doesn’t sync the output of the Identity Graph to Destinations. However, Segment computed traits and audiences are based on the entire user profile, including anonymous and merged data. Segment syncs the value of these computations (for example,blog_posts_ready_30_days: 10) using alluserIdson the profile.
For Destinations that support analiascall (for example, Mixpanel), you can emit analiascall on merge.
The following list shows just some data sources you can sync to Engage:
Yes, Engage supports the ability to send an audience or computed trait to two or more accounts of the same partner. The most common use case is multiple Facebook, or Adwords ad accounts.
An audience/computed trait run or sync may fail on its first attempt, but Engage will retry up to five times before considering it a hard failure that displays on the audience/compute trait’s overview page. As long as the runs/syncs within the specific audience’s overview page indicate success, you can ignore any failure alerts.
How things work internally:Segment’s Engage scheduler fetches audiences/traits from the compute service and then handles the logic of generating tasks. These compute/sync tasks get scheduled and executed by another worker. These tasks are a list of steps to be executed. Each task has a series of steps that Segment marks as complete by saving a timestamp for the completion. If something disrupts the worker, it picks up at the latest step without acompleted_attimestamp. In some cases, the step or entire task might fail due to timeout or worker disruption. No matter the cause, Segment will retry any failures.
The audit trail’s configuration notifies about every task failure, even if the failure later succeeds. In most cases, you won’t need to track these failures, unless you notice actual computation or sync failures.
If you don’t want to receive notifications for temporary failures,reach out to support. Upon request, Segment can disable temporary failure notifications, which will reduce the number of notifications your workspace receives.
Each step of a Journey is an Engage audience under the hood. The conditions stack, so a user must be a member of the previous step (audience) and meet all conditions to be added to subsequent steps. However, if the user no longer meets entry conditions for a particular step, they’ll exit and you’ll see the user count reduced. For any subsequent steps a user is still a part of, they’ll remain until they no longer meet entry conditions.
Multiple audience events can trigger for a user if any of the following conditions occur:
1) There is a merge on the user.
2) Anexternal_idwas added to the profile.
3) The user hasmultiple identifiers of the same type. Segment sends one event per identifier for each audience or computed trait event.
4) Theinclude anonymous usersoption is selected for an audience. Segment sends an event for everyanonymousIdon the user profile.
Based on Engage behavior, standard source events such as Page, Track and Identify calls aren’t visible on the Engage source. The Engage source tracks and manages events related to audiences and computed traits within the Engage space. This includes events generated by changes in audience membership or computed trait calculations or when a user profile has been created in the Engage space. These are distinct from the typical Page calls, Track calls, or Identify calls (user interaction events) that you would observe in a standard Segment source.
Engage will not allow you to connect an audience/computed trait to a destination that is already linked to aConnections-based source. Instead, create a new instance of the destination with the correct Engage space selected as the data source.
The “5 most common values” are the most frequently observed values for a given trait across all users, not tied to any individual user.

Paragraphs:
Privacy Portal is available for the listed account plans only.See theavailable plans, orcontact Support.
On this page
When preparing for new privacy regulations (like HIPAA, the GDPR, or the CCPA), the
best practice is to create a comprehensive data inventory which includes details
about what personal information you collect, where you collect it from, where
you store the data, and who has access to it. The Privacy Portal helps automate
this process for the data you collect with Segment.
When you use Segment as the single point of collection for your customer data, you can use the Privacy Portal to:
Privacy Portal features are available to all Segment workspaces, however only workspace owners can access the Privacy Portal.
The Detection page in the Privacy Portal is where you can find out more about
exactly how data is being detected and classified in your workspace. You can
think of it as the brain behind the entire Privacy Portal, filled with the logic
that detects and classifies the data in the first place.
On this page, you can also modify your Detection settings andtell Segment how you want us to match data, so that it is meets your unique business needs.
Out of the box, the Privacy Portal contains matchers for the most common PII
fields. These matchers scan data coming from your Sources for PII based on both
exact-matching (looking for an exact match, such as a field name) and
fuzzy-matching (looking for both exact matches, and any values which are
similar).
In this section of Segment’s Privacy Portal, you can see the fields we match
against by default. The display lists whether we match on the key (for example
the label “CCN”) or value (for example, the payload 123-456-7890) in theMatches Oncolumn. You can also see how we classify these matchers by
default in theDefault Classificationcolumn.
Below is a full list of automatically detected restricted fields.
When Segment detects data that meets the criteria for one of the default
matchers (in the list above) in properties in your Web, Mobile, Server, or Cloud
Event Sources, we display it in thePrivacy Portal Inbox.
Default PII matchers are currently uneditable. If you want to change the behavior of a default matcher, you can create a custom PII matcher that replicates and overwrites the default matcher.
This is where you can create your very own matchers to tell Segment what to scan
for in your workspace. You can use this feature to detect properties that are
unique to your company or region, or that aren’t already handled by the default
matchers above. You can have up to 100 custom matchers per workspace. Custom
Matchers detect data in your Web, Mobile, Server, and Cloud Event Sources for 
fields undercontext,traitsandpropertiesobjects, and
the data they detect appears in the Inbox.
For example, if you have a restricted data point at your company called “SIN”
(for “social insurance number”) you can tell Segment’s Privacy Portal how to
treat that property whenever it is appears in data Segment processes.
To create a Custom Matcher:


Unless the field value pattern is unique, we recommend matching on the Key. For
example, for Credit Card Number, it’s better to detect on Keys that look like
“CCN” or “Credit Card Number” instead of trying to detect any values that look
like “1234567890”, because a 10-digit string can be found in all kinds of data
even when it’s not an CCN. For example, the key “Product_ID” could contain a
10-digit string, even though Product_ID does not actually contain an SSN. A
North American phone number (without country code) is also ten digits.
Use Access Roles to control who has access to the PII identified by your matchers.
Custom Matchers useregular expressions(using theGolang Regex Package) to provide you great flexibility for your matching patterns.
Regular expressions (or regexes) are a way to describe to a computer a pattern
that we’re looking for, using a series of special symbols. For example, if we
want to match all Gmail emails, we’d write the following regex:
This pattern matchesjane@example.com,mike@example.comand so on. Regular
expressions can also contain special symbols. One of them is\dand it tells
the computer to match a single-digit number. In that case, regular expressionNumber \dwould matchNumber 1,Number 2and so on. You can match multiple
digits by adding a plus sign (+) at the end:Year \d+. This pattern would
matchYear 2019,Year 2020, etc.
If you need to match a specific word, you can type the word without any
modifiers. For example, a regular expression ofApplewould only match strings
that containApple. You can also change it to match allAppleorOrangewords, by separating the search terms with a “pipe” character, like so:Apple|Orange.
Regular expressions have much more flexibility than we can describe here. Check
out the following resources to learn more about regular expressions so you can
build new custom matchers:
Segment’s exact matching and fuzzy matching do not detect all variations in the received keys
and for those scenarios, you can use synonyms.  For example, for the valuecredit card number, you can addcredit card no,debit card number,debit card no, or similar variations in the synonyms section to classify those fields.
The Inbox helps you keep track of new restricted data types as they are captured, quickly classify them, and build a data Inventory.
Segment detects these fields by scanning data from your Web, Mobile, Server, and Cloud Event Sources to detect PII based on thedefault PII matchers. New properties sent into Segment appear in the Inbox in realtime.
When you view the Inbox, it displays every property that was sent into Segment from Web, Mobile, Server, and Cloud Event Sources for the past 7 days. (Object Cloud SourcesandReverse ETL Sourcesdo not appear in the Inbox at this time.)
You can click a row in the Inbox to learn more about a field and where it was collected. The expanded view shows:

To streamline the classification process, Segment pre-classifies the data in the
Privacy Portal Inbox asRed(likely highly restricted data),Yellow(likely moderately restricted data), andGreen(likely least restricted
data). These colors indicate how restricted the data is for your business. You
can also send and block data from flowing based on its color classification and
how restricted it is.
Segment makes recommendations about how a field should be classified using
built-in PII matcherdetection, however, you can always
update the classification in the Inbox based on your company’s requirements.
You can update the classifications to suit your needs by clicking on the color
dropdown menu to change. For example, you might manually change a field that
does not contain personal information in your implementation from a “Yellow”
classification to “Green.”

When you’re satisfied that the fields have been classified appropriately, you
can clickAdd to Inventoryto officially apply the classification to the
field. This moves the field into yourData Inventory,
which is a central repository of all of the propertiesyouclassified as Red,
Yellow, and Green. Any time you send this field from a Web, Mobile, Server, or
Cloud Event Source — whether from another Source or event type — the Privacy
Portal automatically classifies it and adds it to the Inventory.
Red Classification:
Fields that are classified as ‘Red’ are masked for users that do not have PII Access enabled. These fields are also blocked if you have set Standard Controls under Privacy > Settings section.
Keep in mind that if you have set Standard Controls to block fields from any of your sources, any new classifications you create in the Inbox will start to take affect immediately. For example, if you have a Privacy Control set up to blockReddata from your Android source, any new fields you classify in the Inbox asRedwill be blocked from entering Segment from your Android source.
Yellow Classification:
Fields that are classified as ‘Yellow’ are masked for users that do not have PII Access enabled.
Green Classification:
Classifying a field as ‘Green’ does not have any impact on the behavior of masking of fields within the Segment App, it is only available for the housekeeping purposes.
Once a field has been classified as “Yellow” or “Red”, marking it “Green” will not make it visible for users that don’t have PII access.
The Inventory is a central repository of all of the propertiesyouclassified as Red, Yellow, and Green. Where theInboxshows new, unclassified data with Segment’srecommendedclassifications, the Inventory only contains data that you explicitly applied Classifications to.
The Inventory is intended to be a Single Source of Truth so you can answer common regulatory questions about the data you’re sending through Segment, for example:
Once you’ve classified the fields as Red, Yellow, and Green in the Inbox, the classified fields appear in the Inventory. You can use the filter at the top left to filter down to specific categories of data (for example, Red data, data from a production environment, data from specific sources).

Click into a field (for example,ip) in the Inventory to open the Inventory
details. The details sheet displays how many times a specific field has been
sent from each Source it comes from. You can click the Events tab to see which
events contained the event, along with the Sources which sent the event. The
data in the side sheet updates in realtime, and includes a limited historical
view.
You can clickConnected Destinationsto see which Destinations are
connected to the Source that contains the field. The Access tab displays a list
of who within your organization has access to this field.

Finally, workspace owners can use theDownload CSVbutton to export a CSV of
their data Inventory to share with their Data Protection Officer (DPO), Chief
Information Security Officer (CISO), legal teams, and more! Note that the CSV
download button includesalldata from your Inventory, and ignores any filters
you applied in the UI.

The Privacy Portal gives you control over whether specific data is allowed to
enter Segment.
The controls are available to all customers, across all plan types. With
these, you can block data at the source level, which means
data from those sources never enters Segment once blocked. This does not support blocking to device-mode destinations.
For example, if you want to prevent certain types of PII (like Credit Card
Number) from ever being ingested by Segment, you can block it using standard
controls by classifying those fields as “Red” in your Data Inventory,
and then blocking them in your standard controls settings. Blocking fields
blocks the properties from entering Segment, but does not block the rest of the
event data from flowing through. Remember that any data you classify as “Red” in your Data Inventory is
blocked if you enable these controls.
If you block Segment data at the source level using these controls, the data
does not enter Segment and we can not Replay it. Additionally, if you have
Privacy Controls configured to change how you route Red and
Yellow data into or out of Segment, the standard controls respect the rules set
by those Controls. For example, if you have a Privacy Control set up to blockReddata at the Source-level, any new fields you classify in the Data Inventory asRedare also blocked from that Source. Only fields added to the Data Inventory are blocked by a Privacy Control.
Alerts notify you when a new, unclassified data type appears in your Privacy
Portal inbox. You can set up Slack alerts or a generic Source to pipe alerts to
other tools you might prefer for events and notifications. We recommend setting
up alerts to help you ensure your Inventory is always up to date.

On May 25, 2018 businesses faced the greatest regulatory change in data privacy policy since the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive was enacted: theEU General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR). The European Union began enforcing the GDPR on May 25, 2018 in an effort to strengthen the security and protection of personal data of EU residents.
In keeping with Segment’s ongoing commitment to privacy and security, Segment updated its practices to be GDPR compliant before the May 25, 2018, enforcement date. But that’s not all. As the central record for your customer data, Segment is also committed to making it easier for you to comply with the GDPR.
Specifically, here is how Segment supports its customers:
An updated Data Protection Addendum (DPA) to reflect the requirements of the GDPR and to ensure compliant data transfer with storage outside the EU. Existing customers can enter into the updated Data Protection Addendum usingthe opt-in process.
New product capabilities to help you be compliant when users request you delete or suppress their data.
Check out Segment’sGDPR blog postto learn about Segment’s plan for GDPR readiness.
The GDPR has different requirements depending on how your business interacts with personal data. Companies can be data controllers, data processors, or, in some cases, both a controller and a processor. Data controllers are businesses that collect their end users’ data and decide why and how that data is processed. On Segment’smarketing website, for example, Segment is considered adata controller. As a vendor, however, the more meaningful way Segment is impacted by the GDPR is as adata processor, as Segment is a company that helps its customers with the processing of their customer data.
In addition to damaging your customers’ trust, failure to comply with the GDPR can result in fines of €20 million or 4% of global annual turnover for the previous year (whichever is greater).
What are your responsibilities as a data controller?
If you collect data about EU residents and decide why and how those data are collected and processed, you may be considered adata controllerunder the GDPR. Data controllers are responsible for implementing adequate technical, organizational, and operational measures to ensure and demonstrate that all data collection and processing is performed in accordance with the GDPR, including entering into a relevant data processing agreement. Moreover, you must fulfill data subjects’ rights with respect to their data along the following principles:
Segment recommends reading the full text of theGDPRto better understand these rights and seeking independent legal advice regarding your obligations under the GDPR. You can also check out publications by data privacy associations such as theInternational Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP)for the latest news.
In addition to seeking independent legal advice regarding your obligations under the GDPR, here are some tips to get you started:
Educate yourself on the provisions of theGDPRto understand how they may differ from your existing data protection obligations and practices.
If you don’t have dedicated data privacy or security personnel in-house, consider appointing a directly responsible individual (DRI) or small team to manage your company’s GDPR compliance efforts.
Create an up-to-date inventory of personal data that you collect and manage. -
For data flowing through Segment, you can start with the Overview page in your workspace to understand where you are collecting (Sources) and routing (Destinations) customer data. Next, visit the Schema page within each of your Sources to understand the type of data you’re sending to Segment.
Be sure to consider the data that is not flowing through Segment. You’ll need to make sure the same bar for compliance is met across your organization.
Create a list of vendors who you send data to (analytics tools, CRMs, email tools, etc.), and understand whether they are a controller or a processor. Then, determine what their obligations are, and make sure they have a plan to be ready for the GDPR.
Develop a plan for obtaining and managingconsentin accordance with the GDPR or establish other lawful grounds for using personal data.
Determine if your company needs to appoint aData Protection Officer(DPO). If you will be appointing a DPO, begin searching for the best person for the role.
Becoming GDPR compliant takes time, and will require you to rethink how you collect and manage customer data. If you have any questions about the GDPR or want to learn how Segment can help you prepare,let us know!
Segment offers a Data Protection Addendum (DPA) and Standard Contractual (SCCs) as a means of meeting contractual requirements of applicable data privacy laws and regulations, such as GDPR, and to address international data transfers. Segment’s onlineData Protection Addendum(DPA) is already part of and incorporated into theTerms of Service. If you have a separate written agreement with Segment that does not include a Data Protection Addendum (DPA) or you would like to replace the existing Data Protection Addendum (DPA) that is attached to your separate written agreement with Segment’s latest Data Protection Addendum (DPA), please contact your account team orcustomer support.
Segment offers a Data Protection Addendum (DPA) and Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) as a means of meeting the regulatory contractual requirements of GDPR in its role as processor and also to address international data transfers.
Note on Schrems II: Despite the CJEU’s July 2020 ruling invalidating Privacy Shield as a means of validly transferring data to the USA from the EU, these developments are not expected to disrupt Segment’s ability to provide services to its EU customers as the European Court of Justice has reaffirmed that the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) remain valid as a method of transfer. Segment’s standard Data Protection Addendum includes a provision whereby should Privacy Shield ever be invalidated (as is the case now) then the SCCs will automatically apply.

Paragraphs:
On this page
In keeping with Segment’s commitment to GDPR and CCPA readiness, Segment offers the ability to delete and suppress data about end-users when they are identifiable by auserId, should they revoke or alter consent to data collection. For example, if an end-user invokes the Right to Object or Right to Erasure under the GDPR or CCPA, you can use these features to block ongoing data collection about that user and delete all historical data about them from Segment’s systems, connected S3 buckets and warehouses, and supported downstream partners.
Contact Supportif you need to process more than 110,000 users within a 30 day period.
Business Plan Customers
If you use this feature to delete data, you can not Replay the deleted data. For standard Replay requests, you must wait for any pending deletions to complete, and you cannot submit new deletion requests for the period of time that Segment replays data for you.
The legacy GraphQL APIs for user deletion and suppression are deprecated. Instead, use theSegment Public APIto interact with the User Deletion and Suppression system.
All deletion and suppression actions in Segment are asynchronous and categorized as Regulations. Regulations are requests to Segment to control your data flow. You can issue Regulations from:
You can programmatically interact with the User Deletion and Suppression system using thePublic API.
With Regulations, you can issue a single request to delete and suppress data about a user byuserId. Segment scopes Regulations to your workspace (which targets all sources within the workspace), to a specific source, or to a cloud source.
The following regulation types are available:
UsingSUPPRESS_WITH_DELETEorDELETE_ONLYregulation types might lead to additional charges levied by your destination providers.
SUPPRESSregulations add a user to your suppression list by theuserId. Segment blocks suppressed users across all sources; messages you send to Segment with a suppresseduserIdare blocked at the API. These messages do not appear in the debugger, are not saved in archives and systems, and are not sent to any downstream server-side destinations. However, if you set up a destination indevice-mode, the events are sent directly to destinations as well. In this case, Suppression doesn’t suppress the events.
When a customer exercises the right to erasure, they expect that you stop collecting data about them. Suppression regulations ensure that regardless of how you’re sending data to Segment, if a user opts out, Segment respects their wishes on an ongoing basis and across applications.
Suppression is not a substitute for gathering affirmative, unambiguous consent about data collection and its uses.
Segment offers suppression tools to help you manage the challenge of users opting-out across different channels and platforms. Segment encourages and expects that you design your systems and applications so you don’t collect or forward data to Segment until you have unambiguous, specific, informed consent or have established another lawful legal basis to do so.
To remove a user from the suppression list, create anUNSUPPRESSregulation.
When you create aSUPPRESS_WITH_DELETEregulation, the user is actively suppressed, and Segment begins permanently deleting all data associated with this user from your workspace. This includes scanning and removing all messages related to thatuserIdfrom all storage mediums that don’t automatically expire data within 30 days, including archives, databases, and intermediary stores.
Segment deletes messages with thisuserIdfrom connected raw data Destinations, including Redshift, BigQuery, Postgres, Snowflake, and Amazon S3. Warehouse deletions occur using a DML run against your cluster or instance, and Segment delete from S3 by “recopying” clean versions of any files in your bucket that included data about thatuserId.
Segment forwards these deletion requests to agrowing list of supported partners.
Note that Segment has a 30-day SLA for submitted deletion requests. Additionally, Segment’s deletion manager can only accommodate 110,000 users within a 30-day period and cannot guarantee a 30-day SLA if there are more than 110,000 deletion requests submitted within those 30 days. You can delete up to 5000userIds per call via Public API.Contact Supportif you need to process more than 110,000 users within a 30 day period.
Segment cannot guarantee that data is deleted from your Destinations.
Segment forwards deletion requests tosupported Destinations(such as Braze, Intercom, and Amplitude) but you should confirm that each partner fulfills the request.
You will also need to contact any unsupported Destinations separately to manage user data deletion.
Note that if you laterUNSUPPRESSa user, the deletion functionality does not clean up data sent after removing the user from the suppression list.
The Suppressed Users tab in Segment App (Settings > End User Privacy) allows you to create new Suppression requests and also shows an list ofuserIds which areactivelybeing suppressed. It can take a few hours/days for the suppression to become active, depending on the number of requests that are in the queue for your workspace. Once the request is active, Segment blocks data about these users across all sources.
Note that list only includesSUPPRESS_ONLYregulations. If you created a User Deletion request using UI, you will need to check theDeletion Requeststab, as those areSUPPRESS_WITH_DELETEregulation types.
To create a suppression regulation and add auserIdto this list, clickSuppress New User, and enter theuserIdin the field that appears. Then clickRequest Suppression.
Segment creates aSUPPRESSregulation, and adds theuserIdto your suppression list, mostly processed within 24 hours. In some cases, the suppression request can take up to 30 days to process. You can suppress up to 5000 userIds per call through the Public API.
To remove a user from the suppression list, click the ellipses (…) icon on theuserIdrow, and clickRemove.
This creates anUNSUPPRESSregulation, and removes theuserIdfrom your suppression list, mostly processed within 24 hours.
The deletion requests tab shows a log of all regulations with a deletion element along with status. The deletion requests can take up to 30 days to process.
In the Segment App (Settings > End User Privacy > Deletion Requests), you can click a userId to view its status in Segment internal systems, and in the connected destinations.
The deletion request can have one of the following statuses:
When checking the status of deletion requests using Segment’s API, the deletion will report an overall status of all of the deletion processes. As a result, Segment returns aFAILEDstatus because of a failure on an unsupported destination, even if the deletion from the Segment Internal Systems and supported destinations were completed successfully.
Refer toCreate Source Regulationin the Public API.
Refer to theCreate Cloud Source RegulationPublic API endpoint.
Cloud Sources sync objects to Segment. As a result, Cloud Sources are regulated based on anobjectIdinstead of auserId.
Before you delete the object from Segment, you should delete it from the upstream system first.
Refer toList Suppressionsmethod in the Public API.
Refer to theList Regulations from SourcePublic API method.
Segment stores a copy of all event data received in Segment’s secure event archives on S3. By default, all workspaces store data for an unlimited period of time, but you can modify the lifecycle policies for the data stored internally. Segment uses this data fordata replaysand for troubleshooting purposes.

Paragraphs:
Consent Management is available to customers on Business tier plans.See theavailable plans, orcontact Support.
When an end user visits your web or mobile app, they setconsent preferences, or make decisions about the types of data they want you to collect, use, and share. These consent preferences are typically presented as a set list of categories that describe how your company intends to use that data. Some common categories include personalization, advertising, and site performance.
Segment integrates with your commercial third-party or bespoke consent management platform (CMP) that captures an end user’s consent preferences and enforces those preferences by only routing events to the categories consented to by an end user.

After a user sets their consent preferences on your web or mobile app, Segment requires you to add theconsent objectto all events. If you are using OneTrust, Segment provides a wrapper for your web and mobile libraries that can add the consent object to your events. If you are using another CMP, you are required to add the consent object to your events by either creating your own wrapper or using another mechanism. For more information, see theConfigure Consent Management documentation.
The events, stamped with the consent object, are then sent downstream to any destinations in categories that an end user consented to share data with.
Segment collects consent for both registered users and anonymous users.
For more information about consent in Segment Connections, see theConsent in Segment Connectionsdocumentation.
If you are a Unify user, you can also see theConsent in Unifyfor more information about the Segment Consent Preference Updated event, which Segment uses to add consent preference to the Profile.

Segment Connections users can add theconsent objectto their sources to stamp events with the end user consent preferences captured by your consent management platform (CMP) and send them downstream to destinations in categories that an end user consented to share data with. Events without the consent object continue to flow to destinations without consent enforcement.
With theDestination Actions framework, you can send current end user consent preferences to flow to your destination alongside customer interactions so your destinations know when an end user revokes their consent.
For more information about sharing current end user consent preferences with your downstream destinations, see theSharing consent with Actions destinationsdocumentation.
For more information about configuring consent categories, see theConfigure Consent Managementdocumentation.
If your sources also contain the integrations object, Segment will look at the consent object first, and then take into account the integrations object according to the table in theReconcile consent object and integrations objectdocumentation.
Unify users must send an additional event to add consent preferences to Profiles
If you use Unify, see theConsent in Unifydocumentation for more information about the Segment Consent Preference Updated event, which Segment uses with the consent object to add consent preference to Profiles.
Segment requires every event from all of your sources to include the end user consent preferences, captured by your CMP or your application logic, in the form of theconsent object. The consent object is a JSON object nestled inside of thecontext objectwith the following format:
The JSON keys in the consent object should represent thecategoryIdfor each consent category.
Events without the consent object will continue to flow to destinations without consent enforcement.
Segment resolves conflicts between yourconsent object and your integration objectand between yourCMP and the consent categories you configured in the Segment app.
You can add both the integrations object and the consent object to your Segment payloads for greater control over how Segment routes data to your downstream destinations.
For more information about the Integrations object, please seeFiltering your Segment Data.
If an event includes both an integrations and consent object, Segment will look at the consent object first, and then take into account the integrations object according to the following table:
If you have a category configured in your consent management tool (for example,advertising) and there is no category with the same ID in Segment, the data will flow to unmapped destinations. If destinations are mapped to a different category in the Segment app, data flow will honor end user consent for that category.
If there is a category configured in Segment (functional) that is not mapped in your CMP, data will not flow to destinations mapped to thefunctionalcategory.
Events discarded due to consent preferences appear inDelivery Overviewat the “Filtered at destination” step with the discard reasonFiltered by end user consent.

Paragraphs:
Consent Management is available to customers on Business tier plans.See theavailable plans, orcontact Support.
On this page
After setting up your consent management platform (CMP), you can enforce the consent collected from your users by adding theconsent objectto your events.
Once you’ve configured consent in the Segment app and updated your sources to contain consent preference in every event, your events are routed only to the categories your end users consented to share data with. Events without the consent preference will continue to flow to destinations without consent enforcement.
Consent management edit and update capabilities limited to Workspace Owners
Only users with the Workspace Owner role are able to create, edit, and disable consent categories. All other users have read-only access to Consent Management features.
Before you can configure consent in Segment, take the following steps:
Limited availability of destinations
AWS S3 and Engage destinations do not enforce consent preferences.
Segment recommends mapping all destinations to a category
Segment assumes all destinations without a mapping do not require user consent and will receive all events containing a consent object. If a destination is mapped to multiple categories, a user must consent to all categories for data to flow to the destination.
Once you’ve created consent categories in the Segment app, you need to integrate your CMP with Segment.
Segment supports the following CMPs:
*If you send data to device-mode destinations connected to your Analytics.js source, you must navigate to your Analytics.js source in the Segment app, selectSettings > Analytics.js, and enable Destination Filters.
For more information about Segment’s Analytics.js OneTrust wrapper, see theAnalytics.js OneTrust Wrapperdocumentation.
If you’d like to integrate with any other CMP, Segment requires you to build your own wrapper or use any mechanism provided it meets the following requirements for data and event generation:
To get started building your own wrapper, follow the instructions in the@segment/analytics-consent-toolsrepository.
Consent Management is not backwards compatible with Segment's legacy iOS and Android libraries
If you are using one of Segment’s legacy mobile libraries (iOS or Android,) you will need to upgrade toSwiftorKotlinbefore using Consent Management.
Customers with Analytics.js 2.0 sources can use theSegment Inspectorto confirm that events from their source contain theconsent object. Unify and Engage users can also verify that theSegment Consent Preference Updated eventemits every time end users update their consent preferences.
All users can validate that events contain the consent object and that the Segment Consent Preference Updated event is present using Segment’sSource Debugger.
You can also confirm your events flow to destinations or are blocked from destinations according to the consent categories you created inStep 1: Create consent categories in the Segment App, if already connected to the destination.
If you need to make changes to your consent categories, you can edit them on the Consent Management page. You may experience some latency between making the changes and having the changes take effect.
TheAudit Trailsurfaces information about when a consent category is created, modified, or disabled, and when consent mappings are created or removed.
Disabling a consent category means that Segment no longer enforces end user consent preferences for the destinations in the disabled category. Other consent categories aren’t affected.

Consent in Unify and Twilio Engage is currently unavailable.
However, Segment’s OneTrust consent wrappers automatically generate the Segment Consent Preference Updated Track event, which will be required for future integrations with Unify and Twilio Engage.
Segment uses Profiles inUnifyas the source of truth of an end user’s consent preference when enforcing consent in Twilio Engage. To get consent preference on the Profile, Segment requires the use of theSegment Consent Preference Updated eventandIdentifyevents to route events to Unify. The Segment Consent Preference Updated and Identify events should include theconsent object.
Every time an end user provides or updates their consent preferences, Segment requires you to generate aSegment Consent Preference Updatedevent. If you are usingSegment’s OneTrust consent wrappers, Segment automatically generates a Segment Consent Preference Updated event. This event is required to add the end user’s consent preference on their Profile in Unify.
For example, if an end user agreed to share their information for functional and advertising purposes but not for analytics or data sharing, the Segment Consent Preference UpdatedTrack calldemonstrating their new consent preferences would have the following format:
If you use Protocols, the Segment app automatically adds the Segment Consent Preference Updated event to all your existing Tracking Plans and for every new Tracking Plan. Segment recommends you don’t edit or delete the default fields in the Segment Consent Preference Updated events, but you can add new fields as needed.
Segment Consent Preference Updated is a reserved event name
Segment has standardized a series of reserved event names that have special semantic meaning and maps these events to tools that support them.
See theSemantic Eventsdocs for more details.
In addition to enforcing consent in Connections, you may want these preferences to flow to each destination so your destinations can be aware when an end-user revokes their consent. You can use theDestination Actions frameworkto edit the destination’s mapping and copy the consent preferences from the Segment Consent Preference Updated event to a destination-specified consent field.
If you use Destination Actions to send consent information to your destinations, the Segment Consent Preference Updated event shouldonlyinclude information about a user’s consent preferences because this event is sent regardless of an end-user’s consent preferences.
Sharing consent with Classic Destinations is not available
Segment only supports sharing consent with Actions Destinations.

With Consent Management in Reverse ETL, you can enforce your end-users’ consent preferences that are captured by your consent management platform (CMP) and stored in your warehouse.
To enforce consent stored in your warehouse, build a Reverse ETL model that identifies consent categories. You can create a “consent to” column mapping in a new data model or update an existing data model to include a “consent to” mapping.
Consent in Reverse ETL supports Reverse ETL-supported Actions destinations and Segment Connections
At this time, Consent in Reverse ETL does not support adding consent to Segment Profiles using the Segment Profiles destination. To enforce consent data in your classic Segment destinations, use theSegment Connections destination.
Consent management edit and update capabilities limited to Workspace Owners
Only users with the Workspace Owner role are able to create, edit, and disable consent categories. All other users have read-only access to Consent Management features.
Before you can enforce consent stored in your warehouse, take the following steps:
Limited availability of destinations
Reverse ETL supports the Actions destinations in theReverse ETL catalogandSegment Connections.
Segment recommends mapping all Reverse ETL destinations to a category
Segment assumes all destinations without a mapping do not require user consent and will receive all events containing a consent object. If a destination is mapped to multiple categories, a user must consent to all categories for data to flow to the destination.
To edit or disable consent categories, view theConfigure Consent Managementdocumentation.
If you’ve already added aReverse ETL sourceto your workspace, you can proceed toStep 3: Identify consent columns.
If you haven’t already configured a Reverse ETL source in your workspace, follow the instructions in theReverse ETL: Add a sourcedocumentation to add your warehouse as a data source. When you’ve configured your Reverse ETL source, proceed toStep 3: Identify consent columns.
After you set up consent categories in the Segment app, you must identify the columns in your data warehouse that store end user consent by creating amodel, or SQL query that defines the set of data you want to synchronize to your Reverse ETL destinations. When building your data model, Segment recommends that you represent consent as a booleantrueorfalsevalue and map one consent category to one column.
Creating a data model that does not include information about consent preferences results in no consent enforcement
If you create consent categories in your workspace but fail to identify columns that contain consent preferences in your data model, events flow to all destinations in your workspace regardless of end user consent preferences.
To identify consent when building your model:
To update an existing Reverse ETL model to include consent enforcement:
You can select theSettingstab and clickConsent settingsto verify that the consent categories in your model match the consent categories you configured in your workspace.
You can store each consent category in its own column in your warehouse, or store your consent information in one single blob column. Segment requires your consent categories to be in their own column in your data model.
The following sample model maps consent categories from each column in your database:
The following sample model maps consent categories from one blob column in your database:
Failing to identify consent columns in your warehouse might lead to unintentional data loss
If you have destinations mapped to consent categories in the Segment app but fail to identify a column in your warehouse that stores consent for a category, then consent preference for that category will be considered to be false andno data will flow to destinations mapped to the category.
After you set up categories in the Segment app and create a SQL model that extracts consent information, connect your downstream destinations to complete the consent enforcement process.
Consent in Reverse ETL supports Reverse ETL-supported Actions destinations and Segment Connections
At this time, Consent in Reverse ETL does not support enforcing consent in the Segment Profiles destination. To enforce consent data in your classic Segment destinations, use theSegment Connections destination.
To add your first destination:
Segment does not count Reverse ETL records filtered by Consent Management toward your Reverse ETL limits
Records filtered out by Consent Management are not counted as part of your Reverse ETL limits. For more information about Reverse ETL limits, see theReverse ETL Limitsdocumentation.
You can validate that you successfully created your consent mapping in Segment Connections or supported Reverse ETL Actions destinations using the following methods.
Segment automatically adds theconsent objectto every event that’s routed downstream to your Segment Connections destination.Consent enforcement in Connectionsvalidates that only consenting data flows downstream to any classic Segment destinations connected to your Segment Connections instance.
Open the Source Debugger for your Reverse ETL source and confirm that theconsent objectappears on every event and that the consent object has the categories you mapped inStep 2: Identify consent columns.
Segment automatically filters out data from users who have not consented to the category mapped to your destination.
To verify that this behavior is working as intended, openDelivery Overviewfor a RETL-supported Actions destination and view the events that were successfully delivered to the destination. The events in your destination should only come from users that consented to send data to the category that your supported Actions destination belongs to.

No. Segment’s deprecatedopen-source Consent Manager, whichcapturesend user cookie consent, is not part of Segment’s Consent Management product, which focuses only onenforcingend user consent. Enforcing end user consent means sharing your end users’ data with only the destinations they consented to share data with and blocking the flow of their data to all other destinations.
Segment recommends moving from the deprecated, open-source Consent Manager to one that meets your legal compliance requirements.
All event streams destinations, with the exception of AWS S3 and Engage destinations, support consent enforcement.
You can use theDestination Actions frameworkto share the current status of your end-users’ consent with your Actions destinations.

Paragraphs:
On this page
Segment allows you to delete specific data relating to an individual end user, all data from associated with a source, all data related to a Unify space, or all data in your entire workspace.
To delete the data for an individual user from you workspace, follow the instructions on theUser Deletion and Suppressionpage.
To delete the data for an entire source, email the Customer Success team(friends@segment.com)to create a support ticket. In your email to Customer Success, include the following information:
*Due to the way Segment stores data internally, source-level deletions can only be scoped to one day in granularity. Deletion requests for smaller time frames are not supported.
Deleting source data
When Segment deletes your data for a particular source, the deletion is not forwarded to sources or data storage providers associated with your account: your data is only removed from Segment’s S3 archive buckets. To remove your data from external sources, reach out to the individual source about their deletion practices.
Workspace Owners can delete a Unify space and all of its associated data by sending an email to the Customer Success team(friends@segment.com)to create a support ticket. In your email to Customer Success, include the following information:
Segment waits for 5 calendar days after your request before starting a space deletion. If you want to cancel your Unify space deletion request, email the Customer Success team(friends@segment.com)during the first 5 calendar days after your initial request.
Data removed during a Unify space deletion
When you delete a Unify space, Segment removes all profiles, computed traits, audiences, journeys, and other settings related to the Unify space from internal Segment servers. Unify space deletion doesn’t delete data from connected Twilio Engage destinations. To remove your data from external destinations, reach out to the individual destination about their deletion practices.
Workspace admins can delete all of the data associated with a workspace, including customer data.
To delete all data from one workspace:
To delete data from all workspaces in which you have workspace admin permissions:
After you delete your workspace or account, Segment removes all data associated with each workspace within 30 days in a process called acomplete data purge. For a data purge status update, email the Customer Success team(friends@segment.com).
If you don’t delete your workspace after you stop using Segment,your data remains in Segment’s internal servers until you submit a written deletion request.
Purging data from workspaces deleted prior to March 31, 2022
If you deleted your workspace prior to March 31, 2022, and would like to have data associated with your workspace purged from Segment’s S3 archive buckets, email the Customer Success team(friends@segment.com)to create a support ticket. In your email to Customer Success, include either the slug or the ID of the workspace you’d like to have purged from internal Segment servers.
A complete data purge is the way Segment removes all workspace and customer data from internal servers across all product areas. To trigger a complete data purge, eitherdelete your workspaceor raise a support ticket with the Customer Success team by emailing(friends@segment.com). In your email to Customer Success, include either the slug or the ID of the workspace that you’d like to delete. Deletions related to data purges willnotbe forwarded to your connected third-party destinations or raw data destinations.
Segment waits for five calendar days before beginning a complete data purge to safeguard against malicious deletion requests. If you notice your workspace or account has been maliciously deleted, reach out tofriends@segment.comto cancel the data purge. After the five-day grace period, the deletion will be irreversible.

Segment is a HIPAA eligible platform, and meets the data privacy and security requirements of healthcare customers and their stakeholders. For more information about Segment becoming HIPAA eligible, see theannouncement blog post.
Twilio BAA are available to customers on a Business Tier plan.
Before you begin, check that the Segment products and services you’ll use for your HIPAA workflows are on the list of Twilio’sHIPAA Eligible Products and Services. After you’ve verified availability, contact your Account Expert torequest a demo.
Ensure your Workspace is eligible for HIPAA before you configure and send any personal health information (PHI).
With the BAA signed and Workspace confirmed as eligible, you can start building. For more information about starting a HIPAA compliant implementation, see Twilio’sArchitecting for HIPAA on Twilio, which outlines the shared responsibilities and requirements for building and maintaining HIPAA-compliant workflows in Segment.
Segment maintains audit logs of every read and update action a user performs in the Segment app that may involve PHI/PII.
Data captured in the HIPAA audit logs includes:
These logs can be provided upon request. For specific requests, please reach out tofriends@segment.com.
Segment encrypts the data in select fieldsmarked as yellow in the Privacy Portalbefore sending them to event stream, cloud mode destinations, further supporting HIPAA compliance in your destinations. Segment encrypts data using a RSAES OAEP SHA 256 algorithm.
Data encryption does not support “fuzzy matching”. You can encryptDefault PII matchers,Custom PII matchers, and anySynonymsyou’ve created for keys.
Data encryption only supports event-stream, cloud-mode destinations
Only data fields incontext,traits, andpropertyobjects can be encrypted.
After Segment encrypts the data, the encrypted data value is always astring. Any downstream validation that looks forintegerorbooleandata types will fail for encrypted values.
To configure data encryption while setting up a new destination:
Private Key is not recoverable
Segment does not save the private key created during the data encryption setup flow, and cannot retrieve the key after you finish setting up your destination. You can generate a new key using the instructions in theConfigure new key pairssection. Any data encrypted prior to generating a new key pair cannot be decrypted with the new key.
To configure data encryption for an existing destination:
Private Key is not recoverable
Segment does not save the private key created during the data encryption setup flow, and cannot retrieve the key after you finish setting up your destination. You can generate a new key using the instructions in theConfigure new key pairssection. Any data encrypted prior to generating a new key pair cannot be decrypted with the new key.
If you lose access to your private key, you can generate a new key pair in your destination’s Data Encryption tab. Any data previously encrypted using the previous key pair is unaffected, but cannot be decrypted using the new key.
To generate a new key pair:
After enabling encryption for a destination, you can add or remove encrypted data fields in your destination’sData Encryptiontab. All changes made to fields are forward-looking. You may experience some latency between making the changes and having the changes take effect.
To make changes to your selected fields:
Disabling the data encryption setting removes encryption on all previously configured data.
To remove encryption from incoming data:
Disabling the data encryption setting does not decrypt existing data, but does prevent any future data from being encrypted.
Segment automatically logs out all users with access to HIPAA eligible workspaces after 15 minutes of inactivity.

Paragraphs:
On this page
The Privacy Portal doesn’t doesn’t support fields from Cloud Object Sources like Salesforce or Zendesk.
Segment provides suggested classifications based ondefault PII matchers. These suggestions include exact and fuzzy matches for potential PII. You can update these classifications by following the instructions tochange a recommended classification.
Only Workspace Owners can access the portal.
All Segment plans include access to the Privacy Portal. Data privacy is a fundamental Segment feature, not an add-on.
When you block data at the source level using Privacy Controls, the data never enters Segment. As a result, Segment can’t replay the data. Segment recommends exercising caution when blocking data at the source level.
Segment classifications are recommendations. If a destination requires a field classified as Yellow, you can override the recommended classification to ensure the field gets sent downstream.
To locate a specificuserId, query your Segmentdata warehousefor theuserstable. Use other known details about the user, like their email address, to identify the correct row and retrieve theuserId.
You can send batches of up to 5,000userIds, or 4 MB, per payload. Segment processes these batches asynchronously.Contact Segmentif you need to process more than 110,000 users within a 30-day period.
In addition to your Raw Data destinations (Amazon S3 and data warehouses), Segment can forward requests to the following streaming destinations:
Segment forwards deletion requests but cannot guarantee that data is deleted from downstream destinations. You must contact these destinations to confirm that they executed the request.
To process deletion requests in Amplitude, add your Amplitude secret key to the destination settings under “Secret Key.” You can find this key in your Amplitude project’sGeneral Settings.
To send deletion requests to Google Analytics, authenticate your account with Segment using OAuth. Go to theUser Deletionsettings in your Segment Google Analytics destination and use your email and password to complete authentication.
Segment supports the following regulation types:
UsingSUPPRESS_WITH_DELETEorDELETE_ONLYregulation types might lead to additional charges levied by your destination providers.

Protocols was built to automate and scale thedata quality best practicesdeveloped over years of helping customers implement Segment. Investing in data quality will improve trust in your data, reduce time spent by your engineering and business teams navigating and validating data, and ultimately allow your business to grow faster.
Protocols is a premium add-on feature available to Business Tier customers. If your plan includes Protocols, you can access itfrom theprotocolspath in your workspace. If your plan doesn’t include Protocols, contact your Segment account executive.
Good data quality starts with a well thought out Tracking Plan. With Protocols, you can define your events and corresponding properties in a Tracking Plan. This tracking plan becomes a central source of truth for product, engineering, analytics, and business teams.
With your tracking plan living in Segment, you can apply it to 1 or more data sources. Any event or property that does not match the tracking plan will generate a violation. Violations are displayed in aggregated form to spot trends, and detailed form to help you quickly find and resolve discrepancies.
To maintain a high degree of quality over time, we offer strict controls to block non-conforming events. Blocked events can be forwarded to a separate quarantined Segment source for analysis and review.
Even the most exacting data collection processes are subject to human error and organizational complexity. Transformations can be applied from within Protocols to change event and property names without touching code.

Figuring out what events to track in Segment can feel overwhelming. Fortunately, Segment has helped thousands of customers through this process and has amassed a ton of resources to help you get started. Whether you’re a small team just getting your app off the ground or a highly complex enterprise with hundreds of stakeholders, these resources can help.
That being said, be prepared to invest time defining how you want to track data. Any investment in improving data quality will reap massive rewards, and compound over time by allowing your analytics teams to produce better insights, your marketing teams to run better campaigns and so much more.
Tracking is about learning and taking action. Think about what you want to know about your product or customers. Think about what assumptions need to be tested or invalidated. Think about the unknowns. Here are some helpful questions to get started:
Segment recommends documenting your high-level business objectives. What measurable business outcomes do you want to achieve? Do you want to acquire new customers, activate new signups, drive incremental revenues among your current customer base? You can best answer this question by interviewing stakeholders who would consume the data in your organization.
With your business goals documented, you now need to map user actions to those business goals. For example, if one of your goals is to activate new signups, you want to think about which activities are related to a signup. Ask yourself what actions people take before signing up. Do specific actions predict user signups?
As an example, you may end up with a list like the following:
While these may only represent a portion of the total user actions you will track, focusing on business objectives helps make data collection more manageable.
With your business objectives documented, it’s time to build a set of standards that you and your team will use when determining what to track. Segment’s most successful customers limit their tracking plan to a minimal number of core events with rich properties that provide context. While some customers find success with the “less is more” philosophy of tracking data, others take a more liberal “track more and analyze later” approach. Both options have pros and cons you should take into account when you consider your company’s needs.
Regardless of your approach, keep the following tips in mind:
Pick a casing convention.Segment recommendsTitle Casefor event names andsnake_casefor property names. Make sure you pick a casing standard and enforce it across your events and properties.
Pick an event name structure.As you may have noticed from theSegment specs, Segment uses the Object (Blog Post) + Action (Read) framework for event names. Pick a convention and stick to it.
Don’t create event names dynamically.Avoid creating events that pull a dynamic value into the event name (likeUser Signed Up (11-01-2019)).
Don’t create events to track properties.Avoid adding values to event names that could be a property. Instead, add values a property (like"blog_post_title":"Best Tracking Plans Ever").
Don’t create property keys dynamically.Avoid creating property names like"feature_1":"true","feature_2":"false", as these are ambiguous and difficult to analyze.

Atracking planclarifies what events to track, where those events live in the code base, and why those events are necessary from a business perspective. Prior to Protocols, tracking plans typically lived in a spreadsheet. The tracking plan served as a project management tool to align an entire organization around data as the basis on which to make decisions. The tracking plan helps marketers, product managers, engineers, and analysts get on the same page.
The tracking plan has been so instrumental in helping organizations reclaim their own data efforts that Segment invested years of product development to createProtocols. Whatever tool you choose to build your tracking plan, make sure that it represents a single source of truth for your data collection efforts.
The Identify call is important because it updates all records of the user with a set of traits. But how do you choose which traits to include?
Here is a sample Identify call (withanalytics.js) for Segment:
The traits represent dimensions in your data that you can group or pivot on. For example, in the previous sample call, you can easily create cohorts of all types that areusersor accounts created within a time window of your choosing.
After you’ve documented yourevent naming and collection standards, it’s time to add events to your tracking plan. Segment recommends starting with fewer events that are directly tied to one of yourbusiness objectives. This focused effort helps avoid a situation where you become overwhelmed by endless possible actions to track. As you get more comfortable, you can add more events to your tracking plan that can answer peripheral questions.
Segment began by tracking these events:
Next, Segment added some of the following peripheral events that helped monitor performance:
For an ecommerce company, however, the main events might be something like:
Note that Segment has a set of “reserved” event names specifically for ecommerce, called the Segmentecommerce spec. Check it out to see which events Segments covers and how they are used in our downstream destinations.
For a community, on the other hand, an entirely different set of actions indicate engagement, listed in the following pyramid. For example, a community likeGrowthHackersmay want to track actions like:
With this, they’re able to measure key metrics around engagement and understand how users are moving towards their ultimate conversion event: curation content for others. For more information, check outthis articlefrom GrowthHackers about the events they track and why.
Each Track call can accept an optional dictionary ofproperties, which can contain any key-value pair you want. Thesepropertiesact as dimensions that allow your end tool to group, filter, and analyze the events. They give you additional detail on broader events.
As mentioned earlier, events should be generic and high level, whereas properties are specific and detailed. For example, at Segment,Business Tier Workspace Createdworks poorly as an event name. Instead, Segment usedWorkspace Createdwith apropertyofaccount_tierand value ofbusiness:
Similar to the traits in the Identify call, the properties provide you a column that you can pivot against or filter on in your analytics tools or allow you to create a cohort of users in email tools.
Avoid dynamically generatedkey’s in thepropertiesdictionary, as eachkeywill create a new column in your downstream tools. Dynamically generatedkey’s will clutter your tools with data that will make it difficult and confusing to use later.
Here is Segment’sLead CapturedTrack call:
The high level event isLead Capturedand all of the details are tucked into thepropertiesdictionary. In its downstream tools, Segment can easily look at how many leads were captured in different locations on the Segment website.
If you want to learn more about how properties are used by downstream tools, check outThe Anatomy of a Track Call.

Paragraphs:
On this page
A Tracking Plan is a data spec outlining the events and properties you intend to collect across your Segment Sources. Crafting a comprehensive Tracking Plan takes time and effort across a range of teams within your organization, and a deep understanding of your business objectives. Once created, the Tracking Plan becomes a highly valuable resource for both the engineers instrumenting Segment and all consumers of the data flowing through Segment. You canlearn more about data quality best practicesin the Protocols docs.
When building a Tracking Plan, it’s best to start with the key metrics that drive value for your business. Key metrics may include new user signups, top line revenue, product use and more. With key metrics defined, it becomes much easier to define which user actions help track or improve those key metrics. Each user action maps to a distinct event, or Track call, that you will track in Segment. The Tracking Plan can also validate Identify, Page and Group calls.
The Segment Tracking Plan feature allows you to validate your expected events against the live events that are delivered to Segment. Violations generate when an event doesn’t match the spec’d event in the Tracking Plan.
Segment can infer event data types, but is unable to do so if several data types are sent for a specific category.
Tracking Plans are stored in workspaces and can be connected to one or more Sources.
Segment Consent Preference Updated Event
After setting up a consent category, users of Consent Management see a Segment Consent Preference Updated Event added to all existing Tracking Plans.
To create a new Tracking Plan:
Consent Management users see the Segment Consent Preference Updated event on new Tracking Plans
If you are a Consent Management user and have created at least one consent category, Segment automatically adds theSegment Consent Preference Updated eventto all new Tracking Plans.
To create a copy of an existing Tracking Plan:
To download a Tracking Plan:
The columns in the Tracking Plan CSV file corresponds to the Tracking Plan UI options. For example:
Once you’ve downloaded a Tracking Plan, you canupload itas a template for a new Tracking Plan or use it to make changes to an existing Tracking Plan.
You can create a Tracking Plan or make changes to an existing Tracking Plan by uploading a CSV that contains the rules and events you’d like to track. Segment provides a Tracking Plan template file that you can download during the import process, or you candownload an existing Tracking Planto use as your template.
Tracking Plan CSV requirements
Tracking Plan CSV files uploaded to Segment must be smaller than 15 mb and contain one header row and one or more rows of data. Tracking Plans CSVs must also have fewer than 100,000 rows and 2,000 rules.
To create a new Tracking Plan by uploading a CSV file:
After uploading your CSV file, you are redirected to the Upload & Download History page while the upload is in progress. If the CSV upload fails, you’ll be able to either view the error directly in the Reports column on the Upload & Download History page or download theerror_report.csvfile that corresponds to the Tracking Plan you uploaded.
Tracking Plans created by an uploaded file are reflected in theAudit TrailandTracking Plan changelog. If you are a Consent Management user and have created at least one consent category, Segment automatically adds theSegment Consent Preference Updated eventto all new Tracking Plans.
Tracking Plans with imported libraries cannot be changed using the Upload a Tracking Plan method
If you have a Tracking Plan with imported libraries, you must make changes to your Tracking Plan in the Segment app.
To update a Tracking Plan by uploading a CSV file:
After uploading your CSV file, you are redirected to the Upload & Download History page while the upload is in progress. If the CSV upload fails, you’ll be able to either view the error directly in the Reports column on the Upload & Download History page or download theerror_report.csvfile that corresponds to the Tracking Plan you uploaded.
Any changes made to a Tracking Plan using an uploaded file are reflected in theAudit TrailandTracking Plan changelog.
Deleting a Tracking Plan requires Workspace Owner or Tracking Plan Admin permissions
You must have Workspace Owner or Tracking Plan Admin roles to delete a Tracking Plan. For more information about roles in Segment, see theRoles documentation.
To delete a Tracking Plan:
The Tracking Plan editor is organized as a spreadsheet to help you  add new events and properties, and edit the relevant fields for each. Like a spreadsheet, you can navigate across cells in a single event with your arrow keys and press enter to edit a cell.
The Status, Data Type, and Permitted Values columns appear as you add a Track call property.
To add a new Track call:
To add a Track call property:
Segment supports object and array data types in the Tracking Plan editor. These complex data structures have limited use cases and should be used sparingly as some destinations aren’t able to ingest the data structures. To add an object or array:
When creating array properties in your Tracking Plan, add theitemsnested property, denoted by the name of the array property with a.$suffix, to ensure that the nested property is marked as planned in the Source Schema.
You can define which traits you expect to see passed in Identify or Group calls like how you would add Track calls to the Tracking Plan. Navigate to theIdentifyorGrouptab in your Tracking Plan and click the(+)button to add a new trait.
It’s best to keep traits optional because Identify and Group are often called and pass onlynew or changedtraits, because Segment’s client-side libraries (analytics.js, Swift, Kotlin) cache traits in local storage. See theIdentify Best Practicesto learn more.
Removing a source from a Tracking Plan requires Workspace Owner or Tracking Plan Admin permissions
You must have Workspace Owner or Tracking Plan Admin roles to remove a source from a Tracking Plan. For more information about roles in Segment, see theRoles documentation.
To remove a source from your Tracking Plan:
You can applykey:valuelabels to each event to help organize your Tracking Plan. These labels are helpful when multiple teams are managing a single Tracking Plan, or if you want to specify a priority, platform, product, or similar meta-data for each event. You can filter by label from the Tracking Plan, Schema, Data Validation and Violations Summary views.
For consistency purposes, it’s best that you create a standard way of labeling events and share it with all parts of your organization that will use Segment.

Note:Tracking Plan Labels are only available for Track and Page events.
You can filter the Tracking Plan events by keyword or by label. The applied filter generates a permanent link so you can share specific events with teammates. Label filters also persist after you leave the Tracking Plan.
Protocols Tracking Plans useJSON Schemasto validate Segment event payloads. To support a broader range of validation use-cases, Segment lets you to edit your underlying JSON schema.
Editing a JSON schema requires technical expertise. TheJSON schema documentationandJSON schema validatorare helpful resources you can use.
You can edit the JSON schema for each Track event listed in the Tracking Plan, and a common JSON schema definition that applies across all events.
Each Track event in the Tracking Plan has a separate JSON schema definition to validate the properties in that event. To edit, click on the overflow menu next to each event row in the Tracking Plan.
Advanced edits to the JSON schema are not visible in the Tracking Plan and make it harder for other users to understand the validation logic. Be sure to communicate to any other Protocols users that you are making changes in the validation logic.
The Tracking Plan also uses a common JSON schema definition that applies to the entire payload of every event sent from sources connected to the Tracking Plan.
The common JSON schema definition is unique for each Tracking Plan. An example use of this feature is to validate that all Track, Identify and Page events sent to Segment include acontext.device.advertisingIdproperty. This validation ensures that every Segment call has a userId, anonymousId, and context object with a nested"device": { "advertisingId": "e23sfsdf"}object.
To edit the common JSON schema:
To edit the common JSON schema using the Public API, you’ll need to add your new JSON schema under the"global": object.
Negative lookahead regexes (?!)aren’t supported. This means you can’t use regex to prevent matches with a specific following character or expression. But, you can usenotin the regex of your JSON schema to generate violations when a property key or value doesn’t match the provided regex pattern.
Specifying data type
Property or trait data type should adhere to thedata types defined by JSON schema. Data type names must be lower-cased as specified in JSON schema. Date/time properties should be represented as astringtype withformatkeyword(for example: “format”: “date-time”).
Blocking data
JSON schema violation event blocking isonlysupported in cloud-mode Destinations. Seethe Customize your schema controls docsfor more information on blocking data.
Some customers prefer to manage the Tracking Plan with outside tools and resources. See theAPIs and extensionssection to learn more.
Segment offers Tracking Plan Event Versioning if you use Protocols to manage mobile sources, or to help you centrally manage a Tracking Plan for multiple teams. With Event Versioning, you can create multiple versions of an event definition, and validate events using a version key included in the Track event payload.
This can be helpful for mobile developers who might have several released versions of their app sending data at the same time. For example, a new mobile app release might add a new required property to an event likeOrder Completed. In this scenario, if you updated the Tracking Plan, allOrder Completedevents from your old mobile app versions would be invalid, because some customers won’t have updated to the latest version yet. Instead, with event versioning, you can allow validation of both the old and new versions of an event at the same time. When you’re ready to deprecate those old event versions, you can delete the version in your Tracking Plan.
For example, say you want to addsubtotalas a required property to yourOrder Completedevent. You would start by adding the required property to the event in the Tracking Plan as shown in the example below.

With event versioning, you can now create multiple versions of the event definition as shown in the example below. To create a new event version, click into the overflow menu for an event and selectAdd Event Version.

To ensure the Track events you send to a Segment source validate against the correct event version, you need to instrument your events to include acontext.protocols.event_versionkey and version value. The version value must pass as an integer, and should match the number shown in the Tracking Plan version tab. In the example below, the version number would be2.

Next, add the event version number to the context object. Foranalytics.jsTrack calls, you would instrument the event as in the example below. Note how the JSON objects forcontext,protocols, andevent_versionare nested.
Note:Protocols validate events against the oldest event version in the Tracking Plan for event payloads that are 1) missing the context.protocols.event_version key, or 2) contain an invalid/undefined event version (ex: event_version:3.2).

Tracking Plan Libraries make it easy to scale Tracking Plan creation within your workspace. You can create libraries for track events or track event properties. Editing Tracking Plan Libraries is identical toediting Tracking Plans.
Note: Segment does support advanced JSON schema implementations and identify/group trait libraries.
Once created, you can import event or property Libraries into a Tracking Plan using a simple wizard flow.
To create a new Library:

Tracking Plan Event Libraries support Track events and associated properties. Event Libraries are helpful when you want to track a group of events consistently across tracking plans. For example, if you are an eCommerce company with more than one application, you may need to trackeCommerce Specevents consistently across those sources. Instead of needing to re-create the eCommerce spec across all tracking plans, create a library and import the events to each Tracking Plan.
Tracking Plan property Libraries support Track event property groups. Property Libraries are helpful when you have more than one event in a Tracking Plan that share a common set of properties. For example, if you want to consistently includeorder_id,currency,cart_idand aproductsarray of objects in your checkout flow events, you can create a Library with these properties including descriptions, data types and conditional filters.
You can import event and property libraries into a Tracking Plan. Enter the Draft mode for a Tracking Plan and click theImport from Event or Property Librarydropdown. A wizard will appear allowing you to either add the events to a tracking plan, or add properties to selected events already in the tracking plan. After adding your events or properties, remember to merge your changes!

When you import events or properties from a Library, you can enable syncing to ensure that changes made to the Library pass down to all synced Tracking plans. Syncing is important when you want to make sure all Tracking Plans define events and properties consistently. For example, it’s best practice to create separate tracking plans for mobile and web sources as these two sources share some but not all events or properties. Library syncing is the best way to ensure that the shared events are consistently tracked across Tracking Plans, even as you make changes to the Library.
To enable syncing, select the desired Library from the Tracking Plan import flow, and toggle the syncing option. This selects all events or properties in the Library for import. Partial syncs are not supported.
Syncing a Library makes events and properties un-editable, and bypasses the Tracking Plan merge step. You can add properties to synced events, but cannot remove those synced events unless you also remove the Library sync. To unsync a library, clickView Synced Librariesfrom the Tracking Plan and click the overflow menu to unsync the Library.
All changes made to a synced library pass through to the Tracking Plans and may impact data deliverability

Crawling: https://segment.com/docs/protocols/enforce/schema-configuration/
Paragraphs:
Protocols is available as an add-on for Business plans only.See theavailable plans, orcontact Support.
On this page
The Schema Configuration settings for each source can be used to selectively block events, or omit properties and traits from.track(),.identify()and.group()calls. Segment can permanently drop events that are not included in your Tracking Plan, depending on the settings you select. Segment can also block events with invalid properties or invalid property values.
Blocked events not forwarded to a Source are discarded
Blocking is a serious step that you should only do after you have resolved any violations that appear when you first connect a Tracking Plan to a Source. Any blocked events that are notforwarded to a separate Sourceare permanently discarded and cannot be recovered.
To enable blocking, go to theSettingstab for your source and click onSchema Configuration. See below for detailed descriptions for each of the configuration settings.

You canexport your Source Schemaas a CSV file to quickly audit events from your Tracking Plan.
Archived events
If you archive events while your source is connected to a Tracking Plan, and then later disconnect your Tracking Plan from that source, any archived events will remain archived, but will be allowed if the Schema Configuration was previously set to block unplanned events when your Tracking Plan was connected to the source.
To view all archived events, go to yourSource Schemapage, clickFilternext to the search bar, and selectArchived. To unarchive events that have been archived, clickUnarchivein the event column.
When setting up Schema Configuration, note that Segment prioritizes blocking controls in the following order:
Standard Schema Controls: Segment first evaluates incoming events against these controls and your Tracking Plan. Events, properties, or traits not blocked or omitted in this phase then flow to the next level of controls: the Advanced Blocking Controls/Common JSON Schema.
Advanced Blocking Controls/Common JSON Schema:These controls act as a secondary layer, evaluating incoming events against the Common JSON schema included in your Tracking Plan.
Using only the Common JSON Schema to block events
If your Tracking Plan only has Common JSON Schema rules, you only need to use the Advanced Blocking Controls for your source.
If you use the Standard Schema Controls and omit properties or traits that do not exist, the Tracking Plan might not generate violations for the Common JSON Schema, as the entire Tracking Plan has nothing and everything is considered to be “unplanned”.
When you set this dropdown to Block Event, Segment drops any events that are not defined in your Tracking Plan. Only allowlistedtrackcalls in your Tracking Plan flow through Segment to your Destinations.
For example, if you include aSubscription Cancelledevent in your Tracking Plan, the example track call below would be blocked by Protocols because the event name does not match the event name casing in your Tracking Plan.
IMPORTANT: Unplanned event blocking is supported across all device-mode and cloud-mode Destinations.
Setting this dropdown to Omit Properties will ensure that properties not defined in your Tracking Plan are removed from the relevant event.
For example, if you include a singlesubscription_idproperty in theSubscription Cancelledevent in your tracking plan, the example track call below would have thesubscription_nameproperty omitted by Protocols.
IMPORTANT: Unplanned property omission is ONLY supported in cloud-mode Destinations. Unplanned properties will not be omitted when sending to device-mode Destinations.
JSON schema violation event blocking only supports cloud-mode destinations
Events with invalid properties are not blocked from device-mode destinations.
To block all Track calls that generate a common JSON schema violation:
Setting the dropdown toBlock Eventensures that all Track events with JSON schema violations (for example, missing required properties, incorrect property value data types, or invalid regex patterns) are blocked. A less aggressive option is to selectOmitfrom the dropdown which removes the offending property from the events.
This is an advanced feature that requires extensive testing and a squeaky clean data set/Tracking Plan to enable. To get a sense of which events will be blocked, or properties omitted, go to the Violations view for a source and note all events with a violation. For example, if you added asubscription_idrequired property to yourSubscription Cancelledevent in your Tracking Plan, the below track call would be either blocked by Protocols, or the property would be omitted, depending on your settings.
IMPORTANT: JSON schema violation event blocking is ONLY supported in cloud-mode Destinations. Events with invalid properties will not be blocked from sending to device-mode Destinations.
Setting this dropdown to Omit Traits will ensure that traits not defined in your Tracking Plan are removed from the identify call. For example, if you specify three traits in your Tracking Plan (name,email,join_date), the below identify call would have thefirst_nameproperty omitted by Protocols.
IMPORTANT: Unplanned identify trait blocking is ONLY supported in cloud-mode Destinations. Events with invalid traits will not be blocked from sending to device-mode Destinations.
JSON schema violation event blocking only supports cloud-mode destinations
Events with invalid properties are not blocked from device-mode destinations.
To block all Identify calls that generate a common JSON schema violation:

If you’re concerned about permanently discarding blocked events, you can enable blocked event forwarding on a Segment Source. To set up forwarding, navigate to the settings tab of the Source, then Schema Configuration.
Select the source you’ll forward events to from the Blocked Events and Traits dropdown. Segment recommends that you create a new Source for forwarded events to avoid contaminating production data and enable blocking only when you are confident about the quality of your data.
Since forwarding happens server to server, Segment recommends creating aHTTP Tracking API source, though any server-side source will work.

Only blocked events are forwarded to the source. Events with omitted traits are not forwarded. Instead, Segment inserts acontext.protocolsobject into the event payload which contains the omitted properties or traits.
Billing Note: Events forwarded to another Source count towards to your MTU counts. Blocking and discarding events does not contribute to your MTU counts.

With Transformations, you can change data as it flows through Segment to either correct bad data or customize data for a specific destination. Change event and property names to align events with your Tracking Plan, or to conform to a destination-specific requirement. For example, you can create a Transformation to change an event name fromcompleted_ordertoOrder Completedto conform toSegment’s ecommerce spec.
You can also useSegment’s Public APIto transform events, properties, and property values for manyuse cases.
Transformations are very powerful and should be applied with care.
Transformationsirrevocablychange the event payloads flowing through Segment and immediately affect either all destinations, or a single downstream destination, depending on your settings.
As soon as you apply a Transformation, the original tracking payloads are not easily recoverable.
Segment’s goal is to make Transformations a powerful tool that complements a well structured Tracking Plan. Together, these features help your organization scale and achieve high data quality. For that reason Segment recommends that you start your data quality strategy with a clearly defined Tracking Plan. Without this critical component, the risk of creating conflicting or detrimental transformations increases.
All Protocols Transformations are listed in the Transformations tab in the Protocols section. The list view supports filtering and sorting to organize transformations by transformation type, source, and destination.

Transformations can be enabled and disabled directly from the list view using the toggle.
Transformations can be deleted and edited by clicking on the overflow menu. When editing a Transformation, only the resulting event or property names, and Transformation name can be edited. If you want to select a different event or source, create a separate Transformation rule.
Transformations created using the Public API
On the Transformations page in the Segment app, you can view and rename transformations that you created with the Public API. In some cases, you can edit these transformations in the UI.
To create a Transformation, navigate to the Transformations tab in Protocols and clickNew Transformationin the top right. A three-step wizard guides you through creating a transformation.
Workspace Owner or Source Admin permissions are required to create and edit transformations.
Source Read-only permissions are required to view transformations.

To create a Transformation, you first need to select which type of transformation you want to create. For each transformation type, Segment displays a description, use cases, and example payload. Current transformation types available in your Segment workspace include:
Rename track event:Rename track event name at the source or per destination. The events listed in the event names dropdown menu correspond to the events listed on thesource schema view.
Edit track event properties:Rename multiple properties and/or change property data structure at the source or per destination
Edit identify or group event traits:Rename multiple traits and/or change trait data structure at the source or per destination
View moreuse casesof Transformations available in both your workspace andSegment’s Public API.
Depending on the transformation type you selected, relevant drop-down selectors and fields are presented to define how you want to transform the data.
Multiple transformations cannot be created for the same source + type + event + destination combo. This restriction blocks circular transformations (for example,order_updatedtoorderUpdatedtoorder_updated), minimizes unexpected transformations, and enables easy filtering across each dimension.
Regardless of the type of transformation selected, first select a source. Each Transformation can only apply to a single source. While this makes it more difficult to apply transformations broadly, it ensures you are only transforming data relevant to the selected source.
After selecting the source, you will need to select a scope. Scope determines where Segment applies the transformation.
Source-scoped Transformations only apply to cloud-mode, S3, and data warehouse destinations.

Source scope:Events are transformed in allactive Segment cloud-mode destinations, warehouses, and S3 destinations.This scope is best when you want to fix malformed events before sending them to all destinations. These transformations should be treated as a temporary solution to hold you over while your engineering team fixes the root event.
Destination scope:Events are transformed in ONLY the selected cloud-mode destination.Device-mode destinations, S3, and data warehouses are not currently supported.Use the Destination scope when you want to customize an event to the unique requirements of a destination. These transformations can exist permanently.
Depending on the type of transformation you selected, you will need to enter the relevant event, property, or trait mappings to create the transformation.
Select an Event:After you select the scope, use the search box to choose the event to transform. You canonlyselect a single track event, identify or group call. If you are renaming the event, simply enter the new name in the provided text field.
Rename properties or traits:To rename properties or traits within a selected event, click+ Add Property. The dropdown that appears contains the properties or traits sent with the selected event. Segment supports JSON Path notation to select nested objects up to four levels deep. For example,order.idselects theidproperty in theorderobject. Segment does not support.$.notation to select a property from an array of objects. For example, the following event, which generatesproducts.$.product_id, is unsupported.
In this scenario, we do not support the transformation of product_id.
After selecting a property/trait, select JSON Path or Simple String to change the property/trait. Simple string will change the name in-line, while JSON path allows you to move the property/trait in or out of an object.
When you see properties that have the escape character\in them - this escape character\is added to differentiate between a property name that has a . in it, and a nested field, like so:
Enter a descriptive name to act as a label for the transformation. This label helps you organize your Transformations, and Segment recommends that you make this descriptive and focused on the problem you’re solving. For exampleFix misnamed order_completed event for ecommerce specis much better thanMap order_completed.
In this step, you can also choose to keep the Transformation disabled, so you can come back and edit it later. To update, enable, or disable a Transformation, click on the overflow menu and selectEdit Transformation.
Here’s a list of Segment Transformations with some use case examples.
Rename an event:Change an event name fromviewed_producttoProduct Viewed.
Rename a property or trait:Change the property namerevenuetototalfor a specific destination.
Update a property value:UseSegment’s Public APIto transform the propertycurrencyto have the valueUSD.

Typewriter for analytics.js and analytics-node will receive no new features and only critical maintenance updates from Segment. Typewriter for other libraries and SDKs are not actively maintained by Segment. Typewriter is available onGitHubunder the MIT license for the open-source community to fork and contribute.
Typewriteris a tool for generating strongly-typed Segment analytics libraries based on your pre-definedTracking Planspec.
At a high-level, Typewriter can take an event from your Tracking Plan like this"Order Completed"event:

Typewriter uses the event to generate a typed analytics call in different languages:
Typewriter can generate clients foranalytics.js,analytics-node,analytics-swiftandanalytics-kotlin.
These generated clients are embedded with metadata from your Tracking Plan, which contextualizes your analytics instrumentation, and reduces (or entirely eliminates!) incorrect instrumentations in your production environments. In your editor, you can access event names, descriptions, property names, types and more:

You can also configure Typewriter to validate analytic events at runtime, which can alert you to instrumentation errors during development and testing. Typewriter can warn you about missing required properties, invalid enum values, regex mismatches, and any other advancedJSON Schemayou configure in your Tracking Plan.

You can use this with a test suite to automatically fail your unit tests if the instrumentation generates any violations:

If you use a statically typed language (such as TypeScript, Java, Objective-C, or Swift), you get access to compile-time warnings about your instrumentation:

Typewriter also helps teams adoptanalytics best practices, such as avoiding autogenerated event names, and carefully considering what properties are tracked.
To get started, check out one of the quickstart guides below:
For use with the Analytics-iOS and Analytics-Android SDK, useTypewriter v7.

Typewriter is built usingNode.js, and requires node >= 14.x
You can check if you have Node and NPM installed by running the following commands in your command-line window:
If you don’t have these,you’ll need to installnode. Installingnodealso installsnpmandnpxfor you. If you’re on macOS, you can install it withHomebrew:
Once you’ve installed Node and NPM, run the--versioncommands again to verify that they were installed correctly.
To get started with Typewriter in your browser:
Once you’ve gotanalytics.jsinstalled, add Typewriter as a developer dependency in your project:
Runnpx typewriter initto use the Typewriter quickstart wizard that generates atypewriter.ymlconfiguration, along with your first Typewriter client. When you run the command, it creates atypewriter.ymlfile in your project. For more information on the format of this file, see theTypewriter Configuration Reference.
 The command also adds a new Typewriter client in./analytics(or whichever path you configured). You can import this client into your project, like so:
### Configuration for snippet + TypeScript users
### Configuration for NPM users
Runnpx typewriterto regenerate your Typewriter client. You need to do this each time you update your Tracking Plan.
To help you minimize your bundle size, Typewriter supportstree-shakingusing named exports. All generated analytics calls generate and export automatically, so you can import them like so:
Typewriter wraps your analytics calls in anES6Proxy, which helps protect your application from crashing if you make analytics calls with a generated function that doesn’t exist. For example, if anOrder Completedevent didn’t exist in your Tracking Plan in the first example above, then your app would crash with aTypeError: typewriter.orderCompleted is not a function. However, since Typewriter dynamically proxies the underlying function calls, it can detect if a function doesn’t exist, and handle it for you. Typewriter logs a warning message, then fires anUnknown Analytics Call Firedevent into your source. This helps to prevent regressions when you migrate JavaScript projects to Typewriter in bulk. Keep in mind that proxying doesn’t work with named exports.

When you run the command, it creates atypewriter.ymlfile in your repo. For more information on the format of this file, see theTypewriter Configuration Reference.
Note:Runnpx typewriterto regenerate your Typewriter client. You need to do this each time you update your Tracking Plan.
Import your new Typewriter client into your project using XCode. If you place your generated files into a folder in your project, import the project as a group not a folder reference.
When you add the generated client to your Xcode Project you can use as a Swift extension method on any Analytics client object:
For use with theanalytics-androidSDK, useTypewriter v7.
To get started using Typewriter with Kotlin:
Typewriter creates the class file with the package nametypewriter. Segment recommends you to enter the right package name duringnpx typewriter initby choosing to review the Advanced Options for Kotlin. You can also enter the right package name directly intypewriter.yml:
Runnpx typewriterto regenerate your Typewriter client. You need to do this each time you update your Tracking Plan.
You can now use your Typewriter client in your Android Kotlin or Java application as extensions to anyAnalyticsobject:
Kotlin:
Java:
To get started with React Native:
Addtypewriteras a dev dependency in your project once you have the library installed in your project.
Runnpx typewriter initto use the Typewriter quickstart wizard that generates atypewriter.ymlconfiguration along with your first Typewriter client.
This command creates atypewriter.ymlfile in your repo. For more information on the format of this file, see theTypewriter Configuration Reference. The command also adds a new Typewriter / Segment client in./analytics(or whichever path you configured). You can use this interchangeably as a normal React Native Segment client. It contains additional methods for your tracking plan:
From there you can use it with hooks:
Or directly through the client:
Runnpx typewriterto regenerate your Typewriter client. You need to do this each time you update your Tracking Plan.
To update or add a new event to a Typewriter client, first apply your changes to your Tracking Plan. Then run the following:
Typewriter requires a Segment API token to fetch Tracking Plans from theSegment Public API.
You must be a workspace owner to create Segment API tokens.
To create an API token:
Typewriter looks for an API token in three ways, in the following order:
The quickstart wizard prompts you for an API token and stores it in~/.typewriterfor you.
Segment recommends you use aToken Scriptto share an API token with your team. When you use a token script, you can supply your API token as an environment variable (echo $TYPEWRITER_TOKEN), from an.env.file (source .env; echo $TYPEWRITER_TOKEN) or using any other CLI tool for providing secrets.
Segment also recommends you to pipe through your API Token as this will let you keep your token secret, but it also allows you to share it across your team.
Segment is temporarily keeping the Token Script execution for compatibility purposes. Segment might deprecate this feature in the future, and encourages you to execute your script and pipe in the token. For example,echo $TW_TOKEN | typewriter build.
To make the most of Typewriter, Segment recommends installing a few extensions:
JavaScript
Typewriter clients include function documentation adhering to theJSDocspecification. Install the relevant extension below for JSDoc support in your editor:
TypeScript
For intellisense in TypeScript clients, install the relevant extension below for TypeScript support in your editor. If your project is a mix between JavaScript and TypeScript, then you should also install the plugins in the JavaScript section above so that your editor will also support JSDoc intellisense.
iOS
XCode does not require any extra configuration and shows intellisense out-of-the-box.
Android
Android Studio does not require any extra configuration and shows intellisense out-of-the-box.
Segmentstrongly recommendsthat you store your Tracking Plan (plan.json) in a version control system. This guarantees that Typewriter will generate the same client, regardless of any changes you make to your Tracking Plan in the Segment app. Otherwise, changes to your Tracking Plan could lead to broken builds.
Segment recommends that you only check in theplan.json, and generate your Typewriter client during the application build step (by callingnpx typewriter). You can do this ingitwith the following.gitignore:
If this isn’t possible you can also check in the full generated client. Segment, however, doesn’t recommend this method.
Typewriter stores its configuration in atypewriter.ymlfile in the root of your repo. A sample configuration might look like this:
At any time, you can regenerate this file by running the Typewriter quickstart wizard:
Segment is keeping the Token Script execution for compatibility purposes only in v8 of Typewriter. Segment might deprecate this feature in the future, and encourages you to execute your script and pipe in the token. For example,echo $TW_TOKEN | typewriter build.
If your team has a standard way to supply secrets (passwords and tokens) in development environments, whether that’s an.envfile or an AWS-backed secret store, you can configure Typewriter to use it to get a Segment API token.
To configure this, create a token script calledscripts.tokenin yourtypewriter.yml. This script is a string that contains a shell command that, when executed, outputs a valid Segment API token. Here’s aninsecure, example:
To give a real example, Segment stores secrets insegmentio/chamberwhich is backed byAWS Parameter Store. Providing access to a token inchamberlooks like this:
To learn more about thetypewriter.ymlconfiguration format, see theConfiguration Reference.
In yourtypewriter.yml, you can configure a script (scripts.after) that fires after generating a Typewriter client. You can use this to apply your team’s style guide to any of Typewriter’s auto-generated files.
For example, if you want to apply yourprettierformatting toplan.json(the local snapshot of your Tracking Plan), you can use anafterscript like this:
To learn more about thetypewriter.ymlconfiguration format, see theConfiguration Reference.
As mentioned in theBest Practicessection above, Segment recommends that you only check in theplan.json, and not the generated clients, into your version control. Instead, Segment recommends building these clients as part of the build step for your application.
In your CI environment, this usually involves a step to build the Typewriter client. Make sure to build the production client before deploying the application, as explained in theTracking Plan Violation Handlingsection below.
You can also configure Typewriter to validate analytic events at runtime, which can alert you to instrumentation errors during development and testing. By default, Typewriter generates a “development” build, which means that it includes this logic. You can generate a “production” build that omits this logic:
Not all languages support run-time validation. Currently,analytics.jsandanalytics-nodesupport it usingAJV(both for JavaScript and TypeScript projects) whileanalytics-iosandanalytics-androiddo not yet support run-time validation. Typewriter also doesn’t support run-time validation using Common JSON Schema. For languages that don’t support run-time validation, the development and production clients are identical.
Segment recommends you to use a development build when testing your application locally, or when running tests. Segment generally recommendsagainstusing a development build in production, since this includes a full copy of your Tracking Plan which can increase the size of the application.
You can provide a custom handler that fires whenever a violation is seen. By default, this handler logs a warning.
Foranalytics.jsandanalytics-nodeclients, you can configure this handler withsetTypewriterOptions:
A common use case for this handler is to configure Typewriter to detect when your tests are running and if so, throw an error to fail your unit tests. For example:
Typewriter is preconfigured inanalytics-nodeenvironments to throw an error ifNODE_ENV=test, which is set by most Node.js testing libraries such asavaandjest.
Another common use case is to customize how violations are reported to your team. For example, Segment customized this handler to show atoast notificationto developers in-app:

Typewriter only supportstrackcalls. However, you can continue to use the underlying (untyped) analytics instance to performidentify,group,page,screen, andaliascalls.
Not all languages support run-time validation. Currently,analytics.jsandanalytics-nodesupport it usingAJV(both for JavaScript and TypeScript projects) whileanalytics-swiftandanalytics-kotlindon’t support run-time validation. Typewriter also does not support event validation using the Common JSON Schema.

Get started with Segment
Crawling: https://segment.com/docs/protocols/apis-and-extensions/anomaly_detection/
Paragraphs:
Protocols is available as an add-on for Business plans only.See theavailable plans, orcontact Support.
On this page
If you’re using Protocols, you might want to get notifications when an anomaly in event volumes orProtocols violationcounts occurs. This document clarifies what Segment means by anomaly detection, gives examples of anomalies that might be relevant to your business, and provides some example solutions of how to monitor and alert on anomalies using some standard tools available today.
Anomaly detection means finding out when your data collection is broken, missing, or incorrect.
When you first start using Protocols, you might focus on fixing data quality issues for a limited set of business critical events. After those first issues are resolved, you might get notifications if new issues occur or if old issues reoccur, so you can avoid manually monitoring data quality. New issues often occur when a new app version is released, and for many companies, that’s weekly.
The issues you care about for anomaly detection are different for each business. An anomaly for one company could be completely normal for another company. For example, an B2B company would expect a steep drop-off of traffic and event volume on weekends, while a media or entertainment company would expect to see a rise in activity in the evenings and on weekends for their different locales.
Other types of issues you can monitor for include:
There are several easy ways to set up anomaly detection using the destination partner tools you probably already use. Many of these solutions come from Segment customers using Protocols. They use these solutions to help manage data quality and get notified when relevant anomalies are detected.
You can send anomalous events directly from your source to a Slack channel using the Slack (Actions) destination. To get started:
If you’re not using the Slack (Actions) destination to forward violations, Segment recommends that you create a new Segment source to collect all violations and Segment workspace activity. To do this, create a new HTTP source in your workspace, and assign a name that you can easily understand (for example,Protocols Audit Source).
Next, set upViolation forwardingfor each Tracking Plan connected to the Source. Once connected, your sources will look like the following diagram:

Note: When you enable violation forwarding, it counts as 1 MTU toward your monthly MTU limit. If you are on an API plan, all forwarded violations count against your API limit. Violations might also generate costs in downstream destinations and data warehouses.
Once violation forwarding is enabled, you can build a custom anomaly detection solution that works for your business. The examples Segment covers here include:
After you’ve enabledViolation Forwarding,enable the Slack destinationfor your Protocols Audit Source. In the destination’s settings, add an Incoming Webhook URL for the Slack channel you want to push notifications to. Next, add theViolation Generatedevent to theEvent Templates settings.
You can copy and paste the example snippet below into the Event Template field to format the Slack message with the event name, violation description and source name. You can customize this message however you want, including adding @ mentions, and any of theproperties included in the Violation Generated event.
When you’re done, it’ll look like the screenshot below.

Custom dashboards are a great way to focus your teams around the metrics and events that matter most to your business. With a few simple queries you can build a dashboard to share with teams, so everyone can understand how well they’re doing against your data quality objectives. Here’s an example dashboard that combinesforwarded Violationswith production event data to track data quality. See below for detailed SQL queries.

Note: For all queries below, replaceprotocols_audit_sourcewith whatever schema name you set for your forwarded violations source.
Source-level event to violation count comparison:This query produces a table showing the total event and violation counts, along with a ratio of the two, broken out by day. A bar chart from this data can show when violations increase or decrease disproportionately to event volume in a source. This is the first place you would want to check to see if anomalies are occurring.
Ratio of High priority events to violation counts:This query produces a table showing all violations and event counts by day for a single event sent to Segment. A bar chart from this data can show when violations increase or decrease disproportionately to event volume for the single event. Segment recommends selecting a few events that are important for your business (for example,Order Completed,Video Viewed,User Signed Up) and creating a separate query and chart for each event.
Source-level distinct and total violation count (Last 7 days):
This query produces a table that lists all sources connected to a Tracking Plan. For each source, the table shows distinct violations and total violations seen in the source. This table is similar to theviolations summaryview in the Segment app.
Event violation count (Top 10):
This query produces a table listing the top 10 events with the most violations. A bar chart showing the worst offending events is a great way to focus your efforts on fixing the least reliable events.

You can subscribe to a variety of Protocols specific alerts through the workspace Activity Feed settings. To subscribe, visit your workspaceSettings>User Preferences>Activity Notifications>Protocols.
You can forward notifications from Protocols to a new Segment source, which can then send them to notification tools such as Slack webhook.
You can also forward these Protocols alerts to any (cloud-mode) Segment destination that accepts Track calls, including data warehouses. Most customers record these activity feed events to a data warehouse for analysis.
You can enableviolation event forwardingto start delivering violations as Track calls to a Segment source. From there, you can forward the events to any Segment destination that accepts Track calls.
You can also use the Slack Actions destination to set event triggers for context fields, meaning events with violations are sent as Track calls directly from the source.
Consent Managementusers see theSegment Consent Preference Updatedevent automatically added to all existing Tracking Plans after they create their first consent category, or when they create a new Tracking Plan after configuring Consent Management. Segment recommends that you do not remove this event.
To consolidate the views in the Schema tab, Segment automatically convertspageandscreencalls intoPage ViewedandScreen Viewedevents that appear in the Schema Events view. Segment recommends adding aPage ViewedorScreen Viewedevent to your Tracking Plan with any properties you want to validate against. At this time, to validate that a specific named page/screen (analytics.page('Homepage') | analytics.screen('Home')) has a specific set of required properties, you will need to use theJSON Schema.
Each Tracking Plan includes a Changelog, which shows which changes were made by which users. To view it, open a Tracking Plan, click the…button (also known as the dot-dot-dot, or ellipses menu) next to the Edit Tracking Plan button, and clickView Changelog.
The Tracking Plan to Source relationship is a one-to-many relationship. This means you can connect as many Sources to a Tracking Plan as you need. However Segment recommends connecting 1-3 Sources per Tracking Plan, because it’s rare to have more than three Sources that share an identical set of events, especially when tracking events across platforms. For example, many Segment mobile SDKs (iOS and Android) automatically collect events that would not make sense to collect in a web app. Segment doesn’t recommend including events in a Tracking Plan that would never be tracked in a Source.
You can duplicate Tracking Plans in the Segment web app by following theinstructions to copy a tracking plan. You can also use thePublic APIto copy the underlying JSON schema from one Tracking Plan to another.
Segment currently supports the ability tocreate multiple versions of an eventin a Tracking Plan. This is ideal for mobile apps, where a breaking change like adding a new required property to an event could cause all previous app versions on user devices to generate violations. You must manually add acontext.protocols.event_versionproperty to the specific track call so that Segment can correctly validate the event against the defined version. Learn more in theTracking Plan event versioning documentation.
In the Tracking Plan editor, click on the data type dropdown for a given property and toggle “Allow Null Values”. Enabling null values means onlynullvalues will be accepted for that property.
Yes.Tracking Plan Labelsare an excellent way to organize events in a Tracking Plan by priority, platform, product, or similar metadata for each event.
You can search in a Tracking Plan to find a specific event, and then copy the URL for the search results page and share it. You can also filter by label to share a group of events. The person you send the URL to must have access to the Workspace and tracking plan to see the results page. (Seethe Access Management documentationfor more details.)
Yes.Tracking Plan Librariesmakes it easy to create groups of events or properties that can be easily imported into multiple Tracking plans.
No. Unfortunately it’s not yet possible to automatically transfer events from a Tracking Plan to Libraries. To import events into a new event library, import them directly from a source.
Yes. Using thePublic API, you can copy the underlying JSON schema from a Tracking Plan in one Workspace to a Tracking Plan in another Workspace.
If youdiscarded eventsas a part of your original Tracking Plan, you must connect to the same Source and configure identical Schema Controls in your other Workspace so that blocked events behave as expected.
Unfortunately, Sources cannot be connected to more than one Tracking Plan. If you were able to connect more than one Tracking Plan to a Source, it could create conflict if events overlapped.
Segment’s code uses built-in logic to verify if an event exists in the Tracking Plan. If an event does not exist, it will follow the configuration theSchema Configuration settingsfor each source connected to the Tracking Plan.
Unplanned property omission is only supported for cloud-mode destinations. Unplanned properties will not be omitted when they’re sent to device-mode destinations.
When you access a Tracking Plan, you’ll come across two IDs:tp_andrs_. Segment uses the two IDs to identify your Tracking Plan in the two APIs you can use to manage your workspace: thePublic APIand theConfig API.
To view the two IDs for your Tracking Plan, navigate to the Tracking Plan you’d like to view the ID for and select the dropdown next toTracking Plan ID.
If you’re using the Public API, you’ll need the ID that starts withtp_.
If you’re using the Config API, you’ll need the ID that starts withrs.
When you first create your Tracking Plan, you can add events from your Source Schema by selecting theImport events from Sourcebutton on the Tracking Plan editor page. You can manually add these events after you’ve connected your Source Schema to your Tracking Plan by clicking the (+) next to the event on your Source Schema page.
When you initially create your Tracking Plan, you can import events into it from a Source Schema. Manually add these events by clicking the the (+) next to the event in your Source Schema page after connecting your Tracking Plan.
You cannot recover a deleted Tracking Plan and Segment cannot recover it on your behalf. Please delete Tracking Plans with caution.
Violations Daily DigestThe Violations Daily Digest is a great way to keep informed of new violations that might be easy to overlook on the Protocols Violations page. The digest sends one email digest per source, every day at approximately 12AM EST. You cannot currently opt in or out of specific sources.
The digest contains all violations for that source that areuniquein the previous 48 hours. For example, if an eventtestEventhad violations on the first day of the month, then those violations won’t appear in the digest until the third of the month.
The email includes information about the violation to help you track down its source and correct it. It includes the event name and property name fields, the violation type, the number of times that specific type of violation was seen, and the last time it was seen.
Protocols Violations PageThe Protocols Violations page shows a live count for violations. You can adjust the timeframe to show violations in the last hour, the last 24 hours, or the last seven days.
You might see a difference between the count on the Violations page and the count in the Violations email digests. This can happen due to differences between the time periods available (24 hours in in the live page, 48 hours in the daily digest email), and the fact that the digest only showsuniqueviolations. The fields displayed on the Violations page are more detailed than those included in the email digest.
You may see violations related to (root). For example:
These violations are related to your common JSON Schema if you’ve applied custom rules. In this instance (root), refers to the top level of the JSON object (Segment event).
The schema functionality is areactiveway to clean up your data, where the Tracking Plan functionality is aproactive, intentional way to clean and unify all future data. Segment has found that the best data driven companies invest the time required to build strong processes and controls around their data. The investment pays off exponentially.
That being said, there are plenty of scenarios where the reactive Schema functionality solves immediate needs for customers. Often times, customers will use both Schema Controls and Tracking Plan functionality across their Segment Sources. For smaller volume Sources with less important data, the Schema functionality often works perfectly.
Blocked events are blocked from sending to all Segment Destinations, including warehouses and streaming Destinations. When an Event is blocked using a Tracking Plan, it does not count towards your MTU limit. They will, however, count toward your MTU limit if you enableblocked event forwardingin your Source settings.
Segment doesn’t store unplanned properties and properties omitted due to JSON Schema Violations in Segment logs. Segment drops omitted properties from the events. You can find the omitted properties in thecontext.violationsobject of an event payload. If you forward Violations to a new source, then you can also see the omitted properties in the Violation Generated event underviolationFieldin thepropertiesobject.
Segment only stores fully blocked events for 30 days.
If you’re seeing unplanned properties/traits in your payload despite using Schema Controls, you might want to select a new degree of blocking controls.
Segment’sSchema Controlsprovide three options to omit properties/traits. Select the one that aligns with your requirements:
The source schema only validates events against the oldest event version in a Tracking Plan. If, for example, you have a version 1 and version 2 of your Tracking Plan, the schema only checks against version 1 of your Tracking Plan.
Blocking events within aSource SchemaorTracking Planexcludes them from API call and MTU calculations, as the events are discarded before they reach the pipeline that Segment uses for calculations.
Warehouse connectors don’t use data type definitions for schema creation. Thedata typesfor columns are inferred from the first event that comes in from the source.
You can only use schema controls to block events at the point that they are ingested into Segment. When you forward an event that Segment has previously ingested from another source, that event bypasses the pipeline that Segment uses to block events and cannot be blocked a second time.
If you create a destination scoped transformation and request a replay for that destination, the transformation will transform events into the destination. Segment doesn’t recommended requesting a replay to resend events to a destination as that will likely result in duplicate events in the destination.
To reduce the risk of creating circular and conflicting transformations, Segment only allows a single transformation to be created for each distinct source, event, destination and type pairing. That means you cannot create twoRename track eventtransformations for aorder_completedevent. This eliminates the possibility of different stakeholders creating conflicting transformations to satisfy their own needs. It also simplifies the Transformations list view, making it much easier to sort and filter by source, event, destination, etc.
In early transformations prototypes, Segment allowed users to select multiple events and destinations for a single transformation rule. Segment realized, however, that this created a structure that was impossible to scale, and likely to generate unintended consequences. For example, if Segment allows multiple track events to be selected for a property name change, it’d be possible to create conflicting changes. Instead, by enforcing a single event, Segment can check to see if a transformation rule exists and smartly link you to that rule using a warning.
Only workspace admins are allowed to create transformations.
All users with Protocols admin or read-only permissions can view transformations.
Transformations introduce advanced logic that at scale may impact performance of client-side libraries. If you are interested in testing new functionality which supports device-mode destination transformations in analytics.js, contact your account rep.
That depends. If you are working with source-level Transformations, the Protocols conversion will come first. If you are dealing with a destination scoped transformation (which is set to only impact data going to a specific destination), Destination Filters will be applied prior to Protocols Transformations.
Transformations are but one tool among many to help you improve data quality. Segment highly recommends that all customers interested in improving data quality start with a well defined Tracking Plan. The Tracking Plan serves as a roadmap for how you want to collect data. Without a clear roadmap, it’s nearly impossible to build alignment around how transformations should be used to improve data quality, leading to more data quality issues than it solves.
Transformations are not applied to events sent through theEvent Tester. The Event Tester operates independently from the Segment pipeline, focusing solely on testing specific connections to a destination. For a transformation to take effect, the event must be processed through the Segment pipeline.
This error occurs because there is a limit of 200 rules per API update. This restriction is by design to ensure stable API performance. Segment is not able to increase this limit on your behalf. To work around this, split your update into smaller batches, each with 200 or fewer rules.

On this page
When you first log in, you go to your workspace. (If you’re a member of several workspaces, you get to choose which one to go to.) Workspaces organize sets of sources and destinations into a central location.
Want a video tour of the Segment workspace? Head over to Segment University! (Must be logged in to access.)
A workspace is a group of sources that can be administered and billed together. Workspaces help companies manage access for multiple users and data sources. Workspaces let you collaborate with team members, add permissions, and share sources across your whole team using a shared billing account.
When you first log in to your Segment account, you can create a new workspace, or choose to log into an existing workspace if your account is part of an existing organization.
This is a Segment workspace.

The first thing you see is a graph of the sources and destinations you have connected to Segment. Sources send data to your workspace: these are your mobile apps, server sources, and website-based sources. Destinations are tools which get the data, and can also include warehouses, which just store large amounts of data for later reuse and analysis.
The graph on this overview page includes lines which can show you which sources send data to which destinations. If this is the first time you’re looking at your workspace and you haven’t set it up yet, it won’t look quite like this.
In the left navigation bar, you see the main parts of the Segment application:Sources,Destinations,Privacy,Engage, andProtocols, if your subscription includes them.
You can also find the Catalog in the left navigation, which lists the sources you can collect data from, and the destinations you can send data to.
You can always click the Segment logo in the top left corner to get back to the Overview page.

The Sources tab lists everything that is sending data to your Segment workspace. Sources are organized by type: website, mobile, sever, or by cloud-app type, like CRM or payments.
Each source has a status and a list of destinations. A source’s status tells you whether or not the source is sending data to Segment, and how long it’s been since Segment last saw data from the source. The source’s destinations list shows you which destinations are receiving data from that source. You can expand them for more detail.

The Destination tab lists all of the destinations connected to your workspace. These are sorted into categories like analytics, email marketing, and other tool types. The list also shows whether or not Segment is sending data to that tool, or if the tool is enabled or disabled.

Next up is the Catalog. The catalog includes a list of allsourcesanddestinationsavailable in Segment. You can search either by category or name. When you click on a catalog tile, the tile shows instructions on how to connect the tool to your Segment workspace.
The Catalog is always growing, so check out the “New and Noteworthy” section from time to time to see what’s new.
If you have Engage or Protocols enabled in your workspace, you’ll see sections for those too. Engage helps you use your Segment data to build audiences and better understand your users, and Protocols helps you structure and maintain the format of the data you send through Segment.
These features are fairly advanced, but you can learn more about them byrequesting a demo, or reading more in theEngage documentation, and theProtocols documentation.
TheWorkspace Settingstab shows more information about your workspace, including your team settings, GDPR requests, and so on. You might not have access to edit these settings.
TheUser Preferencestab shows your individual account settings, including Notification settings.
TheActivity Notificationsfeature in Notification settings provides alerts for specific workspace activities when enabled. These alerts keep you updated on actions taken by other workspace users, excluding activities you initiate. This ensures you’re only alerted to actions you’re not directly involved in.
TheUsagetab shows how many API calls orMonthly Tracked Users (MTUs)your workspace has used this month - which can be important for keeping an eye on your Segment bill.
TheHealthtab lists any repeated or consistent errors, which can help alert you to misconfigurations or data issues which you can correct.
Issues on the Health tab are sorted by Sources, Destinations, Warehouses, and again by type.

If errors are present, they’re sorted by type and include information about how long ago they were last seen and how many times they’ve occurred. You can click the wrench icon on an individual error line to view the Event Delivery tool and see the erroring payload and response. You can also disable or delete the erroring integration from this menu.
The Privacy Portal allows you to inspect data coming into your Segment account, check it for Personally Identifying Information (PII), classify it based on how sensitive the information is, and then determine which categories of data to send to different destinations. Read more about these tools in thePrivacy Portal documentation.

Paragraphs:
On this page
Segment’s Workspace Home serves as a dashboard that gives you a single consolidated view of the workspace, its health and status, and metrics for specific integrations over time.
Availability
The Workspace Home is visible to users who have the Workspace Ownerrole. If you have access to the Home page, it is the first screen you see when you log in to your Segment Workspace.
The Home page shows a summary of errors in the workspace’s sources and destinations, a list of “favorite” integrations that you can configure, and information about recent audit logged events, and your billing plan usage.

The Workspace Home page shows when the data it represents was last updated. You can click theUpdatedline to refresh the display.
You can also use the drop-down menu at the right to choose between a 24-hour and 7-day rolling view of the data. The page automatically updates the graphs and statistics when you change your selection.
The Sources section of the Home pages shows a summary of the event volume flowing through Segment.
If your Segment plan includes Protocols, the dashboard showsEvent Violationsoccurring in the workspace, including a graph over time. You can click into the violations section to see a list of sources ordered from highest number of violations, to lowest. You can click into individual sources to see more details and go to their individual source pages, orgo to the Violations page.

If your Segment plan does not include Protocols, an Events Received chart is shown to reflect the number of events received across sources.
The Destinations section of the Home page shows a summary of the Event Delivery for the workspace, including a graph over time. You can click thedestinationslink to see a list of destinations with delivery problems, ordered from highest to lowest error rate. You can click a destination to see more details about the delivery failures, and from the details panel click the destination name to go directly to its configuration page.

If you have access to the Workspace Home page, you can customize it for yourself by bookmarking or saving “favorite” integrations. These could be sources, destinations, storage destinations, and functions that you work with regularly, or want to monitor closely.
These Home page favorites are specific to your user account in the workspace. The are not shared among administrators in the same workspace, and are not accessible from other workspaces you might be an administrator for.
To create a favorite, clickAdd Favoriteor the plus icon, and select the integration(s) to bookmark. The list that appears displays a status icon for each integration, so you can tell which ones are healthy (green) and unhealthy (red), and which ones are inactive (gray).
Once you create a favorite, the section displays your favorites in tabs so you can view sources only, destinations only (including storage destinations), or all of them at once. Each favorite displays important configuration details and summary statistics for that integration. You can click themore(…) menu to jump directly to one of the configuration or detail pages for that integration.
To delete a favorite, click themore(…) menu and selectRemove favorite.
For users with Business Tier workspaces, the recent activity section displays the most recent items logged to the Segment Audit trail. This includes workspace membership changes and requests, changes to the configuration of different Segment features (including sources, destinations, and to Engage and Protocols configurations), and data storage sync failures.
The Usage section shows a summary of the workspace’s plan utilization for the current billing period. This includes billing information for all parts of your Segment plan. This includesMTUs or API call volume(as applicable), Functions usage time (if applicable), and Engage details (if applicable). Clickview allto go to the workspace’s billing page for more detailed statistics.

On this page
Segment’s access management tools let Workspace Owners manage which users can access different parts of their Segment workspaces. The Access Management page has three tabs:Users (team members),User Groups, andTokens.
Access settings are applied at the workspace level. A Segment user can have access to one or more workspaces and can have differentrolesin each workspace.
Users access their Segment account with either email/password credentials, theirTwilio credentials, or by usingSingle Sign On.
Workspace Ownerscan download a CSV list of users who have access to a specific workspace (including their roles) from the Access Management page in the Segment app.
You can select a user in the table to see theirroles. Check out theRoles documentationfor more details.
With Twilio Unified Login, Twilio users can use their Twilio email, password, and authentication settings to access several Twilio products, including Twilio Messaging, SendGrid, and Segment. You can also use Sign up With Google to create your Twilio account. Once you link your Segment account to your Twilio credentials, you can access Segment directly from the Twilio console using theTwilio Product Switcher.
Segment invitations and sign ups that are redirected to Twilio’s sign up page must adhere to Twilio’sminimum password and 2FA requirements. To learn more, view Twilio’sAccount Managementdocumentation.
Any existing Segment user must adhere to existing password requirements and 2FA settings set at the Workspace level.
You can access Segment from the Twilio Console using the Product Switcher. For more information, view the Twilio support articleGetting Started with the Unified Login and Product Switcher.
Twilio Unified Login users can manage their Segment user settings, including name, email, password, and 2FA settings, directly in their Twilio account. To learn more about Twilio’s user and password policies, review Twilio’sAccount Managementdocumentation.
Existing Segment users can still use their credentials to access Segment.
Segment continues to supportSSOand SCIM, as users who need to access an SSO enabled workspace will be directed to authenticate through the configured Identity Provider.

A SegmentTeam Memberis an individual with access to a workspace. A Segment user can be associated with one or more workspaces, either as anownerormemberof each.
Check out theroles documentationfor a complete list of roles.
The user session for a Segment Team Member is 7 days. Team Members in aHIPAA eligible workspacehave a 15 minute user session across all workspaces.
If you are a Team Member in a HIPAA eligible workspace and want to access a non-HIPAA eligible workspace with a 7 day user session, you can create an alias (for examplename+workspace@gmail.com).
AUser Groupis a set of Team Members with a set of shared policies. A Segment Team Member can be a member of one or many Groups. All roles in the Segment App are additive, which means that group membership can be assigned in addition to individual roles for a single team member. For example, a single user could inherit roles from a Group definition AND have access to additional resources through individually assigned roles.
You can generate tokens to programmatically access Segment resources using theSegment Public API.

Resources are the building blocks of Segment, and represent the different parts of your Segment deployment to which you can grant access. These include:
Workspace owners can use Labels to grant users access to groups of resources. When you add a Label to a Source or Spaces, any users who are granted access to that Label gain access to those resources.
To create or configure labels, go to theLabelstab in your workspace settings. Only workspace Owners can manage labels for the entire workspace.

Paragraphs:
On this page
A role gives a user access to resources within a workspace. Roles are additive, and can combine to configure a custom policy for a Team Member or a Group. A policy is at least one role plus one resource applied to an individual user or group.
When a user has both User Permissions and Group Permissions, they will have the highest access given to either of those roles.
All Segment workspaces have the following roles, regardless of account type.
The following roles are only available to Segment Business Tier accounts.
Full edit and view access to all entity models and connection details.
Read-only access, with the ability to view entity models.
The Segment App doesn’t show detected Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to workspace members if the information matches specific expected formats for PII. When PII Access turnsoff, detected PII is masked based onred or yellow default matchersand anycustom matchersdefined in the Privacy Portal.
Workspace Owners can grant specific individuals or groups access to PII from their Access Management settings. PII Access only applies to the resources a user or user group has access to; it doesn’t expand a user’s access beyond the original scope. All Workspace Owners have PII access by default.
For example, users with PII Access and Source Admin/Read-Only permissions can view any PII present in the Source Debugger. However, users with the PII Access role don’t have Privacy Portal access.
Only users with the Workspace Owner role can access the Privacy Portal.
When managing destination connections in an Engage space, you may require additional permissions.
To connect two resource instances, you must have access to both. You can either grant this access to all resources, or to the specific resources you want to connect.
To connect a source to warehouseyou must haveSource AdminandWarehouse Adminaccess for the source and the warehouse.
To connect source to tracking planrequiresSource AdminandTracking Plan Adminaccess for the source and the tracking plan.
Toviewtransformations, you needSource Read-only, either for all Sources or the specific Sources using Protocols.

This page explains how to addTeam MembersandUser Groupsto your team’s workspace, how to assign themroles, and how to remove them.
Note: Only Workspace Owners can change a workspace’s Access Management settings.
Note: Workspaces that are on Free or Team plans can only grant theworkspace ownerandsource adminroles.
Tip: You can also grant the role for all current and future resources. For admin roles, this includes the ability to create new resources.
Workspace Owners can manage permissions for groups of team members who should have similar access using “user groups”.
You can make changes to group membership from two places in the Segment App: From the Edit Team Member page (the user’s individual access page), and from the Edit User Group page, where you can see all members of the group.

To add a team member from theEdit Team Memberpage:
Tip: This method is best when adding asingleteam member to one or more user groups.

To add a team member from theEdit User Grouppage:
Tip: This method is best when adding more than one user to a single user group at the same time
Open the member details and clickRemove Team Memberat the top.
If you are on a Business plan and choose to use Single Sign On (SSO), you grant implicit access to your workspace by assigning team members access to Segment from your identity provider. By default, you grant these usersminimal workspace access.
Segment supports “Just-In-Time” user provisioning using SSO. Any users with access to the application as defined in your IDP can seamlessly create a Segment account when they first log in. By default, all automatically-provisioned users created this way are created as Workspace Members with Minimal Workspace Access.
Once they have been created, Workspace Owners can update these users’ access from theAccess Managementpage in the Segment App.
Segment does not support programmatic de-provisioning at this time. However, if your workspace uses SSO, a user that cannot authenticate to your IDP cannot view or edit any of your workspaces or their contents.
If you are aworkspace member, you might encounter a section of the Segment App that you do not have access to view. If you need expanded permissions, you can request access directly in the Segment App. Once submitted, Access requests are sent to all workspace owners by email.
To review an access request, workspace owners click the link in the access request email to go to their workspace’s Access Management Settings. The requestor’s access request message appears on the Segment Access Management page, and the workspace owner can adjust the user’s permissions. The access request message disappears after the permissions are updated.
When you send an invitation to an incorrect email address or the token included in the email invite link expires, the invite might still show up as “Invite Pending” in the Segment App. In these cases, you can revoke the invite to remove it and resend the invite if needed. The invitation will expire within a few days. Therefore, if a user accepts an invite with an expired link, Segment does not grant them access.

Crawling: https://segment.com/docs/segment-app/iam/labels/
Paragraphs:
Advanced Access Management is available for all Business plans.See theavailable plans, orcontact Support.
On this page
Labels allow workspace owners to assign permissions to users to grant them access to groups. Groups represent collections of Sources, or collections of Spaces.
To create or configure labels, go to theLabelstab in your workspace settings. Only workspace Owners can manage labels for the entire workspace.
All workspaces include labels forDev(development) andProd(production) environments. Business Tier customers can create an unlimited number of labels.
By default, all workspaces include labels for Dev (development) and Prod (production) environments. Workspace owners can configure what these labels are applied to, and can create up to five custom environments.
Labels must be inkey:valueformat, both the key and value must begin with a letter, and they can only contain letters, numbers, hyphens or dashes.
To apply labels to Sources and Spaces, click theAssign Labelstab from the Labels screen. In the screen that appears, select the Sources and Spaces to apply the label to.
Once a label is in use (either assigned to a resource or used to restrict permissions on a user), the label cannot be deleted. You must first manually remove the label from any resources and permissions before you can delete it.
While only Workspace Owners can bulk-edit labels, Source and Space admins can edit the labels on the sources and spaces they have access to. To do this, go to theSettingstab for each item.
Workspace owners can also grant specificRolesaccess to specific labels. For example, you might give a Source Admin access to only Sources that have theProdlabel.
Permissions can then be assigned to users in Access Management by label, on the Source Admin, Source Read-Only, Engage Admin, Engage User and Engage Read-Only users.

Note: All Segment workspaces can create up to five custom labels. Additional label types (in addition to environment labels) are available to Segment Business Tier accounts.
To create additional custom labels, a workspace owner can create new key types in the Labels screen. The workspace owner can customize any combination of labels to mirror how resources should be partitioned in their organization. For example, some organizations may prefer to restrict access on their Sources and Spaces by brand or product area while other organizations may find it more useful to restrict their resources by tech stack or engineering department.
When you create a new key, it becomes available in the Sources page as a column type that can be used to organize sources.
Workspace owners can create labels for sources and Spaces from the Segment workspaceSettings->Admin->Labels.
Labels currently only apply to Sources and Spaces.
Workspace owners can assign bulk assign labels to sources and Spaces using the “Assign Labels” tab in theLabelsscreen. Source admins and Space admins can edit the labels on their individual resources in the “Settings” tab.
Once a label has been created and has been assigned to resources within the workspace, workspace owners can use these labels to restrict permissions on user access, restrict which sources can be connected to a space through a Connection Policy, and organize sources by viewing these labels as columns in the Sources page.
Workspace owners can only delete a label if it is not being used (either assigned to a resource or used to restrict permissions on a user). First, manually remove the label from any resources or user permissions.
No, a label cannot be renamed. If you need to rename a label, we recommend you create the new label, and then assign it to all resources named the old label before deleting the old label.
(for example, a source as both brand:A and brand:B))
No, you can only assign one value per category. This is to ensure there is no confusion in logic around permissions. For example, if a user is assigned permission to brand:A, it would be unclear to the workspace owner if this user gets access to a source labeled bothbrand:Aandbrand:Bor only sources with the sole labelbrand:A.
Labels are additive, so you can only further restrict a user’s permissions by adding more labels. If a user has access to everything labeled environment:production, we assume no restrictions on any other category of label. This user has less restricted permissions than another user who has access to everything withenvironment:productionANDregion:apac.
For example, if the following sources had these set of labels:
Then the following through users with Source Admin restricted with Labels will only have access to the following Sources:
You can only assign one set of additive labels on a per-user basis. However, to give a user who needs access to all sources labeledbrand:aorbrand:b, we recommend that you use Group permissions and assign this user to two separate groups, where one group has Source Admin access tobrand:aand the other has Source Admin access tobrand:b.

Crawling: https://segment.com/docs/segment-app/iam/audit-trail/
Paragraphs:
Audit Trail is only available in Business plan workspaces.See theavailable plans, orcontact Support.
On this page
The Audit Trail allows you to view the last 90 days of user and system activity, filter activity for specific actions or actors, and export your data to an event streams source or CSV file.
For any requests exceeding the 90-day timeframe, contactSegment Supportfor assistance.
Viewing the Audit Trail requires Workspace Owner permissions
You must have the Workspace Owner role to view the Audit Trail page. For more information about roles and permissions within Segment, see theRoles documentation.
To view the Audit Trail:
The Audit Trail returns information about the following Segment product areas:
To view a list of all events Segment surfaces in the Audit Trail, open the Audit Trail, clickFilters, and select theEventsdropdown.
Use the Filters dropdown to refine your search results and filter by actions or actors to see who made changes on specific resources in the app. Actors include both logged-in users and access tokens.
You can forward events in your workspace to anevent streams sourceto set up real-time alerts and quickly revert changes (like a user unintentionally disabling a warehouse) that could cause unwanted downstream effects.
Segment recommends creating a dedicated source for Audit Trail events
Segment recommends forwarding all events to an instance of theHTTP APIsource.  Segment passes all forwarded events through its entire processing pipeline. This ensures that Tracking Plans, Filters, and other features work with the audit events, and also ensures you can send those events to multiple downstream destinations.
To forward Audit Trail events to an event streams source:
When you forward audit events to a source, Segment passes those events through its entire processing pipeline. This ensures that tracking plans, filters, and other features work with the audit events, and also ensures you can send those events to multiple downstream destinations.
An audience/computed trait Run or a Sync may fail on its first attempt, but Engage will retry up to 5 times before considering it a hard failure and display on that audience/compute trait’s Overview page. As long as the runs/syncs within the specific Audience’s Overview page say they are successful, then these can be safely ignored.
How things work internally:Segment Engage scheduler fetches audiences/traits from compute service and then handles the logic of generating tasks. These compute/sync tasks get scheduled and executed by another worker. Essentially, these tasks are a list of steps to be executed. Each task has a series of steps that are marked as complete by saving a timestamp for the completion. If the worker is disrupted, it picks up at the latest step, which has no completed_at timestamp. In some cases, the step may fail or the entire task may fail (for example, due to timeout or the worker disruption as there are many moving parts). In either case, these failures will be retried.
These tasks are a part of internal Segment process, and there are systems in place to retry failed tasks. In most cases, it is not necessary to track these failures, as long as there are no actual computation or sync failures.
The Audit Trail logic, however, is configured to notify you about every task failure, even if it then later succeeds.
If you would like to avoid receiving the notifications for transient failures,reach out to supportto request enabling a setting to reduce the number of notifications your workspace receives.

Get started with Segment
Crawling: https://segment.com/docs/segment-app/iam/sso/
Paragraphs:
Single Sign-on is only available in Business plan workspaces.See theavailable plans, orcontact Support.
On this page
Segment supports Single Sign On for Business Tier accounts. You can use any SAML-based Identity Provider (IdP), for example Okta, Bitium, OneLogin, or Centrify, or use GSuite to serve as your identity provider, delegating access to the application based on rules you create in your central identity management solution.
With SSO, you have centralized control over your users’ ability to authenticate or not in your IdP. You can also enforce rules like two-factor authentication or password rotation at the IdP level.
You can configure as many IdP connections to your workspace as needed to support IdP-initiated authentication. This allows seamless migration from one system to a new one, if, for example, your organization switches IdP vendors or switches from GSuite to a dedicated SAML IdP like Okta or OneLogin.
To enable SSO-based login from the Segment login page (app.segment.com/login), you must first verify that you own the domain, and connect it to your organization’s Segment account. After you have done that, SSO users from your domain can use the Segment login page to access your default Segment workspace.
The Segment login page can only be connected to one workspace. To use your IdP with multiple workspaces, you will have to initiate login to the other workspaces from the IdP instead of through the login portal.
Segment’s SSO configuration is entirely self-service. Additionally, Segment has prebuilt connections withOkta,OneLogin, andMicrosoft Entra IDwhich can help you get set up faster.Reach out to supportif you run into any questions or issues.
To get started, go to your workspace settings and navigate toAuthentication > Connections > Add new Connection. Follow the steps to create a SAML connection.


Segment officially supports apps for Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, and OneLogin. Next, find Segment in your IdP’s app catalog, and follow the set up instructions they provide.
If you’re using a different IdP, you must create a custom SAML-based application.
Your provider will ask you for a few things from Segment, which Segment provides in the setup flow:

For GSuite configurations, make sure theStart URLfield in Service Provider Details is left blank.
Different IdPs have different names for the Audience URL. Some call it “Audience URI”, some call it “Entity ID”, some call it “Service Provider Entity ID.” It’s likely there are only two required fields without correct defaults, and they correspond to theSSO URLandAudience URLvalues above.
In all IdPs Segment works with, the defaultNameIDoption is the correct one. Make sure it’s using theemailAddressschema.
In all IdPs Segment works with, the default connection encryption options are the correct ones. (Signed Response & Assertion Signature with SHA256, Unencrypted Assertions).
Different IdPs store records of your employees differently. The only attribute mapping Segment requires is to make sure you’re sendingemail. In Okta this is atuser.email. In Duo this ismail.
Make sure you’ve enabled “send all attributes” (not just NameID) if applicable for your IdP.
NoRelayStateis required. This is also sometimes calledTarget.
After you create the application in your IdP, you can come back to Segment and click “Next”.
Your IdP provides a URL and x.509 certificate. Copy them into their respective fields in Segment.

Then, click “Configure Connection.”
You’re all set.
Back at the connections page, make sure your connection is enabled with the switch on the right.

You can now test using IdP-initiated SSO (by clicking login to Segment from within your IdP) is working correctly. If not, double check the IdP configuration gotchas section above.
For most customers, Segment recommends requiring SSO for all users. If you do not require SSO, users can still log in with a username and password. If some members cannot log in using SSO, Segment also supports SSO exceptions.
These options are off by default, but you can configure them on theAdvanced Settingspage. Log in using SSO to toggle theRequire SSOsetting.

To configure GSuite for use with Segment, go to your workspace settings and choose the “Connections” tab under “Authentication” and click “Add New Connection.” Follow the steps to create a “Google Apps For Work” connection.
Enter your domain (or, if you’ve verified it already, choose it from the dropdown) and then click the resulting link to authorize the connection.
Segment supports SSO on the login page for emails that match your workspace’s domain.
In order to enable this, you’ll need to verify your domain with Segment. To do that, go to the “Domains” tab under “Authentication” in the workspace settings page.

Enter your domain and click “Add Domain.” When you click verify, you’re given two options to verify your domain, either using a meta tag to add to your/index.htmlat the root, or a DNS text record that you can add through your DNS provider. After you do so and click verify, you can move to the next step.
Domain tokens expire 14 days after they are verified.
To configure SSO for multiple workspaces, your admin must configure access to each workspace as a separate app in your identity provider. You are unable to use verified domain(s) across multiple workspaces and will encounter the following error if you add a domain that is already verified in another workspace:
Warning: This domain has already been claimed.
After your administrator configures separate apps for each workspace in your IdP, the end-users can log in to the IdP and click on the relevant app for the workspace you are trying to access. This is also referred to as IdP-initiated SSO.
The Okta/Segment SAML integration supports the following features:
For more information on these features, visit theOkta Glossary.
To set up the Okta/Segment SAML integration, you’ll first carry out several steps in Segment, then finish in Okta.
Follow these steps in Segment to set up the Okta/Segment SAML integration:

Finish setting up the Okta/Segment SAML integration by carrying out these steps in Okta:

You’ve now completed setup. For SP-initiated SSO, follow these steps:
Segment supports “just in time” user permissioning; new users who authenticate using your IdP are automatically created in Segment as minimal-access (read-only) members. If the user already exists in Segment then Segment associates the IdP-identity with the existing Segment user account. Segment also supports user provisioning and role mappingusing SCIM.
Yes, users can be automatically de-provisionedif you use SCIM.
Segment allows users to own their own workspaces. While your IdP authentication will ensure that any non-owners must have logged in with SSO to accessyour workspace, they can still log into Segment with a username and password to access their own workspaces.
Workspace owners can invite additional owners with any domain using the traditional invite mechanism. If the workspace is configured to require SSO, and the user is not on your IdP, you can add an Exemption underWorkspace Settings > Authentication > Advanced Settings.
After SSO is configued to access multiple workspaces, you will have slightly different signin experience in the below scenarios

Crawling: https://segment.com/docs/segment-app/iam/scim/
Paragraphs:
Single Sign-on is only available in Business plan workspaces.See theavailable plans, orcontact Support.
On this page
The SCIM specification is designed to make managing user identities in cloud-based applications like Segment easier. SCIM allows your Identity Provider (IdP) to manage users and groups within your Segment workspace.
Most IdPs offer SCIM, and it complements SAML. You can think of SAML as a way for your employees to authenticate and SCIM as a way to make sure they have the appropriate permissions.
Before you start, remember that SSO is only available to Business Tier customers, and that only workspace owners may configure SSO connections.
To set up SCIM, you must first create an SSO connection. Once youcreate your SSO connection, log back in to Segment using SSO.
Segment officially supportsOkta,Microsoft Entra ID, andOneLogin. Each link includes specific setup instructions for that IdP. You should read thefeaturessection of this page to understand which features of SCIM Segment supports.
You may still be able to use SCIM with another Identity Provider (IdP) by adapting the following instructions.
Your IdP needs to know where to send SCIM requests. The Segment base URL is: https://scim.segmentapis.com/scim/v2
The other value you need is an API key (sometimes referred to as an Authorization Header). To generate one, go toSettings > Advanced Settingsin the Segment app, and find theSSO Syncsection. ClickGenerate SSO Tokenand copy the generated token. Use this token for the API key or Authorization Header in your IdP.
You can find this page in thesettings sidebar of your Segment app.

It’s important to remember that Segment has a multi-tenant user/workspace relationship, meaning that users can be part of more than one workspaces. In most cases these workspaces are all related to a single customer (for example, a single company might have individual workspaces for different brands or subsidiaries). However, some users can be members of workspaces for different Segment customers, such as with contractors or consultants.
Because of this, Segment must balance the autonomy of users with the desired level of control of a Workspace Owner.
Even though Segment users exist separately from workspaces, your IdP can create a new Segment user or add an existing Segment user to your workspace using the same IdP workflow. This process is transparent to the IdP and to you as the customer. In other words, you don’t need to know if a user exists before adding them to your workspace.
If the person you want to add does not have a Segment account, your IdP will create one. If the person already has a Segment account, you can still add them to your Workspace using your IdP, but itdoes not create a new Segment account.
You can create new users and set theiruserName(email) anddisplayName(single value field that represents a user’s full name) using your IdP.
If a user already has a Segment account, you can add them using their email address using your IdP. However, Segment ignores thedisplayNamesent by the IdP, and instead uses the name chosen by the user when they created their account.
Segment user profiles only contain auserName(email) anddisplayName. Once you create a user, you cannot update these attributes using SCIM. They can only be updated by the user through the Segment UI.
Segment workspace ownerscannotdeleteSegment workspace member accounts using SCIM, the web UI, or the Segment API. A user must delete their own account using the Segment app. Workspace ownerscanremove members from the workspaceusing SCIM, the web UI, or the Segment API.
Some IdPs want to set users as “inactive” or “active.” Segment does not have an “inactive” state for user accounts. Similar functionality can be achieved by removing a user from your workspace. Setting an existing Segment user to “active” is similar to adding that user to the workspace.
When your IdP updates a user to setactive: false, or attempts to delete a user, Segment removes the user from your Segment workspace. If your IdP attempts to create a user with an existing email, or setactive: trueon an existing user, Segment adds that existing user account to your workspace.
Any Segment group membershipsmust be reassignedwhen a user is removed and re-added from your workspace. Newly added workspace users have the “Minimal Workspace Access” permission by default. The “Minimal Workspace Access” role does not have access to any sources, destinations, etc.
This reassignment might happen automatically depending on how you configured your IdP. If the user was assigned groups using your IdP, your IdP should automatically re-add the user within Segment. For this reason, Segmentstronglyrecommends that you create groups in your IdP, push them into Segment, and maintain an active link between your IdP and Segment.
Your IdP can create new groups in Segment using SCIM. All groups created using SCIM start with “Minimal Workspace Access.” The “Minimal Workspace Access” permission does not have access to any sources, destinations, etc. To add more permissions to a group you must use the Segment web app.
Your IdP can add or remove workspace members from existing groups using SCIM. Your IdP can also update Segment group names.
Your IdP can use SCIM to delete groups from your Segment workspace. Deleting a group in Segment doesnotremove its members from your workspace. To remove members from the workspace, unassign the users from Segment from your IdP, then Segment removes them from the workspace.
When you integrate Segment SCIM and your IdP you might need to map attributes for users. The only attributes that Segment SCIM supports areuserNameanddisplayName. You should leave any existing mapping for theemailSAML attribute, which you might have set up during your initial SSO setup. This mapping supports SAML authentication, and is separate from setting up SCIM, but may be within the same page depending on your IdP.
You’ll need to map an email (IdP) touserName(Segment). Depending on your IdP this attribute might be calledemailormail. If your IdP uses emails for usernames, you can mapuserName(IdP) touserName(Segment).
If your IdP supports thedisplayNameattribute, you can map it directly to the SegmentdisplayNameattribute. If it does not, most IdPs can create a “macro mapping” which allows you to map more than one field to a single field in Segment.
For example, you might map{firstName} {lastName}from your IdP todisplayNamein Segment. If your IdP doesn’t support this, you can mapfirstName(IdP) todisplayName(Segment).
Generate an API key, then copy and paste this value into theAPI Tokenfield in Okta, and clickSave.

Click theAssignmentstab. You can now assign people or groups. Before you continue, read through thefeatures sectionin this doc to make sure you understand how groups work. Segment recommends that you assign users to the Segment app by Okta group. This allows you to manage which groups in your organization can authenticate to Segment. You can also assign users individually.

Once you assign your users, push the assigned Okta groups to Segment.

Tip: You can also link Okta groups to an existing group from in the Segment app using the Okta UI.

Paragraphs:
MFA is available to all Segment plans, but cannot be used with SSO.See theavailable plans, orcontact Support.
On this page
Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) provides an additional layer of security when logging into your Segment account. When MFA is enabled, users must enter their username and password, and a one-time use code. Users can either enable MFA for their own account, or workspace owners can require that all users in a workspace use MFA. These security settings are available in the workspace from the “Advanced Settings” section.
You can configure your Segment workspace to send a text message code (U.S. and Canada only), or use an authentication app to generate a time-based token (for exampleGoogle Authenticator,1Password, orAuthy). You can also log in using a recovery code in case you don’t have your MFA device available. When you configure MFA, be sure to save your recovery code in safe place so you can access your Segment account in the event you lose your MFA device.
We highly recommend that youchoose a strong passwordand also enable MFA for the email account that you use to log into Segment. If someone is able to gain access to your email, they will be able to access your Segment account even if your Segment account has MFA enabled.
MFA is available to all Segment customers that are notlogged in using SSO. If your company uses SSO to sign in to Segment, you should enable MFA at the SSO provider. Contact your company’s IT team if you have questions about your company’s SSO configuration.
Once MFA is enabled, Segment prompts you for one of these methods every time you log in.
Your recovery code can be used bypass in the event you do not have your MFA device. If you no longer have access to your recovery code, you can choose to send a recovery code to your email to re-access your Account.

Segment’s dbt extension lets you useReverse ETLwith your existing dbt labs models and syncs to help centralize model management and versioning, reduce redundancies, and run CI checks to prevent breaking changes.
With Segment’s dbt extension, you can:
This page explains how to set up a dbt Model and then use the model with Reverse ETL.
Keep the following in mind as you set up the dbt extension:
To set up the dbt extension, you’ll need:
Follow these steps to connect the Git repository that stores your dbt Models:
After you’ve saved your setup, you can configure your Git repository’s settings to your needs by changing the repository, branch, dbt version, default schema, and project path.
You can also use dbt Cloud to schedule Reverse ETL syncs after a dbt Cloud job successfully runs.
To set up dbt Cloud:
Adding a custom subdomain
By default, dbt sets the subdomain to cloud. To identify your custom subdomain, open your URL and copy the portion before.getdbt.com. For example, if your domain washttps://subdomain.getdbt.com/, your subdomain would besubdomain.
The dbt Cloud integration allows you to schedule Reverse ETL syncs based on a dbt Cloud job.  When a dbt Cloud job is selected under the Reverse ETL scheduling section, Segment creates a webhook in the dbt Cloud account that will initiate to run the Reverse ETL sync when the job is scheduled.
In order to create the webhook, ensure that you have webhook permissions associated with the dbt Cloud token in the previous step.
After you set up dbt, Segment runs an initial sync to load models from your connected Git repository. This initial sync lets you use the most recent models when you set up Reverse ETL. In addition to Segment’s initial dbt sync, you can also trigger manual dbt model syncs.
After you’ve successfully set up dbt with a warehouse and connected to your Git repository, you can select dbt models for use with Reverse ETL by following these steps:
To change a connected model, ensure that you’ve removed it from all active Reverse ETL syncs.
Git Connections enable Segment to sync data with your preferred Git repository through supported like SSH and token-based authentication.
Git Sync and the dbt integration operate independently. You don’t need to set up Git Sync to use dbt, and dbt Cloud can trigger its own syncs without relying on Git Sync.
Segment supports the following credential types for setting up a Git Connection:
Segment lets you set up multiple Git Connections, allowing you to reuse credentials across both dbt and Git Sync. You can either use the same credential for multiple configurations or create separate Git Connections for each product and environment as needed.
If you plan to reuse a Git token across both dbt and Git Sync, ensure it has the necessary read and write permissions for both integrations.
CI check availability
CI checks are available only with the GitHub App connection.
CI checks in Segment help prevent breaking changes to active dbt models. Avoid changing dbt models currently in use with an active Reverse ETL sync, since changes could disrupt existing mappings and active syncs.
When CI checks are enabled, Segment monitors model changes in your Git repository. If a model already linked to an active Reverse ETL sync gets modified, Segment automatically rejects the change to maintain data integrity.
To enable CI Checks, authorize a GitHub App credential for your Git connection. Once connected, you can enable CI Checks in the dbt model sync configuration section.
The following table lists common dbt Extension errors, as well as their solutions:

Segment’s Git extension lets you manage versioning by syncing changes you make in your Segment workspace to a Git repository.
Git Sync supports one-way synchronization from Segment to Git. This sync captures the current state of your workspace through a full sync and includes all new records and changes for supported resources.
Segment doesn’t support syncing changes from Git back to Segment.
Follow these steps to set up Git Sync:
The Git sync extension syncs the following resources from Segment to your Git repository:
The Git sync extension doesn’t support the following resources:
Reach out toSegment supportto request support for additional Git Sync resources.
After you set up the Git sync extension for the first time, Segment performs an initial sync that sends the current state of your Segment workspace to the Git repository you connected. Segment automatically tracks all following workspace updates.
You can manually trigger syncs at any time by clickingFull Syncon the Git Sync page. To disable Git Sync from the Git Sync page, switch theEnabledtoggle to off.
Because a Segment workspace can represent a distinct environment (testing, staging, production), each workspace is mapped directly to a single Git repository. This direct mapping ensures a clear and organized relationship between workspace resources and a Git repository.
Segment uses itsTerraform providerto manage key functions like tracking changes and retrieving information about those changes in Segment. Segment stores changes in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), the format used by Terraform. To learn more about HCL and how it compares to JSON or YAML, visitHashiCorp’s HCL repository on GitHub.
Using HCL makes it easier to document Segment’s data model, especially for users managing versioning and Git Sync with Terraform. It also helps manage Segment configurations directly from Git. For more details on the Git Sync data model, readSegment’s Terraform provider documentation.
Segment supports one-way synchronization from Segment to Git, but you can set up two-way synchronization using the Segment Terraform provider.
Terraform offers an open-source way to manage Segment resources through a Git repository as an alternative to a fully managed two-way sync. This method requires third-party tools likeAtlantisfor CI integration.
To manage Segment resources using Git and Terraform, follow these steps:
Include the following provider configuration blocks:
For more information on using Terraform, visitTerraform’s documentation.
Git Connections enable Segment to sync data with your preferred Git repository through supported like SSH and token-based authentication.
Git Sync and the dbt integration operate independently. You don’t need to set up Git Sync to use dbt, and dbt Cloud can trigger its own syncs without relying on Git Sync.
Segment supports the following credential types for setting up a Git Connection:
Segment lets you set up multiple Git Connections, allowing you to reuse credentials across both dbt and Git Sync. You can either use the same credential for multiple configurations or create separate Git Connections for each product and environment as needed.
If you plan to reuse a Git token across both dbt and Git Sync, ensure it has the necessary read and write permissions for both integrations.
When setting up Git Sync, you may run into an access error with the following message:“Unable to create Git Sync due to Git connection issues. Please check your configuration and try again.
This error can occur if there are issues with your Git connection settings or permissions. To resolve the error, verify that:

Paragraphs:
Picking a strong password is one of the most important things you can do to protect your account.
Twilio Unified Login users can manage their password in their Twilio account
Twilio Unified Login users can manage their user settings, including name, email, password, and 2FA settings, directly in their Twilio account. To learn more about Twilio’s user and password policies, review Twilio’sAccount Managementdocumentation.
When you first create a Segment account, or when you reset or change the password of an existing account, you’ll see some tools which Segment uses to help you choose a strong password. Segment useszxcvbnto show your password strength, andHave I Been Pwnedto notify you if your password has been found in any data breaches. Your password is never stored in plaintext, and is securely stored using thebcryptpassword hashing function in Segment’s database.
Here are some general password guidelines:
Use a password manager like1PasswordorLastPassto generate and store passwords.
Passwords should be 8 or more characters. Consider using pass-phrases (for example,customer data infrastructure), combinations of random characters (for example,9;ske%t!u9jdckd#s>), or other strategies that are difficult to guess, such asicOnsTent CaPitaliZation.
Use a different password for every website. If you use the same password on multiple websites and one is breached, your accounts on all of these websites may be affected.
Do not share your password with anyone, even your co-workers. Once shared, they may use that password on another site or share it with another co-worker without telling you. If one of them leaves the company they will still be able to take actions under your account.
If you see a message that says “This password is known to have been previously compromised in a data breach”, it means that the password you typed has been used before, and was in a database that was compromised and put on the internet. This doesnotmean that Segment has been compromised, or that someone has accessed your Segment account. Check outHave I Been Pwnedfor more information, and choose a different password.

We bill per workspace, and on our Team or Business plans you can create as many sources as you need. Each Segment source will have its own Write Key, so you can easily keep things separate.
For each source, you also get to choose which integrations you want it to send data to.

Paragraphs:
Before you can use your Segment account, you first need to verify your email address. We automatically send a verification message to the address you used to sign, but you can re-send the verification email if you didn’t receive it.
If a team member invited you to a Segment workspace, your email is automatically verified if you set up your account from the link in the invitation email.

You should receive a verification email from Segment within 20 minutes of signing up for a Segment account.
If you don’t receive the verification email, check out some of the suggestions below:
Typos: Check the spelling of your email address. If the spelling is incorrect, sign up again using the correct spelling of the address.
Spam or Junk Folder: Check your Spam or Junk folder. Verification emails may be filtered directly into your email provider’s spam or junk mail folder. Your ISP or corporate domain may be configured to deliver commercial mail to this folder by default.
Web Browser Needs a Refresh: Try requesting another verification email, and refresh the page of your email web browser.
Blocked or Bounced Address: If you tried to verify a specific email address but did not receive the verification email, your ISP or corporate domain may have blocked the email. If you haven’t receivedanySegment emails, try verifying an alternative email address or get help.
Role, Group, or Alias Address: Some role addresses can be verified, but many can’t, because more than one person may have access to a role email address (such asadminordev-opsemails). You should use a personal email address for your contact and billing address.

Paragraphs:
The Public API is available to customers on Team or Business plans.See theavailable plans, orcontact Support.
On this page
The Segment Public API helps you manage your Segment workspaces and its resources. You can use the API to perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations at no extra charge. This includes working with resources such as Sources, Destinations, Warehouses, Tracking Plans, and the Segment Destinations and Sources Catalogs. The Public API is available to Team and Business Tier customers.
All CRUD endpoints in the API follow REST conventions and use standard HTTP methods. Different URL endpoints represent different resources in a workspace.
Research and test the Public API's available endpoints.
If your application is built in Javascript / Typescript, Go, Java, or Swift, check outSegment’s Public API SDKs.
The Public API includes the following benefits over the Config API:
Only Workspace Owners can create a Public API token
Only users with the Workspace Owner role can create a Public API token. For more information about roles, see Segment’sRolesdocumentation.
To create a Public API token in your Segment workspace:
To begin sending requests to the Public API, make sure to include the Public API Token into your HTTP requests with theAuthorizationHeader and configured withBearer Tokenand the value of the newly generated Public API token.
To enhance API token security, Segment partners with GitHub to prevent fraudulent use of exposed API tokens found in public git repositories. This helps to prevent malicious actors from using exposed tokens to perform unauthorized actions in your Segment workspace.
Within seconds, GitHub scans each commit in public repositories for Public API tokens, and sends detected tokens to Segment. Valid tokens are automatically revoked and workspace owners are notified.
Learn more aboutGitHub’s secret scanning program.
In most cases, identifying and revoking an exposed token takes seconds. Segment recommends you check theaudit trailto ensure no unauthorized actions were taken with the token.
Developers can accidentally commit tokens to public repositories, exposing them to the public. This can happen when developers use a token in a local development environment and forget to remove it before committing their code.
By automatically revoking the exposed token, Segment helps keep your workspace secure and prevents potential abuse of the token.
This feature is automatically enabled for all workspaces on Team or Business tier plans.
If you see a CORS error, this means you’re attempting to make a request to the Public API on the front-end. The Public API is used for server-side only. To get rid of the error, move all Public API requests to a server.
Onlyusers that have aWorkspace Ownerrolecan create Public API Tokens.
When you don’t have a source to forward violations or blocked events to, then exclude the fieldsforwardingViolationsToorforwardingBlockedEventsToentirely from the request and the setting will be disabled.
PATCHendpoint :https://api.segmentapis.com/sources/{sourceId}/settings
The destination’s Instance ID is specific to a single destination within your workspace. The destination’s Meta ID, which is returned by the delivery metrics endpoint, identifies which integration you’ve set up. For example, if you had adevMixpanel (Actions) destination and aprodMixpanel (Actions) destination, they would have the same Meta ID but two different Instance IDs.

The Segment Public API is available
Segment’sPublic APIis available for Team and Business tier customers to use. You can use the Public API and Config APIs in parallel, but moving forward any API updates will come to the Public API exclusively.
Please contact your account team orfriends@segment.comwith any questions.
This reference provides a comprehensive overview of the Segment Destination Filter query language. For information on the Destination Filters API (including information on migrating from the Config API), visit theDestination Filters API reference.
TheTransformations APIuses Filter Query Language (FQL) to filter JSON objects and conditionally apply transformations. You can use FQL statements to:
In addition to boolean and equality operators likeandand>=, FQL has built-in functions that make it more powerful such ascontains( str, substr )andmatch( str, pattern ).
Given the following JSON object:
The following FQL statements will evaluate as follows:
FQL statements may refer to any field in the JSON object including top-level
properties likeuserIdoreventas well as nested properties likecontext.library.versionorproperties.titleusing dot-separated paths. For
example, the following fields can be pointed to by the associated field paths:
If your field name has a character not in the set of{a-z A-Z 0-9 _ -}, you must escape it using a\character. For example, the nested field below can be referred to byproperties.product\ 1.price:
You can use parentheses to group subexpressions for more complex “and / or” logic as long as the subexpression evaluates to true or false:
Functions handlenullwith sensible defaults to make writing FQL more concise.
For example, you can writelength( userId ) > 0instead oftypeof( userId ) =
'string' and length( userId ) > 0.
Thematch( string, pattern )function uses “glob” matching to returntrueif the given string fully matches a given pattern. Glob patterns are case sensitive. If you only need to determine if a string contains another string, you should usecontains().
If your FQL statement is invalid (for exampleuserId = oops"), your Segment event will not be sent on to downstream Destinations. Segment defaults to not sending the event to ensure that invalid FQL doesn’t cause sensitive information like PII to be incorrectly sent to Destinations.
For this reason, Segment recommends that you use the Destination Filters “Preview” API to test your filters without impacting your production data.

Segment’s query language lets you define audience segments and computed traits. With clear syntax and practical functionality, the language simplifies the process of defining conditions and computations, helping you extract valuable insights from customer data.
This reference provides a comprehensive overview of the Segment query language.
Segment's query language in private beta
Segment’s query language is in private beta, and Segment is actively working on this feature. Some functionality may change before it becomes generally available.
Audience definitions specify the criteria for identifying users or accounts as members of a particular audience, while computed trait definitions outline the logic for aggregating or calculating values stored as traits on user or account level profiles.
With Segment’s query language, you can create these definitions and use them with Segment APIs to generate audiences and computed traits.
This section outlines the functions and operators you can use with the query language.
Follow these syntax rules when you create definitions:
The language supports the following syntactic sugar adjustments:
The definition type (USERSorACCOUNTS) determines whether the computation operates at the user or account level. For account-level audiences, you can apply additional functionsANY(to verify that all underlying users meet the defined conditions) andALL(to check if any of the underlying users meet the defined conditions).
These functions use the association between accounts and users to determine audience membership.
The following tables list the query languages’s available functions.
Suppose you wanted to collect all users who performed theShoes Boughtevent at least once within the last seven days, where the purchase price was greater than or equal to 100.
Another way to think of this scenario would be:
Here’s how you could do that in Segment’s query language:
This example collects:
This example collects all users who did not perform theShoes Boughtevent at least once and don’t have atotal_spendtrait with a value greater than200:
This example collects all accounts where all associated users performed theShoes Boughtevent at least once and have atotal_spendtrait greater than200:
This example collects all accounts where no associated users performed theShoes Boughtevent at least once:
This example collects all accounts where any associated users performed theShoes Boughtevent at least once:
Suppose you wanted to calculate the average spend based on allShoes Boughtevents performed within the last 30 days for each user.
Another way to think of this would be:
Here’s how you could do that in Segment’s query language:
This example calculates the minimum spend for each user, based on allShoes Boughtevents, where the price was greater than100and the brand wasMy_Brand:
This example calculates the first-seen spend value for each user, based on allShoes Boughtevents performed within the last 30 days:
This example calculates the most frequent spend value for each user, based on allShoes Boughtevents performed within the last 30 days. It only considers spend values that have a minimum frequency of2:

Please contact your account team orfriends@segment.comwith any questions.
The Config API enables you to programmatically manage Segment workspaces, sources, destinations and more. With the API you can:
The Config API is a set of REST services under segmentapis.com:
To see all the API methods and models see theSegment Config API Reference.
At this time there are no language-specific clients. However theAPI Referencealso contains example code snippets for cURL, Go, Node, Python and more.
You can interact with the API from the command line. First install thecurltool.
You can use the Config API with an access token to programmatically access Segment resources that the token can access. Access tokens are created by workspace owners using the Access Management page, and can only access resources that the token has permission to.
These are currently only suitable for first party, trusted applications, such as your personal local scripts and server side programs. Partners should not prompt Segment users for their username and password and save an access token as a way to delegate access. See theAuthenticationdoc for more information.
When you create an access token, you’ll give it a description, a workspace, and determine whether it has workspace owner or member access.
Secret Token
You can not retrieve the plain-texttokenlater, so you should save it in a secret manager. If you lose thetokenyou can generate a new one.
info
As of February 1, 2024, new Config API tokens cannot be created in the app as Segment moves toward exclusive support for thePublic API.Migrate your implementation to the Public APIto access the latest features and available endpoints. To create a new Config API token, reach out to friends@segment.com for support.
Now that you have an access token, you can use this token to access the rest of the Config API by setting it in theAuthorizationheader of your requests, for example:

The Segment Public API is available
Segment’sPublic APIis available for Team and Business tier customers to use. You can use the Public API and Config APIs in parallel, but moving forward any API updates will come to the Public API exclusively.
Please contact your account team orfriends@segment.comwith any questions.
Segment strives to maintain a strict contract around the stability of our APIs once they reach maturity.
The Config API is versioned statically by path prefix. The current version,/v1beta, is stable and suitable for production use, but not 100% mature. We will not ship any backwards incompatible breaking changes after its public launch on December 12, 2018. However, we may release new versions of the API as further/v1betaXreleases or as major version releases (such as/v1).
The reason the path is currently/v1betais to signify both that Segment’s product model is evolving and that we are looking for feedback from developers on how best to expose that model for public consumption, extension, and automation.
Therefore,/v1betais subject to deprecation with 3 months of written notice after the release of/v1, should we decide to land any breaking changes in the final/v1release.
We’re always actively seeking feedback on the ergonomics and breadth of our APIs. If you have ideas of how we can improve them that you’d like to see as extensions to/v1betaor considered for changes in/v1, don’t hesitate toget in touch.
The Config API is a set of REST APIs for managing Segment resources. The primary Segment resources are:
You can manage each resource using standard methods:
The List method is paginated. Requests take an optionalpage_sizeparameter which generally defaults to 10 or 100 items. If there are more thanpage_sizeitems in a collection, the response includes anext_page_tokenfield. You can then supply this aspage_tokenparameter to the next List request. If there are no more items in the collection,next_page_tokenwill be empty.
Update methods follow PATCH semantics. In addition to the data to update, the method requires an explicit set of field names to update. This removes all ambiguity around empty values.
Note that specifying an update path with no value will change the field to an empty value (e.g. “”, 0, or false). For example this will result inenabledfalse:
And note that specifying data but no paths will not change the field value. For example this has no effect:
Resources are named entities exposed by our services and APIs, and resource names are their identifiers. Each resource has its own unique resource name made up of the ID or slug of the resource itself and the IDs or slugs of any parent resources.
So a given Source resource might look like:
workspaces/<customer-workspace-slug>/sources/<customer-source-slug>
Segment APIs use scheme-less URIs for resource names. This allows us to generally follow REST URL conventions and provides a machine and human-legible standard for our identifiers.
Segment favors “slugs” over opaque IDs when the resource is customer- or Segment-named and unlikely to change, such as sources and destinations. For resources whose name is subject to change frequently, such as Tracking Plans, we will autogenerate prefixed IDs for you upon creation and use that in the fully qualified resource name.
While full resource names resemble normal URLs, they are not the same thing. A single resource may be exposed by different API versions, API protocols, or API network endpoints as Segment’s APIs evolve.

Segment’sPublic APIis available for Team and Business tier customers to use. You can use the Public API and Config APIs in parallel, but moving forward any API updates will come to the Public API exclusively.
Please contact your account team orfriends@segment.comwith any questions.
You can access the Config API programmatically using access tokens. When you authenticate with an access token, you have access to any resource and permission assigned to the token.
As a workspace owner, you can create access tokens from the Access Management page in Admin settings. You can assign the same granularity of permissions as you can for a logged-in user. As best practice, tokens should be assigned the least permissions needed to perform a required API action. All tokens must have a description.
Secret Token

Welcome! Here are the steps you’ll follow to build an integration on Dev Center 2.0, launch your destination to Private Beta so customers can test it, and then launch it as Public in the Segment catalog.
Over 19,000 companies use Segment as their central hub for collecting and synthesizing first-party customer data. Customers use Segmentsourcesto collect data across all their properties (for example, web, mobile, CRMs, or email) and send this data intodestinations(SaaS tools, internal databases or queues, or a data warehouse) to perform analytics, run marketing campaigns and much more.
Segment provides two different integration types to support bringing your data into Segment, and sending your data downstream to other third-party tools.
Sourcesbring users’ first-party data into Segment. While there are severaltypesof sources (for example, web or server libraries, mobile integrations, and Cloud), the Developer Center enables you to build your ownCloud Eventsources. These sources enable users to import data directly from your application into Segment.
Destinationssend data to other tools for processing or analysis. For example, a Segment user may want to send their data to your advertising platform or analytics tool. To accomplish this, they’ll connect your Segment destination to their workspace.
All new Segment Destinations are built on theActions framework, which enables a simplified build experience for you and a more straightforward configuration experience for your users.
To develop your integration in the Developer Center, complete the following steps:
Sign up for theSegment Select Partner Program. During the sign-up process, you’ll agree to theSegment Partner Program AgreementandPrivacy Policy.
Segment’sConceptual Modelis a high-level overview of how Segment works and explains how your integration fits into the Segment catalog.
TheSegment Specprovides best practices for the specific data you should capture and the best way to format that data based on your use case. The Spec outlines the semantic definition of the customer data that Segment captures across all its libraries and APIs, and will be a main building block for your integration.
Security for both customers and partners is a priority at Segment. Before you start building on the Developer Center, review theAcceptable Use Policyand ensure you’re following these guidelines:
Segment provides access to the Developer Portal on request. Open the Developer Portal page and clickSign upto request access. A Segment account is required for this step.
Segment receives a large volume of requests so please include a valid company website and email address, answer all questions with details about integration’s use case as well as highlighting specific customer requests to expedite the approval process.
Follow the steps to build yoursourceordestination.
Documentation is integral to enabling Segment’s users to self-serve and onboard with your integration. Segment’s documentation team will work with you during this part of the process to ensure your documentation matches the Segment style and is as instructive as possible.
Before users can go hands on with your integration, a review by Segment engineers is required to ensure the integration meets security and usability standards.
To submit your destination for review, follow the destination-specific instructions in theSubmit a pull requestdocs.
To submit your source for review, complete the steps described in the Developer Portal and clickSubmit for review.

Paragraphs:

The Segment Javascript library wrapper, which makes it simple to send your data to any tool without having to learn, test or implement the new API for each tool every time.
Application Programming Interface. In software, this term describes a way of interacting with software in an automated fashion, without the use of a user-interface designed for humans. In Segment, we call the standard calls (track,pageandscreen,identifyandgroup) our API. We also provide thePublic API, which you can use to configure sources and destinations, and perform other functions in your workspace, without logging in using a web browser.
The app is what we call the main Segment web application, the part you log in to, and where you configure sources and destinations, see events in the debugger, manage your tracking plan, and so on.
Asynchronous means occurring without a specific order or sequence. In engineering, it’s most often used for things like when you have to ask a server for a piece of information. If that was a synchronous task, while you were waiting for the server to respond you wouldn’t be able to do anything else, you’d just be stuck waiting. But since it’s asynchronous, you can request information from a server, continue to go do a bunch of other tasks, and then when the server responds you can get back to what you were doing to start. Basically it lets you work on multiple things at once (in parallel) instead of needing to finish everything in the order it comes in. Think of it like one of the ways computers are able to multi-task.
Personas Audiencesallow you to define cohorts of users or accounts based on their event behavior and traits that Segment then keeps up-to-date over time. Audiences can be built from your core tracking events, traits, or computed traits. These audiences can then be synced to hundreds of destinations or available using the Profile API.
Amazon Web Services, a large cloud service provider.
Segment’s list of available sources, destinations, and warehouses. You can access the catalog from theSegment website, and from inside the Segment app.
Content Delivery Network. CDNs are a network of servers which make downloading files faster for the user, by placing them all around the world to reduce data transit time. When you have servers in a CDN, they’re much closer on average to the end user. If someone is using Segment in Asia, they don’t have to download our files all the way from California, they can get them from a server much closer to them in the network.
Customer Data Platform: a central platform that brokers the flow of customer data through their application infrastructure so that they can build a central understanding of each customer’s interactions, comply with regulations that require them to carefully manage customer data, and ensure that their interactions with the customer are optimized.
Cookies are small pieces of text that are stored by the browser on a website. Cookies have anameand avalue. They may also be set from Javascript usingdocument.cookie. Our analytics.js script sets up a cookie calledajs_uidto store the user’s id.
Every time you make a request to a website, you send along the cookies that you have stored. It’s how the website figures out who you should be logged in as. You can think of it sort of like a passport as a form of ID. When you first enter your username and password, the website generates a secure cookie, and tells your browser to store it. From then on, your browser sends along the cookie as a way of identifying yourself to the website.
This refers to a group of libraries that can send data to Segment and which sendDevice-modedata. The term “client side” is usually used in contrast toServer Side.
Cloud mode, (orServer-side) libraries send data to Segment, where it’s then sent on to destinations. Usually used in contrast toDevice modelibraries, which send the data directly to the destination’s API endpoints.
Cloud mode librariesrun on a server and are completely invisible to end users. You can find the full list of server-side languages Segment supportsin the Sources catalog. These libraries can be used to track a user in realtime as they use your app, but are also able to run batches of calls to update many end users at once. Cloud-mode libraries do not maintain “state” which means every API call you make must include every detail you want to see inside of Segment.
Computed traitsare per-user or per-accounttraitsthat you create or “compute” in Segment. When you build a computed trait, Segment adds it to relevant user profiles.
Custom traitsare user or account traits collected from the Identify calls you send to Segment.  For example, you can add any trait that you send as a part of your Identify calls (email,first_name,last_name) as custom traits. You can then view them in the Profile explorer, and use them in your audiences, computed traits, and SQL traits.
This is the place in the app where you can see your events flowing through Segment.
A destination is a target for Segment to forward data to, and represents a tool or storage destination.
Device mode, (orclient-side) libraries are loaded on the on the user’s client (for example their web browser, or mobile device), which means they can collect contextual data about the user. The three main libraries that are considered “device mode” areAnalytics.js, which is used on websites, ouriOS SDK, and ourAndroid SDK. Device mode libraries can maintain a cache of information about each user on the device so we know that device belongs to a consistentanonymousIdoruserId, and has a consistent list of traits like name, email, etc.
Data management platform
Demand-side platform
Extract, Transform and Load. Referring to the process of extracting data from a production system, transforming it with enriching data into a new format, and then loading it into a data warehouse for analysis (a separate database from production).
An event can refer to either an action by a user, or something a user does which triggers atrack call. Events have a name (for example “Product viewed”) and properties (for example the product name, price, and category), and take place in a single moment in time. (This is in contrast to “objects” which persist over a period of time, and which have properties that might change.)
A call that gathers information about who the user is.
JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a convenient format for storing structured data.
A library is a reusable piece of code which acts as a building block for higher level pieces of code. It’s the software equivalent of a ‘tool’. For instance, take Instagram filters. In the good old days, to take a picture with an interesting filter, you had to adjust the aperture length, the focal length, the exposure and film speed to get the desired effect. But now, you can just use Instagram, and press a button to get the pre-tuned filter that you want. They’ve packaged those effects in software and made them re-usable.
The most common use case for this term at Segment is in reference to the libraries people use to send data to our API.A full list of libraries can be found in our docs. Libraries can collect either in “Device mode” or “Cloud mode”.
A “lookback window” limits the period of time in which data is considered when calculating a trait or audience. For example, you might set a lookback window of 7 days on an audience or trait likenew_users_7_days, but you would not add a lookback window to a trait that isn’t time-bounded, such aslifetime_value.
A method is programming speak for “an action an object can take”. It’s a specific type of function that is attached to an object. All of our analytics tracking libraries createanalyticsobjects, and thentrack,identify,page,etcare methods you can invoke on those objects.
Monthly Tracked Users. You can find more about how they are calculatedherebut in short, they are calculated by adding the number unique userIds and number of unique anonymousIds that a customer tracks with Segment.
An object is a type of data that persists over time and can be updated, for example a Business or a User record. Objects have “traits” which record information about that object, and which can change over time. For example a “user” object could have a trait of “email” which doesn’t change often, but could also have acomputed traitlikelogged_in_last_7_days. (Objects are in contrast to “events” which happen at a single moment in time, and whose properties do not change.)
Over the top (OTT) refers to content providers that distribute streaming media as a standalone product directly to viewers over the Internet, bypassing telecommunications, multichannel television, and broadcast television platforms that traditionally act as a controller or distributor of such content.
The Segment API call records that a user “viewed a page”. It’s recorded by callinganalytics.page(). You can optionally pass in anameand acategory.
An open-sourceSQLserver.
An analytics data warehouse from Amazon Web Services. Made for loading in tons of event data, and then analyzing it with complex queries. It’s designed to be fast and cheap.
How often we attempt to redeliver a payload before marking it as failed.
The ability to re-send your user data to new destinations and tools.
A schema is a word used to refer to the design of a database, including what fields there are, and what data types each one contains. If you were to think of a database as a spreadsheet, the schema would be the top row with the field labels, plus the data types and formatting rules for each column.
In Segment, you can send data to a Warehouse which has a schema based on the types of data you collect and route through Segment, and which updates as the data you collect changes.
Refers to a group of libraries that can send data to Segment, inCloud mode, meaning through the Segment cloud. “Server side” can could refer to people sending data directly toour HTTP APIwithout using a “library”. Usually used in contrast toClient Side.
Software Development Kit. This is a combination of libraries and used mostly in the context of building mobile or native apps.
(pronounced ‘sequel’)
Structured Query Language. The standard language for retrieving information from a database. It’s often called “relational” because all the queries are related to relations between the data. For instance, find me all users who are named “Alice” would translate to…
SQL traitsare per-user or per-account traits that you create by running queries against your data warehouse, which can include data not captured using your Segment implementation. Segment imports the results into Personas, and appends these traits to the user profile.
A website, server library, mobile SDK, or cloud application which can send data into Segment.
Short for “Specification”, the Segment Spec is our set of recommendations for what data to collect and how to format it.
Supply-side Platform
The number of API calls and Objects your account makes, per MTU. The limit on this number is defined by your account plan.
Type of API call (method) which records any actions that users perform on a web or mobile app.
A tracking plan is a tool that our customers use to keep track of their analytics setup. It contains all of the events, pages, traits and properties they want to record with information about how each is laid out. It’s often in a spreadsheet or document, but we’re actually building the functionality into the core product so that people can plan out their tracking setup right from inside Segment.
Traits are individual pieces of information that we know about anobject. Objects persist over time, so traits can change over time.
Segment’s Data warehouse product. All event data can be sent to one of several Warehouses, where your team can use it to perform more complex analysis of the data.

Paragraphs:
On this page
The Group API call is how you associate an individual user with a group, such as a company, organization, account, project, or team.
The Group call enables you to identify what account or organization your users are part of. There are two IDs that are relevant in a Group call: theuserId, which belongs and refers to the user, and thegroupId, which belongs and refers to the specific group. A user can be in more than one group which would mean differentgroupIds, but the user will only have oneuserIdthat is associated to each of the different groups. Keep in mind that not all platforms support multiple groups for a single user.
Check out our high-level overview of these APIs in Segment University. (Must be logged in to access.)
In addition to thegroupId, which is how you’d identify the specific group or company, the group method receives traits that are specific to the group, like industry or number of employees for example, that belong to that specific account. Like the traits of an identify call, you can update these when you call the same trait with a different value.
When using the Group call, it’s helpful if you have accounts with multiple users.
Segment doesn't have an ungroup call
If you’re using a device-mode destination that has a method for ungrouping users, you can invoke it directly on the client sideusing Segment’s ready() method.
For cloud-mode destinations, you cancreate a Destination Functionto ungroup users.
Here’s the payload of a typical Group call, with mostcommon fieldsremoved:
And here’s the corresponding JavaScript event that would generate the above payload:
Based on the library you use, the syntax in the examples might be different. You can find library-specific documentation on theSources Overviewpage.
Beyond the common fields, the Group call takes the following fields:
Here’s a complete example of a Group call:
Use the following interactive code pen to see what your Group calls would look like with user-provided information:
The User ID is a unique identifier for the user performing the actions. Check out theUser ID docsfor more detail.
The Anonymous ID can be any pseudo-unique identifier, for cases where you don’t know who the user is, but you still want to tie them to an event. Check out theAnonymous ID docsfor more detail.
Note: In our browser and mobile libraries a User ID is automatically addedfrom the state stored by a previousidentifycall, so you do not need to add it yourself. They will also automatically handle Anonymous IDs under the covers.
A Group ID is the unique identifier which you recognize a group by in your own database. For example, if you’re using MongoDB it might look something like507f191e810c19729de860ea.
Traits are pieces of information you know about a group that are passed along with the Group call, likeemployeesorwebsite.
Segment has reserved some traits that have semantic meanings for groups, and handles them in special ways. You shouldonly use reserved traits for their intended meaning.
The following are the reserved traits Segment has standardized:
Note:You might be used to some destinations recognizing special properties differently. For example, Mixpanel has a specialtrack_chargesmethod for accepting revenue. Luckily, you don’t have to worry about those inconsistencies. Just pass alongrevenue.Segment handles all of the destination-specific conversions for you automatically.Same goes for the rest of the reserved properties.
If you pass these values,on nullwill throw aNullPointerException.
You may continue to set values inside the trait.  If you do so, this would work the same as the rules do with NoSQL data. If you had set a value previously for a user and on the next request you sent the same value of that property ason null, it will be replaced bynull, but if you do not send that property, the original value is persisted.
Traits are case-insensitive, so in JavaScript you can match the rest of your camel-case code by sendingcreatedAt, and in Ruby you can match your snake-case code by sendingcreated_at. That way the API never seems alien to your code base.
