The purpose of this guide is to walk you through the basic steps of setting up mParticle in your app, unlocking core functionality, and troubleshooting common issues. Along the way, you’ll cover some important concepts you need to understand to be successful with mParticle.
This is not a complete guide to all of mParticle’s features and capabilities. If you already know your way around mParticle and you’re looking for in-depth docs, head to ourDevelopersorGuidessections.
The tutorials in this guide follow the process of setting up mParticle in the mPTravel app: a mobile and web app that sells luxury travel packages to its users.
Later on in this guide, you’ll learn about sending data from mParticle to some of our many integration partners. As examples, the tutorials use services which are simple to set up and verify, and which offer a free account tier, so that you will be able follow the examples exactly if you wish. However, mParticle is agnostic about which integrations you choose and you can follow the same basic steps from this guide to implement any of our integrations.
One of the key functions of mParticle is to receive your data from wherever it originates, and send it wherever it needs to go. The sources of your data are inputs and the service or app where it is forwarded are outputs. A connection is a combination of an input and output.
Inputs include:
To get started with mParticle, you need some data, which means you need to create at least one input.
The first thing you need to do is to to create a set of access credentials that will allow a client-side SDK or a server-side application to forward data to this workspace.
mParticle labels the credentials you create for an integration the key and secret, but they are not exactly like an API key and secret, since you embed these credentials in the app. However, this is not the security risk that exposing API credentials would be:
Most anonymous client-server architectures, including Adobe, Braze, Firebase, Google Analytics, and Segment don’t have per-session or per-instance credentials, nor does mParticle.
You need a developer to help you install and initialize an SDK. See the Getting Started guides for theiOS,AndroidorJavascriptSDKs to get set up before continuing.
For the iOS, Android, tvOS, and Web platforms, some advanced configuration settings are available. To change these settings, navigate toSetup > Inputsin the left column and select either iOS, Android, tvOS, or Web from the list of platforms.
Expand theAdvanced Settingsby clicking the + icon.
iOS, Android, and tvOS (Apple TV) devices allow users to limit the collection of advertising IDs. Advertising IDs are unique identifiers you may use to associate event and user data with a specific device. For both iOS and Android devices, if a user has not provided explicit consent to share their device’s advertising ID, then the value of that ID is set to an all-zero value.
By checkingRestrict Device ID by Limit Ad Tracking, mParticle will not collect advertising IDs from users who have enabled the Limit Ad Tracking setting on their device.
Remember, mParticle will collect advertising IDs for both iOS and Android devices, regardless of whether or not a user has enabled the Limit Ad Tracking setting on their device. However, the IDs collected from users who have opted out will be all-zero values.
Following are descriptions of Apple and Google’s policies for device advertising IDs:
After the release of iOS 14.5, Apple introduced the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework, which requires app developers to request users’ explicit consent to share their advertising IDs. If a user of your app has not provided this consent, Apple’s advertising ID (IDFA) will be set to all an all-zero value:00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000. Read more about Apple advertising identifiersin their documentation.
For more information about the ATT framework, visit theiOS 14 Guide.
Google allows Android users to opt out from sharing their devices’ advertising IDs. Similar to Apple’s policy, Google will set a user’s advertising ID (GAID or AAID) to an all-zero value if that user has opted out from sharing their ID. Read more about Google’s advertising identifiers intheir documentation.
The Web SDK can collect integration-specific identifiers to enrich the user data forwarded to your connected outputs.
WhenCollect Integration-Specific Identifiersis checked, these integration-specific identifiers are collected and used to enrich your user data to help optimize the match rate of your audiences in downstream tools. Currently, these identifiers include Facebook’sfbcandfbpfields.
If you don’t see data appearing in the Live Stream within the first few minutes after opening a development build:
Congratulations, you have created a working data input. Now it’s time tostart capturing some data.

After you create an input, you can begin capturing data.
Before you start this activity, you should have already:
mParticle collects two important kinds of data:
Event data is about actions taken by a user in your app. Some events are collected automatically by mParticle’s native SDKs. These include the Session Start events you saw in the Live stream when you firstset up your input. Other events need to be captured by writing code in your app. Of these, the most significant are:
mParticle also captures data about your user, including their identities, information about the device they are using and any custom attributes you set. As with event data, some user data, such as information about the devices they use, is captured automatically by mParticle’s native SDKs. Two important types of user data must be captured by writing code in your app:
User Attributesare key-value pairs that can store any custom data about your user. The value of a user attribute can be:
To start capturing data you will need to go back to your app code. Inthe previous stepyou should have installed and initialized the mParticle SDK in at least one of your app platforms. This means you’re already set up to capture Session Start and Session End events, as well as basic data about the device. Grab a friendly developer again, if you need one, and try to add some additional user and event data to your implementation. Here are a few things you might try, with links to the appropriate developer docs:
Once you’ve added code to your app to start collecting some basic data, start up a development build of your app again and trigger some events. Have another look at the Live Stream. You should start to see new event batches, with the individual events you have added to your app.

If you have at least some data in your Live Stream, such as the session start and session end messages generated in theprevious step, but your screen views, custom events or purchases aren’t showing, it’s likely that there is an issue with your app code.
Excellent, you’ve started collecting real custom datapoints from your app. At this point you might want to take a quick break to:
Now that you’re collecting data, it’s time to send it on byconnecting an event output.

To learn more about event outputs before creating your first one, view the following video:

Before you start this activity, you should have already:
Outputs are mParticle’s term for the services where we forward your data. Outputs are also referred to as “integrations”. Outputs come in two types: “event”, and “audience”. Audiences are covered in thenext part of this guide. This section will show you how to set up an event output.
mParticle has over a hundred event outputs, and the connection process for each is similar. This tutorial creates a connection to Analytics as an example. You can follow the same steps with a different output, or create afree Analytics accountto follow along exactly.
Enter the configuration information:
Remember to save your new output configuration.
Now that you have both an input and an output set up, it’s time to connect them:
Once you have enabled the connection, open up the development build of your app again and create a few more events. Each output service displays the data it receives differently. For Analytics, you can view real-time data in theDebug Console.
If you don’t see data arriving in the output service, navigate toData Master > Live Streamand select Message Direction Outbound.
If you see messages in the outbound Live Stream, but none in the output service:
If the previous step doesn’t resolve the issue:
If there are no outgoing messages in the Live Stream, then mParticle is not attempting to send any data to the output service. Some possible reasons for this include:
By now you should be successfully forwarding data to at least one event output. Some additional resources you might want to look at include:
Next up, you will learn about the second category of mParticle data bycreating an audience.

Data Master allows you to standardize and validate customer data before it gets shared across systems, applications and teams. It encompasses the following features:

A data point is a unit of data collected by mParticle. Data points represent Events such as Custom Events or Screen Views, or User attributes such as Customer Id or Email.
Each data point includes criteria used to select the data point from an incoming data stream, and a definition called a schema that validates the contents of the data point. You can view data points in all three Data Master tools: Catalog, Live Stream, and Data Plan.
For example, here is a view of the Play Video data point in Catalog:

Here is a view of the a Commerce Event data point in Live Stream:

This view of a data point is from Data Plan:

mParticle allows you to define audiences and connect them to integrations for the purpose of engaging with your users.  This can be very powerful when it comes to user engagement and monetization scenarios.
You can define audiences from any user-associated data you capture with mParticle, whether from platform inputs or partner feeds.
When you fully instrument your app using the mParticle SDK, you send data from apps to the mParticle platform.  You can also enrich that data stream with other data sources.  For example, in addition to sending app data, you may want to send in data that is not collected in the app (server side data) and have the mParticle platform match the data based on a user identifier, and then create audiences based upon this superset of data.  Examples of data sent server side might include CRM data, purchase or revenue data from other non-mobile channels.  Make sure all the data that you need is captured is important; audience creation is the first step.
Use audiences to drive user engagement, encourage app downloads, and more.
Let’s say you want to engage with users that have recently installed your app but haven’t used your app very much.  Your objective is to drive higher engagement and convert those new users to high lifetime value users.  You want to accomplish this across multiple channels: push notification and email.  Therefore, your audience qualification criteria is that the user has installed your app in the last 72 hours and has less than three sessions.
You can easily and visually define this audience, then configure audience integrations to push notification and email partners - in this example, let’s use Button for push and Mailchimp for email.  Once you configure the respective integrations, mParticle instantiates a corresponding audience in Button and updates the corresponding email marketing list in Mailchimp.  No coding is necessary.
Let’s say you want to find more users like your currently highly engaged users and run an app download campaign in Facebook against that target audience. You start by defining your highly engaged users, using whatever criteria is important to you: lifetime value metrics, session activity, event activity, or any other data points you capture.
Once your audience is defined, configure the Facebook integration and corresponding custom audiences in your Facebook account.  From there you can leverage the custom audiences like any other custom audience in Facebook.
Because we want to target users that look like our highly engaged users, we will create a Facebook lookalike audience from our highly engaged user audience and run a Facebook app install campaign that targets that lookalike audience.
mParticle provides two types of audiences:

Rules allow you to cleanse, enrich and transform your incoming and outgoing data. A rule is a script which accepts an incoming mParticle Events API “batch” object and modifies it according to your business logic. Some example use-cases for a rule are:
Each of your Inputs, such as for your web, mobile, or server-to-server data, has an individually configured data pipeline, and each Input’s pipeline contains the same key stages. Rules are therefore applied for a specific Input’s pipeline, and it’s up to you choose where in that Input’s pipeline each Rule is executed. A single Input pipeline may contain multiple Rules each stage.
Stage 1 - Input
Data is received by mParticle for a specific Input (such as Web, iOS, or a custom server feed).
Stage 2 - Storage and Processing
The Input’s data is stored and processed by mParticle, including:
Stage 3 - Output
The Input’s data is sent individually to the mParticle Audience system and 300+ partner integrations. In this stage the pipeline actually branches out with a single Input potentially being connected to many Outputs.
Rules are applied to a specific Input’s pipeline. There are two places in the pipeline where rules can be applied:
In between Stage 1 and Stage 2
Rules executed between Stage 1 and Stage 2 affect the data sent to both Stage 2 and then Stage 3, including the mParticle profile store, audience store, and all outputs. These are labeled “All Output” Rules in your mParticle dashboard.
In between Stage 2 and Stage 3
You can also apply a rule right before it’s sent to aspecificOutput. This lets you mutate data to handle specific requirements or mappings that need to occur for a given partner integration.
Rules are executed on the server and only act on data forwarded downstream server-to-server. A warning is shown in the dashboard if you set up one of the following rules:
mParticle rules are hosted in your AWS account as Lambda functions. To do this, you need to be able to provide an Amazon Resource Number (ARN) for your rule. See theAWS Lambda documentationfor help creating a function.  The Lambda functions used for rules must be hosted in the same AWS region as yourmParticle account.
Your ARNs should look something like this:
arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:999999999999:function:mprmylambdafunction:PROD
arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:999999999999:function:mprmylambdafunction:$LATEST
To connect to your AWS Lambda function, you must provide the AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for anIAM user.
In the IAM dashboard, add the following permissions policy for the user:
You will also need to create a role in IAM. Assign this role the same policy document created above.

Assign this role to each Lambda function you plan to deploy as an mParticle rule.


Enter your Development and Production ARNs and clickTest.

When you first test a rule, you must select aFailure Action. This determines what happens if your rule throws an unhandled exception. There is no default action, you must select one of the following:
Regardless of which option you choose, it’s best practice to handle all exceptions in your code, rather than falling back on the above defaults. This is especially true if your rule deals with events, where an unhandled exception from just one event could lead to all events in the batch being dropped.
Your code must be a validLambda function.
The first time you test a rule, you are asked to provide a name, description and failure action. After naming a rule, you can test it by using one of the sample templates provided in the Test rule dialog. You can also copy and paste batch JSON from your Live Stream. If you do this, be sure to pick a full batch to copy, not a single event.  ClickTestto run. Optionally, check a box to save your JSON template in local storage for future testing.
You must enter validbatchJSON in the code editor.
If there are any syntactical errors in your code, warning or error icons will display next to the line number with details of the problem so you can correct.
After clickingTest, you can examine the JSON output from your function to see that the input has been modified as expected.
After a successful test you can clickSaveto save the Rule. Due to recent updates in AWS Lambda, it may be necessary to wait one minute after a successful test in order to save the Rule.
If your test fails, try examining thelogsfor any console output.
When you first create a rule, by default it will only be applied toDEVdata. As well as testing a rule with sample JSON you should test the rule in your dev environment to make sure data reaching your output services is as expected. When you are ready to apply a rule to your production data, clickPromote to Prodon the rule page. This will create a “v1” production rule.
Note that before a rule can be promoted to Prod, you must remove allconsole.log()statements.
If you need to make changes, choose$LATESTfrom theVersiondropdown. All other versions are read only. Test your changes with your dev environment and, when you are ready, clickPromote to Prodto create “v2” of your production rule.
Note that you can have a maximum of 50 versions per rule. If you have too many versions, select a version and click the trash can icon to the right of the version number to delete it.
Each rule has a master switch in the Settings panel. If there is a problem with your rule, you can switch it off and it will be disabled for all connections until you enable it again. To disable, clickEditin the right sidebar and set theStatusslider toinactive.
The following metrics are available:
These metrics are for the last 24 hours and apply to all connections. Summaries for each rule can be seen on the main rules page. Detailed graph of the previous 24 hours is available on theMonitoringtab of the individual rule page.

To help you with troubleshooting rules, mParticle maintains logs for each rule where you can view all console output. From an individual rule page, select theLogstab. You can filter messages by date range or search for keywords.

From the rules listing, select theDeleteaction to delete the rule. If the rule is applied to any connections, it will be removed from those connections.

The Activity section of the mParticle platform allows you to view information about your event data.
The following video provides an overview of the Activity dashboard:

The Activity Overview tracks basic stats for your workspace:

All metrics can be filtered by date range, environment and input.

Displays summary metrics for identity data collected about your users:
This section is filterable by the date range, environment and input options at the top of the page.

Displays summary information representing the current workspace’s usage, showing the following metrics:
Inputs
Outputs
The User Activity view allows you to see a detailed summary of data associated with a single user. Note that only users with the Admin or Support roles can access the User Activity view.
To find a user, begin entering any known ID for the user, an email address, customer ID, device ID, etc. The ID must match exactly to return a profile. If multiple profiles are returned, select the user you want from the list.
You can search for any element in your Identity Set.
To perform a search do the following:

Enter the search terms in the search field.
View individual results by clicking a row. From the individual results you can do the following:
The information shown on this screen is explained in the following sections.
The following user information will be displayed if available:
List of all devices, including the date the device was last seen, device platform (iOS, Android, etc) and whetherLimit Ad Trackingis enabled for the device.
List of all available user attributes. Display priority is given to reserved user attributes:
All other user attributes will be displayed in alphabetical order.
User attribute values may be updated by different inbound data streams. For example, a profile may be created, attributes may be added, updated, or deleted. Each change triggers a timestamp change for the altered attribute. When resolving differences in attribute values for the same profile, the value with the latest timestamp is used.
A list of campaigns, showing Partner and Campaign name.
A list of allAudiencesthe user is a member of.
The Events tab will show a timeline of historical event data from the user,up until the previous day. Events can be filtered by Date, Input, Event Type and Device. In addition to filtering, you can also choose to highlight selected event names in the timeline.
Events are grouped in batches, with the input source in bold. Click a batch heading to view common attributes for the batch, or an event name to view attributes for the event. eCommerce events show details for the transaction and also for each product, including quantity and total price per product.

Click the Link button in the details view to copy a sharable direct link to the event to your clipboard.
As with theLive StreamYou can expand any event or batch to view the raw JSON data.

The User Activity View allows you to manually edit certain properties of individual user profiles. This can be useful if you need to correct profile data and you want the updated profile data to be immediately forwarded to your downstream connections.
Whenever you modify user profile data, you must select one of your configured inputs. This allows mParticle to route your changes through that input, updating the user profile, before finally forwarding the changes to any active, connected outputs.
To edit a profile’s user attributes:
On the Information tab for the profile, scroll to the User Attributes section and click theEditpencil icon next to the mParticle workspace where you want to make your changes.




On the Information tab for the profile, scroll to the Consent and Compliance section and click theEditpencil icon next to the mParticle workspace where you want to make your changes.



On the Information tab for the profile, look for the User Details section and click theEditpencil icon.




To add an identity to a user profile:


The System Alerts dashboard reports all errors returned when forwarding data to your connected outputs. This dashboard helps you to find any connections that are failing to forward data, and it can help you to begin debugging a connection you already know is experiencing problems by highlighting the specific errors reported.
To view system alerts, log into your mParticle account and navigate toActivity > System Alertsin the left nav bar.

The System Alerts dashboard lists all of your connections sorted by their alert volume, from high to low according to alerts reported during the last 12 hours.
You can view alerts reported during different date ranges by using theDatedropdown menu.
To view alerts reported for only the production or development environment, select the environment using theEnvironmentdropdown menu. You can also look for a specific connection with the search bar.
To view details on the specific alerts reported for a connection, select it from the list labeledConnections.

The alerts displayed are sorted by volume and organized according to their type. To view the volume of alerts for each input, click the+icon next to the alert type. You can search for a specific alert using the search bar on the System Alerts dashboard.

The following alert types are supported:

The Event Forwarding report provides information on your app’s incoming event data and the data that is forwarded to enabled output event services. This is where you can verify how much data mParticle captured per event, and how much data was forwarded.  If multiple configurations are enabled for an integration, the data sent to each configuration will be shown separately. We recommend checking this report if you notice any discrepancies in your vendor dashboards.
The report displays a daily summary of events, plus counts for each message type and event name, along with the inbound and outbound counts for each enabled service.  By default a summary of data for a full day is shown, but you can also select a specific hour to display hourly data.
You may notice differences between an inbound data count and an outbound data count. There are several reasons these differences may occur. Here are some good questions to start with:
Four events, called commerce events, capture information about financial transactions: product commerce events, purchase or refund commerce events, promotion commerce events, and impression commerce events.
Commerce events behave differently from other events:
In addition, the expansion behavior is different depending on the commerce event type:

Manage your consent and opt-out privacy obligations under the GDPR and CCPA with Data Privacy Controls. This feature is not prescriptive and there is no single way to implement consent or opt-out. Instead, mParticle gives you a simple, standard technique for storing and applying consent and opt-out choices. Consent state powers both GDPR consent and CCPA data sale opt-out.
This guide introduces you to mParticle’s data privacy control functionality and shows you how to collect an individual’s consent and apply it to your data flows.
Data privacy controls are flexible and customizable, allowing you to build any data flow or consent-based logic you need.
Use mParticle’s data privacy controls to help comply with CCPA’s “do not sell my data” requirement by collecting users who opt-out and blocking those users’ data from flowing to any ‘data sale’ output by:
GDPR defines consent as one method of lawful data processing. One common setup is to:
Once enabled and configured, data privacy work with the mParticle platform to ingest and pass on consent state:

Data privacy controls save user consent decisions and applies them to data flows.


The mParticle format for a single record of a user decision on a privacy prompt,.consent, is ourconsent_stateobject. This is used for both GDPR-style opt-in consent and for CCPA-style opt-out.
For each user or workspace, consent state can be stored for each possible combination of regulation and purpose. For each purpose, the following fields are supported.
All fields are optional, exceptconsented,timestamp_unixtime_ms,regulationandpurpose. Theregulationandpurposefields are built into the structure. Be sure to include your privacy and compliance experts when deciding how to implement optional fields.
Consent state can be logged via the HTTP API simply by including a consent state object in a batch, mirroring the structure of the user profile (above):
For detailed definitions of how to report consent state, review the sections of our API and SDK references that cover data privacy controls:
Additionally, ourintegration with OneTrustallows you to ingest customer consent states into mParticle.
Consent state is maintained per person on the User Profile using the structure defined above.
For testing consent, you can useUser Activity Viewto check that a consent was recorded correctly. Here is an example of how CCPA data sale opt-out will appear:

Consent state can be used to create conditions in the Audience Builder to check a users’ consent state as a requirement for audience inclusion or exclusion.
For example, for CCPA you may want to include only users who have NOT opted out of data sale, by adding a criteria like this:

For GDPR, you may want to include only users that have an opt-in consent for a given purpose, shown here as ‘Advertising’:

Consent state can be used to create forwarding rules that selectively filter data based on a users consent state, in real time and per-person.
For example, you can choose to only forward data from users who have given consent for a particular purpose.
For CCPA, you may want a forwarding rule to apply a data sale opt-out. In this example, users’ who have a consent state oftruefor the CCPA purpose ofdata_sale_opt_outwill NOT have their data forwarded (if the consent state is missing or false for that purpose, data will flow):
For GDPR, you may want a forwarding rule to only send data when a single purpose is consented:
If you set up a Forwarding Rule for an embedded kit integration, the iOS and Android SDKs will check consent status for the user on initialization. If the rule condition fails, the kit will not be initialized. Note that kits are only initialized when a session begins or on user change, so if consent status changes in the course of a session, while mParticle will immediately stop forwarding data to the kit, it is possible that an embedded kit may remain active and independently forwarding data to a partner from the client until the session ends.
When the consent state of a profile changes, that change can be communicated to mParticle event integrations. If theconsent_stateobject on an incoming event batch contains changes from the existing profile, mParticle adds a ‘system notification’ to the batch for each consent state change before the batch is sent to incoming forwarders. This notification contains the full old and new consent state objects:
There are currently two ways that consent state changes are forwarded to mParticle event integrations:
Some partners accept raw event batch data from mParticle, mostly for data storage or custom analytics use cases. For these partners, mParticle will forward the ‘system_notifications’ object with each relevant event batch. Forwarding of system notifications can be turned off with a user setting. Integrations that can currently receive the system notifications object include:
mParticle is working with other partners to support forwarding consent state changes as a Custom Event. These events contain the new consent state information as custom attributes, a custom event type of"Consent", and an event name of"Consent Given"or"Consent Rejected". These consent events are forwarded to supporting partners as standard custom events.
Partners that currently accept these custom consent state events include:
“GDPR Consent Change” is  listed as a data type in theIntegrations directoryand we will update this list as more partners add support. Please reach out to your success manager if you would like to distribute consent to an additional partner.
mParticle helps you respond todata subject requestsas mandated by the GDPR and CCPA regulations.
You can search for integrations that support data subject requests in theIntegrationspage. Search on categoryData Subject Request.
The California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) and the upcoming CPRA (California Privacy Rights Act) require that users can signal their privacy choices. In support of that requirement, you can ingestGlobal Privacy Control (GPC) signalswith mParticle.
Browsers append the GPC signal to HTTP requests and make it queryable via the DOM. This signal is designed to convey a person’s request to websites and services to not sell or share their personal information with third parties, perthe Global Privacy Control specification. This opt-out is at the browser level, allowing users to turn on the GPC signal for all or specific websites.
The workflow for ingesting and forwarding GPC signals via SDK or Events API:

This sample code show two options: mapping to a GDPR purpose and mapping to a user attribute.

mParticle is a customer data platform that makes it easy to collect and organize data before sending it to product analytics, A/B testing, marketing automation, and data warehousing tools.
mParticle provides several SDKs and APIs allowing you to collect data from a variety of sources, like a mobile app, web app, or data feeds from other SaaS providers.
You can collect two types of data with mParticle:
To demonstrate how mParticle works, you will learn how to track basic event data like page views and purchase events in a web app using the mParticle Android SDK. Then, you will learn how to send that data to a webhook. You will also learn how to manage your data quality by creating a data plan.
mParticle is extremely flexible. There are thirteen SDKs for specific platforms like web, iOS, and Android, in addition to several APIs. mParticle also provides over 250 integrations with data warehouse, analytics, and marketing automation tools.
To keep your first steps with mParticle quick and easy, this tutorial uses the Android SDK and a sample ecommerce app calledThe Higgs Shop.
mParticle’s Android SDK supports all Android devices and tablets, including Amazon Fire TV.
By initializing the Android SDK in your app, you gain access to useful methods you can call in your app’s code to send events and user data to mParticle.
In order to begin sending data from your app to mParticle, you will need access to an mParticle account and an API key.
This tutorial demonstrates how mParticle works using The Higgs Shop, a sample Android application written in theKotlinprogramming language.

Brazeis a comprehensive customer engagement platform that powers relevant experiences between consumers and brands they love. Braze helps brands foster human connection through interactive conversations across channels.
The Braze Feed allows mParticle to receive Braze interaction data for the iOS, Android and Web platforms. It also supports an ‘unbound’ feed for events, such as emails, that are not connected to an app platform.
The Braze Feed Integration supports four separate feeds: iOS, Android, Web and Unbound. You will need to create an input for each feed. You can create additional inputs fromSetup > Inputs, on theFeed Configurationstab.

For each feed, select an ‘Act as Application’ platform. For iOS, Android and Web, just select the appropriate option from the list. For your Unbound feed, leave this setting at ‘Select Application’.

All events from the Braze Feed will include any available user/device identifiers. Platform feeds will include basic device information.
The Braze Feed sends events for tracking campaign performance. Included as custom attributes for each event are Braze’s IDs for the relevant Campaign, News Feed Card, Button, Canvas, etc. You can find the ID’s in the relevant sections of the Braze Dashboard underAPI Identifier. SeeBraze’s Identifier Typesfor more details.
You can also see a full list of your API Identifiers on Braze’sDeveloper Console.
A full list of events and their allowed attributes can be found inBraze’s Documentation. For events withcampaign_id,canvas_id,canvas_step_id, andcanvas_variation_idlisted note that an individual event may have acampaign_id, thecanvas_*attributes, or neither.

You can import bulk data, both user attribute and events, from your data warehouse or legacy system using comma separated values (CSV) files. You can use this technique in all regions and with all outputs.
Use the following process to load user attribute or event data from CSV files:
1. Create CSV files
Prepare the CSV files for import. Files must follow the guidelines in this section.
Files must be sent in one of the following formats:
File name requirements:
Column names: specify fields according to ourJSON Schema, using dot notation.
User and Device IDs: as with any data sent to mParticle, you must include a column with at least one user ID or device ID.
Device IDs
User IDs
User attributes:
If you include user attributes, for each, include a column named asuser_attributes.key, wherekeyis a user attribute key. For example:
Attribute names with spaces are allowed and do not require quotes. All the keys listed in theJSON Referenceare supported.
Events:
Commerce events: use columns with the following names for commerce events.
Only one product per event can be included for commerce events uploaded via CSV.
Data types:
All data in the CSV is converted to a string. The only exceptions to this are values that require a particular data type, such as MPID or IDFA.
mParticle maintains an SFTP server where you will drop your CSV files.
Use the following instructions to securely retrieve your credentials and find the hostname and path to use when you drop your files on the SFTP server.
To get your SFTP username and password:
Configure the Custom CSV Feed as input. This step provides the hostname and folder path on the SFTP server where your CSV files must be dropped.
To configure the Custom CSV Feed:
VisitSETUP > Inputs > Feedsin the mParticle UI and click theAdd Feed Inputbutton, then select Custom CSV Feed from the list.
If you’ve already added the Custom CSV Feed, it won’t show up in the list. Scroll through the list of feeds until you seeCustom CSV Feed, and then click the large plus sign in the gray bar to create a new feed. You need one feed for each different event type.
Enter the following values:
Files on the SFTP location are added to the processing queue nearly immediately.  Depending on file count and file size, a backlog may develop. You can observe how much data has been processed using Data Master and your outbound connections. There is no notification of processing progress or completion.

Mixpanel’smission is to increase the rate of innovation. Companies use Mixpanel to analyze how & why users engage, convert, and retain in real-time on web, mobile, and IoT devices, and then use the data to improve their products.
If you are new to setting up Mixpanel’s Mobile App Analytics, your best place to start is Mixpanel itself and the below are must-reads before proceeding:
When mParticle sends data to Mixpanel, Mixpanel’s APIs are utilized.  This allows mParticle to implement server side data forwarding and supports our value proposition to customers of not requiring that additional app SDK components be continually added and updated for integrations.
In order to enable mParticle’s integration with Mixpanel, you will need an account with Mixpanel and have your Mixpanel Token for mParticle configuration. Your Mixpanel Token can be found at the Mixpanel topic,Find Project Token.
mParticle’s SDK supports nearly all of the Mixpanel SDK specific features natively. When you use the mParticle SDK, mParticle events will be transformed using Mixpanel-compliant naming conventions and activate the corresponding features automatically.
One of the key features of Mixpanel is funnel tracking, this feature requires a consistent approach to identifying your users as they sign up, and progress from being only identifiable by their device, to having a unique “logged in” ID.
mParticle manages this process using itsIDSync feature. IDSync gives you granular control over how user profiles are managed. To support IDSync, mParticle maintains a hierarchy of different ID types.
A traditional Mixpanel implementation, using the Mixpanel SDK, manages sign-up funnels by using the following process:
If your project has Mixpanel’sID Mergefeature enabled, the call toidentifywill connect pre- and post-authentication events when appropriate.
If your project does not have ID Merge enabled,identifywill change the user’s local distinct_id to the unique ID you pass. Events tracked prior to authentication will not be connected to the same user identity. If ID Merge is disabled,  Alias can be used to tie the original Distinct ID (an anonymous device ID) and the new Distinct ID (a unique User ID) together in Mixpanel.
If this process is not followed correctly, funnel tracking won’t be possible, as Mixpanel will see the two Distinct IDs as two completely separate users.
If you wish to use Mixpanel’s funnel tracking features, here is one option for implementing with mParticle:
This option is recommended for new implementations.This option lets your Mixpanel user profiles mirror those maintained by mParticle. This option lets your mParticle Identity strategy take care of aliasing for you, before your data ever reaches Mixpanel.
For this to work, you need to have selected an Identity Strategy that supports funnel tracking, such as theProfile Conversion Strategy. If you use the Profile Conversion Strategy and mParticle’sCustomer IDas your logged-in ID type, a sign-up flow works as follows:
To use this option, set theExternal Identity TypetomParticle IDin theConfiguration Settings.
Note that this example is the minimum necessary to demonstrate the required sign-up flow and does not include additional features, such as completion handlers. Refer to the full Identity documentation:
To support each feature in theSupported Featurestable above, multiple methods will need to be implemented. The following table shows the mapping between each feature and SDK methods.
Tracking standard events in the mParticle SDK is fairly straightforward. Events can be standalone or include event attributes. mParticle attributes are converted to Mixpanel properties automatically when forwarded.
mParticle sends data to different Mixpanel endpoints depending on the age of the events:
Super properties allow certain properties that you want to include with each event you send. Generally, these are things you know about the user rather than about a specific event, for example, the user’s age, gender, or source. These super properties will be automatically included with all tracked events. Super properties are saved to device storage, and will persist across invocations of your app.
Both Mixpanel and mParticle have the ability to set specific attributes for the user which will persist until overwritten.
If you have enabled the ‘Include User Attributes’ setting, then any messages with type ScreenView or AppEvent will include the email user identity (if available) and all user attributes.  TheSetUserAttributemethod can be used to set user attributes. This method will overwrite the values of any existing user attributes.
mParticle’s attribute naming conventions closely resemble standard Mixpanel attributes, which a few exceptions:
These mParticle attributes will just have the leading $ removed:
If these attributes are seen, they will be replaced with Mixpanel attributes:
With available user identity info and user attributes, standard people data being sent includes:
Data being sent in the $set section:
In order to track revenue using mParticle and Mixpanel, you need to ensure that mParticle is forwarding on relevant data by enabling theUse Mixpanel Peoplesetting.  If the mParticle SDK method has been called to log an event, the event and one event attribute have been set up for LTV tracking, and the event is not excluded by an account policy, a transaction message will be sent to Mixpanel.
Only specific data will be considered as part of the transactional funnel. Standard message data format is:
Data being sent in the transactions section:
Event batches sent to Mixpanel using the server-side web integration will also send the following data:
Note that this data depends on thehttp_header_user_agentfield so they will only be set if a value is included in the batch.
By default, mParticle sends data to Mixpanel’s US Servers, but offers an EU Data Localization option for theiringestion API, which allows data to be sent and stored in the Mixpanel EU Data Center (see Mixpanel’s documentation onStoring Your Data in the European Union). This EU Residency is not automatically set within a Mixpanel project. You can find steps on how to set EU Data Localization for your Mixpanel project withinthe Mixpanel documentation. In mParticle, theMixpanel Target Server Configuration Settingmust be set toEU Residency Server.

Amplitudeprovides product analytics that helps companies leverage cross-platform behavioral data to drive user growth.
To activate mParticle’s integration with Amplitude, you need the Amplitude API Key for each app that you’d like to set up.  Your API key is listed on theAmplitude Project Settings page.
The Amplitude integration requires themParticle Amplitude Kitwhen connected to a web input. If you are initializing the web SDK using theSnippet Optionthen the Kit is automatically included for you. If you areSelf Hostingthe SDK then you need to add this kit manually into your source code.
mParticle will forward User Identities and Attributes to Amplitude, even if there are no events in the batch.
Every event in Amplitude has a main Device ID field. mParticle populates this field as follows:
Amplitude also has dedicated fields for particular Device IDs, such as IDFA and Android ID. These will be populated if the ID is available. SeeField Mappings, for more information.
Amplitude requires either a Device ID or a User ID. User ID can be mapped as Email, Customer ID or mParticle ID. If no accepted identifiers are present, data will not be forwarded.
By default, mParticle forwards web data to Amplitude client-side, by directly invoking Amplitude’s Javascript methods. Optionally, you can choose to forward web data server-to-server in theConnection Settings. Note that if you choose this option, your incoming data must have your selected User ID to be forwarded.
By default, mParticle sends data to the Amplitude organization’s US endpoint for theHTTP API, but Amplitude offers a different endpoint for EU organizations. In mParticle, theAmplitude Organization Configuration Settingallows you to select a target Amplitude organization location.
mParticle will forward all screen views to Amplitude with the Amplitude Event Type set to “Viewed ScreenName”, whereScreenNameis the screen name passed to thelogScreenSDK method (or the name of the screen’s Activity class if you’re using automatic screen tracking on Android).
mParticle will forward all session start and session end events to Amplitude with the Amplitude Event Type set tosession_startandsession_end.
Each valid eCommerce event sent to mParticle is expanded into multiple events before being translated and forwarded to Amplitude. While this expansion applies to all eCommerce transactions, the resulting events are dependent on the type of eCommerce event being forwarded and the number of products in the event.
Note: mParticle will not attempt to forward eCommerce Events to Amplitude which contain no Products.
The eCommerce events resulting from the expansion that may be forwarded to Amplitude are:
Each valid eCommerce event sent to mParticle will result in a transaction level event being sent to Amplitude. This event contains a summary of the transaction, including a JSON array of the products sent in the initial eCommerce event.
The name given to the Transaction and Item Level Events is determined from theProduct Actionprovided on the eCommerce Event sent to mParticle.
Custom events logged via mParticle’slogEventSDK method and their attributes will be forwarded to Amplitude, with the event name passed tologEventas the Amplitude Event Type. An event namemustbe specified or an error will be returned.
Attribution Custom events will be forwarded to Amplitude prefixed with the attribution provider in the event name.  For example,[AppsFlyer] attribution.  Event Attributes that are included with the event are forwarded to Amplitude in user_properties, also prefixed with the attribution provider.
mParticle will forward all push registration events to Amplitude with the Amplitude Event Type set toPush Registration. All Field Mappings defined in this documentation will be forwarded too.
If theSend Application State Transitionssetting is enabled, Application State Transition events will be forwarded to Amplitude as follows:
Only for web requests, mParticle will extract OS and browser info from HTTP user agent.
Similar to Amplitude’s SDK behavior,os_nameandos_versionwill be populated with browser info. For that reason, mParticle will send 2 additionalCustom User Properties,web_os_nameandweb_os_version, that will contain OS info. SeeAmplitude’s doc.
mParticle will also populatedevice_brandanddevice_modelfrom the HTTP user agent if theExtract Device Family from User Agentsetting is enabled. With this setting enabled, if mParticle cannot determine the device brand or model, it will populatedevice_brandwith the same value as is set forweb_os_name. Note, the device values may differ slightly between S2S events and events sent through the Amplitude web kit.

This section describes the configuration settings necessary to activate mParticle’s event tracking integration with Facebook.  The event tracking integration enables conversion tracking for Facebook advertising campaigns.
Facebook has limits around the number of unique event names and attributes their platform can process as noted here:https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/android/current/class/AppEventsLogger/
Event data from mParticle to Facebook is typically sent server side.  However, Web data can be sent client or server side based on your implementation and settings.  These different options require different settings:
You need to perform a few steps in Facebook to create aFacebook Pixel S2Sconnection.
Facebook recommends sending the same pixel event twice - once from the browser and once from the server. If done incorrectly, this can result in duplicate events appearing in Facebook. The following steps walk through how to configure this within mParticle.
To do this using mParticle, you will need to perform the following steps:
Ideally, all Web data sent to mParticle will be sent through the mParticle Web SDK, but it is still possible to deduplicate events outside of this flow if necessary. To ensure redundant events sent through Facebook Pixel and the Facebook Conversions API are correctly deduplicated when they reach Facebook, two conditions must be met:
If you use the mParticle Web SDK and server-side web integration, then this will be automatically handled.
If you need to manually assign asource_message_idvia the web SDK and server-side separately, use the following API:
You can also assign asource_message_idto commerce events:
Note that your workspace will need to be on event batching in order to leverage passing a customsource_message_idto the Web SDK for this to work.  If you are not on web batching, please contact your customer success manager.
Visit theFacebook Business Help CenterandFacebook For Developersfor more information on the subject of deduplication.
Please run through the following steps to confirm your settings are correct:
If you run into issues with either of the above steps, please repeat the steps described inConfiguring Facebook Pixel Server-to-Server.
The Facebookadvertiser_tracking_enabledfield is set based on theatt_authorization_statusandlimit_ad_trackingfields as defined below.  Check theiOS14 Implementation guidefor more information.
Ifatt_authorization_statusis available:
Ifatt_authorization_statusis not available, thelimit_ad_trackingfield is evaluated:
mParticle will send a variety of user data fields to Facebook for advanced matching. The specific fields sent depends on if Facebook Pixel server-side forwarding is enabled or not.
Facebook Pixel Server-Side Forwarding Disabled
mParticle will hash and send the following fields to Facebook when they are set for a user.
Facebook Pixel Server-Side Forwarding Enabled
mParticle’s Facebook integration supportscustom mappingswhich allows you to map your events and attributes for Facebook. mParticle provides mappings for the following Facebook event types:
When setting up the custom mappings, the fb_content_type can provide additional information on the event to be used forCollaborative Ads.  The acceptable values for fb_content_type are:
If a value provided for fb_content_type is not in the above list, the value sent will beproduct.
mParticle forwards the mParticle product events Added to Cart and Added to Wishlist to Facebook using Facebook’s corresponding pre-defined event names.  mParticle Product Views are forwarded to Facebook as the pre-defined event “Viewed Content”.  The unit price, currency, product category, and SKU are passed to Facebook as well.  See below for a sample Added to Cart event call using the Facebook SDK, and an equivalent call using the mParticle SDK.
Purchase events logged through mParticle’s eCommerce SDK methods will be forwarded to Facebook using Facebook’s “Purchased” pre-defined event name.
All custom app events, which are logged via mParticle’slogEventSDK method, will be forwarded to Facebook as custom app events, using the event name passed to mParticle’slogEventSDK method.
For theWebplatform, mParticle will forward screen views as ‘PageView’ events.
For theiOS/tvOSandAndroidplatforms, screen views are supported by custom mappings. Reference thecustom mappingssection for more.
There are several fields only accepted by server-to-server Web connections. These fields and the mParticle fields they are set from are listed below:
*Custom data fields can also be set via custom mappings or E-Commerce event fields. See the relevant sections for more details.

You can opt in to V5 of the Braze SDK by selecting the version in a connection setting in the mParticle UI.
For more details about upgrading to V5 of the Braze web SDK,follow these instructions, whether you self-host or load mParticle via snippet/CDN..
If you are using version 2 of the @mparticle/web-appboy-kit, you will need totransition to @mparticle/web-braze-kit per the instructions herebefore following the above instructions as well.
Brazeis a comprehensive customer engagement platform that powers relevant experiences between consumers and brands they love. Braze helps brands foster human connection through interactive conversations across channels.
Braze offers a broad range of functionality via their solution and it is critically important that you work directly with your Braze representative to ensure that you are correctly planning and implementing their features.  mParticle does not recommend enabling forwarding to Braze until you have completed the Braze planning process with your Braze team.
ThemParticle SDKallows you to include the Braze kit which allows Braze interface components (images, layout files, etc.) and as a result supports many Braze features, including:
Features are supported by the mParticle SDK only after you install themParticle Braze Kit(formerly Appboy), which then forwards data from your app to Braze.
Features are supported in two ways:
The mParticle S2S APIallows you to send data server side (API reference). The S2S API supports iOS, Android and Web data. In this scenario, mParticle forwards data via Braze’s REST API which supports a limited set of features.
For server-side data to be forwarded to Braze, it must include your selected External Identity Type. To relax this requirement, see the Disable External ID Constraint connection setting.
The following event types can be forwarded to Braze via S2S:
The Braze solution offers features that involve Braze-proprietary user interaction components including Newsfeed, In-App Messaging, and Feedback.
To use Braze with one of the mParticle mobile SDKs, please review the kit documentation for theAndroid SDKor theiOS SDK.
You must directly call the Braze kit to use the Newsfeed, In-App Messaging, and Feedback features. Examples of directly calling a kit are provided for bothAndroidandiOS.
To comply with Apple’s iOS 17 privacy manifest it is required to update to Braze SDK version 9.0.0 or later which is included by the mParticle Braze Kit version 8.60 or later. Note that it is also required to update to at least version 8.24.0 of the mParticle SDK if you are not creating your own Braze instance and passing it to the mParticle Braze Kit in order for this functionality to work.
There are also additional steps required to comply which are outlined in the Braze documentationhere.
If you are creating your own Braze instance and passing it to the mParticle Kit as described in the iOS App Launch Tracking sectionbelow, you can simply follow instructions in the above Braze documentation directly.
If not, you will still need to follow the above Braze documentation, with the following exceptions:
Push notifications work differently for web and for mobile.
mParticle integrates with Braze to allow web push notifications to further engage your visitors. We integrated Braze’sSoft Push Prompts, which allows you to ask your user if they’d like to stay in touch before the browser alerts them to allow notifications. This is done since the browser throttles how often you can prompt the user for push notifications, and if the user denies permission, you can never ask them again. See below for directions on how to implement push notifications, which customizes Braze’simplementation instructionsto work with mParticle.
Configure your site
mParticle hosts Braze’s service worker in order to prevent unpredictable versioning issues. Do not use Braze’s service-worker.js CDN.
Configure Safari Push
Create a “Prime for Push” in-app messaging Campaign on the Braze dashboard. Note that this is anIn-App MessagingCampaign, and not aPush Notificationmessaging campaign.
Optionally, you can change the name and location ofservice-worker.js. The following example will clarify the steps:
As long as the Braze Kit is included in your app, mParticle will pass any Push Notifications from Braze to the kit for display. However, you will need to provide credentials in the Braze dashboard.
See the mainiOSandAndroidPush Notification documentation for more detail.
On iOS, when a user launches your app by tapping on a push notification, you may see these launches recorded in the mParticle dashboard but not in Braze. This happens due to a race condition between the Braze SDK initializing and the app handling the push notification.
To work around this, you’ll need to create your own instance of Braze in yourapplicationDidFinishLaunchingmethod of your app delegate and pass it to the Braze kit before initializing the mParticle SDK. You’ll also need to tell the kit not to process push notifications and instead handle them yourself. This ensures that Braze is initialized and ready to receive the push notifications immediately upon app launch.
Note that by implementing your own instance of Braze, you will lose the ability to use the following Braze configuration options in the mParticle dashboard, as you’ll be passing those options to Braze yourself on app launch. Only implement this if you need push notification app launches reported to Braze:
All other Braze configuration options in the mParticle dashboard will continue to work as usual, and any of the above can be set in your app when you create the Braze instance by setting the relevant options on the Braze configuration object. See the example code for thedidFinishLaunchingWithOptionsmethod below.
The following is mostly following the instructions fromBraze’s “Manual push integration”documentation, with the addition of some mParticle specific code in thedidFinishLaunchingWithOptionsmethod.
Please note that because we are following Braze’s“Manual push integration”instructions, you should not set the configuration option,configuration.push.automation = true, as described in Braze’sAutomatic push integrationdocumentation as it will cause conflicts.
The Braze kits foriOSandAndroidsupport Braze’s automatic location tracking features, provided that the appropriate app-level permissions are granted by the user.
For Android push notifications you will need to provide your Server Key in your app settings page underPush Notification Settings.

For iOS push notifications you will need to upload your APNs Push SSL certificate to Braze. See theBraze documentationfor more.
mParticle supports the ability to conduct A/B testing with different integrations by sending a sample of users and their data to one integration and a different sample of users and their data to a different integration.  If you are using the mParticle SDK for Braze deploymentandcalling Braze methods directly, when instrumenting with the mParticle SDKyou must ensure that the Braze kit is active in the App before calling a Braze method.  This is very important and ensures that you are not inadvertently calling Braze methods for apps/users that are not part of an Braze A/B sample.
mParticle supports the ability to forward server-side events for the Roku platform. Note that only data that includes your selected External Identity Type can be forwarded to Braze.
mParticle will always forward events if sent via the mParticle SDK, provided you have included the Braze kit, but will only forward events sent via the mParticle S2S API if the following conditions apply:
Braze maintains several instances.   As part of theConfiguration Settings, you need to specify which one your data should be forwarded to.  You can tell yourBraze Instancefrom the URL of your Braze Dashboard.
Check with your Braze account manager if you are unsure which Braze instance you are using.
There is also the ability to specify a Custom instance, which allows you to specify separate endpoints for REST, SDK and Javascript.
Usinghttps://or a trailing/in your endpoint address will cause errors.
In order to activate the Braze integration, you will need your Braze App Identifier API key and your “App Group REST API Key” if using the S2S API.

Depending on the setting value forBundle Commerce Event Data(seeConnection Settingsfor more), Commerce Events may be expanded based on the number of products, promotions, or impressions, respectively. Ex:
A purchase event is mapped and optionally-expanded to Braze purchase event(s) as described above.
In addition to theCommon Commerce Fields, the following information is also captured, if defined:
All other product-based commerce event types are mapped and optionally-expanded to Braze custom event(s) as described above. Note:
As such, all relevant product and transaction information is conveyed via thepropertiesfield.
In addition to theCommon Commerce Fields, the following information is also captured, if defined:
All product-based commerce events, regardless of type, capture these common fields in thepropertiesdictionary in the following way:
Note: For web kit data, in order to forward theTransactionId, you must include thetransactionAttributesas the fifth argument below. See ourAPI docsfor how to build transaction attributes.
Whenpromotionsare expanded, eachpromotionis converted to its own outgoing Braze event.
Alternatively, if expansion isn’t toggled,promotionsare included in a nested collection in a single outgoing Braze event.
Whenimpressionsare expanded, eachproductfrom eachimpressionis converted to its own outgoing Braze event.
Alternatively, if expansion isn’t toggled,impressionsand their associatedproductsare included in a nested collection in a single outgoing Braze event.
Your screen view events will be passed to Braze using the screen name that you passed to ourlogScreenSDK method, as the event name.
If you are using automatic screen tracking in our Android SDK, the automatically-generated screen view events will be forwarded to Braze using the name of the associated Activity class.
To send session start and end events for S2S to Braze, enable theForward Session Eventsconnection setting. After enabling this setting, session start and end events are forwarded to Braze as custom events with the namesSession StartandSession End. When available, session IDs are also sent in thesession_idproperty on all session starts and ends, screen view, and custom events.
However, note that mParticle SDK kits do not support session events, which are never forwarded with a kit, whether or notForward Session Eventsis enabled.
All custom events will be forwarded to Braze using the event name that you passed to yourlogEventSDK method.  All event attributes will be forwarded to Braze as Braze custom event properties using the attribute names you passed to yourlogEventSDK method as well.
Note: Braze documentation indicates that the following reserved keywords can’t be used as custom event properties:
To learn more, visit the Braze documentation:
The table below describes how the mParticle integration maps user attributes to Braze’s profile attributes.
Braze advises tocoerce data typeson user attributes shared with Braze before sending Production volume data. This ensures that the custom attributes received by Braze are of the expected data type. This can impact segment building and triggering campaigns.  If incorrect data types are identified after data has been flowing, there can be extra work to true up the users with the legacy data type on those attributes.  To give Braze’s type detection a better opportunity to evaluate data types properly, you can enable the following 2 Connection Settings:Enable API Custom Attribute Type DetectionandEnable Kit Custom Attribute Type Detection.
By default, mParticle forwards all available user attributes and user identities to Braze, including attributes added during profile enrichment. You can disable this behavior in theConnection Settings.   Only data which is sent to Braze Server to Server can be enriched.
A User Attribute can be mapped to a Braze Subscription Group ID. Requests sent to mParticle containing the mapped User Attribute, with a validtrueorfalsevalue, will determine if the user in the request should be subscribed (true) or unsubscribed (false) from the group. This allows for dynamic subscription management based on user attributes.
To configure Subscription Group Mapping:
Map the desired User Attribute to the Subscription Group ID in the mParticle dashboard.
Send the mapped User Attribute on your event batch to mParticle with a boolean value.
A misconfigured Subscription Group mapping can affect how your data is forwarded to Braze. If you notice your Subscription Groups are not being updated, check the following:
Please note that Braze will only return an error in these cases when the Subscription Group attribute update is theonlyitem in the request sent to Braze. If the request contains valid events and/or purchases, Braze will process these and skip the Subscription Group update. This also means that you will only see Subscription Group errors in theSystem Alertspage when the invalid Subscription Group update is theonlyitem in the request.
Braze uses the$google_ad_user_dataand$google_ad_personalizationcustom attribute keys to receive consent status for Google’s EU User Consent Policy. The Boolean sent to these keys signify that a user has granted or denied consent to a marketer. As per theirCollecting consent for EEA, UK, and Switzerland end usersdocumentation, this value must be sent to Google as a Custom Attribute.
To configure user consent forwarding under this value, a mapping should be set-up leveraging mParticle’s notion of Consent Purposes. To learn more about handling user consent within mParticle’s platform, see the following docs:Data Privacy Controls.
Once a Consent Purpose is set up, user consent information can be associated with it in subsequent Event Batches. The Consent Purpose data mapping can then be configured for downstream forwarding via the Consent Mapping connection setting.
Braze occasionally makes breaking changes to their SDK, so if you call Braze directly in your code, you will have to update your code to ensure your website performs as expected when updating versions of Braze.
We recommend you use version 5 of the Braze SDK.  You only need to make code changes if you directly call the Braze SDK from your code. Otherwise, you can simply selectVersion 5from the mParticle connection settings.
If you are upgrading from V3, you should check the breaking changes from theBraze V4 Changelogas well asBraze V5 Changelog, in addition to theV4/5 migration guideto learn about the breaking changes.  The most significant breaking changes are the replacement of theappboyclass name withbrazefrom V3 to V4, in addition to the removal and renaming of several APIs.  If you are updating from V4 to V5, there are fewer changes, but you’d follow the same defensive code recommendations below.
You can opt into the latest major version of the Braze Web SDK whether you implement mParticle’s Web SDK using npm or our snippet/CDN.
Note that the following is only one example, and demonstrates an upgrade from V3 to V5.  Everywhere you manually callappboy(or other deprecated API) needs to be updated similar to the below. If you are using NPM, you can skip to step 4.  Please be sure to test your site fully in development prior to releasing.
Step 2: Roll out code changes to be used before you opt in to using Version 4 of the Braze Web SDK so that it works under both versions:
Step 3: Whether you are using the snippet or self-hosting, you need to navigate to your Braze connection settings and selectVersion 5from theBraze Web SDK Versiondrop down.
Step 4: After you opt in, you can simplify your code. We recommend testing and waiting at least 24 hours between opting in and removing previous instances ofappboyand doing thorough testing of your application in a development environment to ensure everything is working:
Step 4: Push Notifications via service-worker.js
If you use Push Notifications, we have updated theservice-worker.jsfile.  In our testing, Braze’s push notifications work as expected regardless of what version of the service-worker is used, but we recommend updating this file to ensure future compatibility.  In yourservice-worker.jsfile, update the code to referencehttps://static.mparticle.com/sdk/js/braze/service-worker-5.5.0.jsinstead ofhttps://static.mparticle.com/sdk/js/braze/service-worker-3.5.0.js.  Yourservice-worker.jsfile should now contain:
The legacy @mparticle/web-appboy-kit from NPM includes version 2 of the Braze Web SDK.  As part of this update, we’ve created a newBraze web kit repoto replace our deprecatedAppboy web kit repo.  If you are still using@mparticle/web-appboy-kit, you will need to consider the breaking changes Braze made between V2 and V3 of the Braze SDK (foundhere) as well as the instructions above to get from V2 to V5 of the Braze SDK.

AppsFlyeris a leading Mobile Attribution & Marketing Analytics platform that allows app marketers to easily measure the performance of all their marketing channels - paid, organic and social - from a single real-time dashboard.
mParticle’s integration with AppsFlyer includes a required Kit integration and an optional server-side integration. The Kit forwards event data from your app to AppsFlyer on the client side, and also handles app install attribution, uninstall tracking, and deeplinking, including deferred deeplinking. Supplementary data from outside your app can be forwarded to mParticle via our Events API and sent on to AppsFlyer server-to-server.
Google has several notions of user-provided consent.  Two of these apply to AppsFlyer events:ad_user_dataandad_personalization. These represent consent forad user dataandad personalization.
To configure user consent forwarding under this value, a mapping should be set-up leveraging mParticle’s notion of Consent Purposes. To learn more about handling user consent within mParticle’s platform, see the following docs:Data Privacy Controls.
Once a Consent Purpose is set up, user consent information can be associated with it in subsequent Event Batches. The Consent Purpose data mapping can then be configured for downstream forwarding via the User Consent Data Mapping connection setting.
In the absence of a user-defined consent value for thead_user_dataandad_personalizationfields via the Consent Purpose mapping, a default value can be optionally configured via a separate drop-down setting for each consent type. When no user consent is provided, the default status is used, if specified.
Caution: It is recommended that in the long term, you set up user-specified consent through the Consent Purpose mapping, such that the user consent is correctly forwarded to Google. It is your responsibility as a Data Controller to stay compliant under the GDPR, and set up user consent collection for downstream forwarding. The consent default setting can be deprecated in the future.
mParticle’s AppsFlyer integration requires that you add the AppsFlyer Kit to your iOS or Android app. Just by adding the binary to your app:
mParticle publishes the AppsFlyer Kit as separate iOS and Android libraries which have a transitive dependency on the mParticle core libraries. You can add them to your app via Carthage, Cocoapods, Swift Package Manager, or Gradle:
Refer to theApple SDKandAndroid SDKguides to read more about kits.
AppsFlyer’s SDK requires the forwarding of the Google Play Install Referrer Intent. The AppsFlyer kit will take care of this for you as long as you’ve added mParticle’sReferrerReceiverto you manifest, or you are manually forwarding the Intent to ourReferrerReceiverclass. The mParticle SDK will then forward the Install Referrer intent to each configured kit, including AppsFlyer.
Please see theAndroid SDK setup guideto ensure your manifest is configured properly.
The AppsFlyer SDK exposes client-side deep linking and attribution APIs, all of which are supported by the mParticle AppsFlyer kit and are covered in this section. The core use-cases are:
Each platform has very specific requirements to ensure that the above functionality is supported. The minimum requirements are:
mParticle’s SDKs will automatically initialize the AppsFlyer SDK, forwarding the requiredUIApplicationlifecycle events and thecontinueUserAcivityevents for iOS and Android, as well as registering a delegate such that you can retrieve deep linking and attribution parameters on the client-side to customize your user’s in-app experience.
Specifically, the AppsFlyer SDK exposes one distinct callback:
mParticle’s API includes a wrapper for this callback, and both the iOS and Android kits expose a constant to inform you when the callback has been fired and if it was successful. On both platforms, the iOS/Android kit will register a delegate/callback with the AppsFlyer SDK on initialization and for the lifetime of the app’s process, and will call your completion handler block (iOS) orAttributionListener(Android) whenever there is new conversion data available.
When a user clicks a OneLink link, the AppsFlyer SDK retrieves available OneLink data from the AppsFlyer servers. Then, the UDL API calls thedidResolveDeepLink()method which returns aDeepLinkResultobject containing a status and (if successful) aDeepLinkobject containing thedeep_link_valueanddeep_link_sub1-10parameters you can use to customize the resulting in-app outcome.
However, when users deep link directly using universal or app links, thedidResolveDeepLinkmethod returns the full link unparsed since the app opens directly without going through AppsFlyer first. You can read more about AppsFlyer’s deep linking methodshere.
The parameters returned in these results will match the result of the AppsFlyer SDK, as documented forAndroidandiOS.
See the deep linking documentation foriOSandAndroidfor more information.
The following core test scenarios that should be verified:
The AppsFlyer Kit will forward app events and eCommerce events to AppsFlyer.Custom Mappingsare available to map your custom app events ontoAppsFlyer’s event names. Refer to the iOS and Android SDK docs for details on instrumenting your app for event tracking:
eCommerce
App Events
Note that AppsFlyer enforces alimit of 45 charactersfor event names.
The source code for each kit, as well as sample apps, are available on Github:
mParticle can forward app events and commerce events received via ourEvents APItoAppsFlyer’s server-API. Note that AppsFlyer requires data to be linked to a unique AppsFlyer ID, generated client-side by the AppsFlyer Kit. mParticle stores the AppsFlyer ID in its internal user profile. This means that:
For iOS 14, mParticle will send theattfield based on theatt_authorization_statusto AppsFlyer in their expectedformat. Check theiOS14 Implementation guidefor more information.

The mParticle Facebook Audiences integration allows you to forward mParticle audience data directly to a Facebook Ads Manager account for use with Facebook Custom Audiences, making it easy to target existing or prospective customers.
You must have Full Access to the Facebook Ads account you want to forward your audience data to. To check if you have Full Access:


The Facebook Ads account you are connecting to must have accepted the following terms of service:
To see if you’ve accepted the terms of service:

If you want to forward users’ Facebook IDs with your audience data, you must have the Facebook Application ID number for your app or integration. To find your Facebook Application ID, you need to access the Facebook Developer Dashboard. To find your Facebook App ID:

Once you have satisfied the prerequisites described above, follow the steps below to set up the mParticle Facebook audience integration.
Setting up and using the audience integration for Facebook includes three stages:







Check the box next to each of the following user identities you want to forward to Facebook with your audience:
Email addresses and Facebook IDs result in higher match rates with Facebook users because they are more unique across the Facebook platform, so it’s recommended to use these identities whenever they are available.

CheckEnable Multi-Key Audienceto have an additional audience forwarded to Facebook that includes all of the user identities you selected in the previous step.
CheckMatch on User Attributesto have mParticle forward all available attributes from the following list for each user. This can increase the match rate for your audience. All user attributes are hashed asSHA256before being forwarded to Facebook.
To create a value-based lookalike audience, checkIs Value Based Audience, and use the User Attribute Representing Value dropdown menu to select an mParticle user attribute to forward to Facebook.
UnderCustomer File Source, select one of the following as the source of your audience data:
Select the identity you want to forward to Facebook as an external email address from theExternal Email Identity Typedropdown.
Select the identity you want to be hashed and forwarded to Facebook for use as an external unique ID from theMulti-Key External ID Typedropdown.
To find your new custom audience(s):


mParticle deletes the downstream audience when you delete an audience from mParticle.
Following are the user identities and device identities that can be forwarded to Facebook. Identities that are hashed asSHA256are noted.
The “match rate” for a Facebook audience refers to the percentage of your forwarded user data that Facebook successfully matches to active Facebook users.
When you connect an mParticle audience with Facebook, several user identifiers are included for each audience member (such as email addresses, phone numbers, Facebook user IDs, or mobile advertiser IDs). After you send an audience from mParticle to Facebook, Facebook attempts to match these identifiers to user profiles on Facebook. The match rate indicates how successful Facebook is in finding corresponding user profiles for the identifiers you provided.
There are several factors that can impact your match rate:
A higher match rate means that more of your user data was successfully matched to Facebook users, allowing you to reach a larger audience with your ads or other marketing efforts. However, it’s important to keep in mind that not all of your user data may match with Facebook users, and the match rate may vary from one audience to another.
You can use the mParticle audiences integration to create value-based lookalike audiences. These audiences target users who share similar characteristics and behaviors with your existing high-value customers.
However, unlike traditional lookalike audiences, which are based solely on demographic or interest similarities, value-based lookalike audiences are generated using an attribute that reflects the monetary value or profitability of your customers. For example, if you select a lifetime value attribute, Facebook will create a lookalike audience composed of users that have a higher lifetime value.
By default, mParticle only forwards users in a value-based audience to Facebook if the value of their “value reprepresenting attribute” is greater than 0. You can include values equaling zero by checkingAllow Zero Valueswhen creating your value-based audience.
You can learn more about value-based lookalike audiences inFacebook’s documentation.
As of July 2, 2018, Facebook requires that all new audiences disclose whether their data was collected from customers directly, collected from partners, or both. You can provide this information in the connection settings when connecting an audience to Facebook via the Customer File Source setting.
You can learn more about the Customer File Source Requirement inFacebook’s documentation.
Facebook does not allow more than500 custom audiencesto be created per Facebook Ads account. If you attempt to forward more than 500 audiences to Facebook, an error will be returned.
The Facebook Audience integration uses bulk forwarding. This means that instead of forwarding audience data in real time, mParticle adds updates to a queue. By default, mParticle forwards data to Facebook from this queue whenever one of the following conditions is met:
Before activating your new connection, or when troubleshooting issues, please be aware of the following:
During steps 4-5 of the first stage of the setup process, you connect your Facebook account to mParticle. Make sure that you use a Facebook account that has been granted access to the Facebook Ads account you will forward your audiences to, and make sure that after connecting your Facebook account that you use theFacebook Account IDdropdown menu to select the Facebook Ads account.
It is possible to have access to multiple Ads accounts, so make sure that you selected the correct Ads account when creating your output.
ReadAccess to a Facebook Ads accountfor instructions on how to make sure your Facebook account has the correct access. If you do not have the correct access, reach out to your Facebook Ads account administrator.
If you are trying to forward Facebook IDs from mParticle to Facebook, you must provide your Facebook application ID.
Often referred to as an app ID, a Facebook Application ID is a unique ID assigned to your application when you register it on the Facebook Developers platform. This App ID is required to integrate your application with various Facebook functions, such as logging in through Facebook, accessing Facebook’s Graph API, or incorporating social plugins like the Like button.
SeeAccess to your Facebook Application IDfor instructions on how to find your application ID.
While you may see your forwarded mParticle audiences listed in Facebook Ads right away, it can take up to 24 hours before your audience data begins to fully populate. This time can vary depending on how large your audiences are.
After logging into Facebook Ads Manager, make sure that you select the correct Business Portfolio from the left-hand navbar. You should select the Business Portfolio containing the Ads Account you chose to forward your audiences to.
When you select more than one user identity to forward to Facebook, a separate audience will be created in Facebook for each identity you select. If you want to have a single audience containing all of the identities you selected, make sure that you checkEnable Multi-Key Audienceswhen connecting your audience to Facebook.
However, even with multi-key audiences enabled, you will still see an additional audience in Facebook for each identity selected.

Snap is a camera company whose flagship application Snapchat, the Spectacles product, and a variety of publisher tools provide brands a unique platform to reach targeted audience segments with engaging and personalized content.
In order to enable the mParticle integration with Snapchat you will need the account credentials for a Snapchat account.  The integration activation process will prompt you to log into your Snapchat account, and once logged in, mParticle will automatically retrieve the credentials that it needs to forward audience data to Snapchat. If you intend to use the optional Value Based Audience feature, you will need to request Snap to enable the feature for your ad account and ensure they complete such request before you create a Value Based Audience connection in mParticle.


When forwarding audience data to Snapchat, mParticle will send SHA-256 hash of the following identities based on the values of the Connection Settings:
The Snapchat Audience Integration uses Bulk Forwarding. Bulk Forwarding means that, instead of uploading updates to an audience in real time, mParticle compiles updates into a queue until either a given amount of time has passed since the last upload, or until a certain number of updates are waiting to be sent.
By default, mParticle uploads to Snapchat whenever at least one of the following conditions is met:
Upload frequency can sometimes be adjusted. Reach out to your mParticle Customer Success Manager if you need to discuss upload frequency.
When you delete a connection or audience, the downstream segment in Snap will be deleted.
You can use the mParticle audience integration to create value-based audiences with Snap. As a prerequisite, Snap must enable value-based audience support for your ad account.
By default, mParticle will forward all users in a value-based audience to Snap even if their user attribute representing value is missing or negative. You can exclude users with negative, missing, and zero values by unchecking theAllow Zero And Negative Valuesconnection setting when creating your value-based audience.

mParticle’s Twitter Tailored Audience integration enables app owners to push audiences created in Audience Manager to Twitter. Once the integration is activated and your audience is pushed to Twitter, you can then target Promoted Tweets to your Tailored Audiences for engagement, cross-promotion, exclusion targeting or monetization use cases.
In order to enable audience forwarding to Twitter, you will need the account credentials for a Twitter account that is linked to your app’s Twitter Ads account.  The integration activation process in Audience Manager will prompt you to log into your Twitter account, and once authorized, mParticle will automatically retrieve the credentials that it needs to forward audiences to Twitter. The account you login with will need a permission level of Account Administrator to connect an affiliated Ad Account.
Depending on the Configuration Settings that you select (see below), Twitter will use one or more of the following IDs to match users:
mParticle sends these IDs as a SHA-256 hash.
mParticle deletes the downstream audience when you delete an audience from mParticle.
For more information about advertising through Twitter, seeTwitter Business.

Brazeis a comprehensive customer engagement platform that powers relevant experiences between consumers and brands they love. Braze helps brands foster human connection through interactive conversations across channels.
mParticle audiences correspond to Braze’sSegmentsfeature and can be used to target engagement campaigns in Braze.
In order to activate our Braze integration, you’re going to need theAPI keyfor each app that you’d like to set up, which can be found by logging into your Braze account and navigating to your app’s settings. You will also need to create anApp Group REST API Keyin the Developer Console.
Braze maintains several instances. As part of theConfiguration Settings, you need to specify which one your data should be forwarded to.  You can tell yourBraze Instancefrom the URL of your Braze Dashboard.
Check with your Braze account manager if you are unsure which Braze instance you are using.
There is also the ability to specify a Custom instance, which allows you to specify separate endpoints for REST, SDK and Javascript.
Usinghttps://or a trailing/in your endpoint address will cause errors.
mParticle will attempt to match users in Braze based on IDFAs, Android Device IDs, and a customizableExternal User ID field, which uniquely identifies a user in Braze. You can set which Identity Type to use as the External User ID in theConfiguration Settings. Your External User ID should be a unique, permanent identifier — usually Customer ID or Email. If you are also using theEventintegration, make sure you set the same External User ID across both integrations.
The Braze API does not allow mParticle to directly create and maintain membership of segments in Braze, so the Audience integration works by setting attributes on a user, which you can then use todefine a corresponding segment in Braze. Like mParticle, Braze populates it’s Segment Manager based on the actual data points received, so you need to create audiences in mParticle and connect them to Braze first. Then, provided your audience is not empty, the segment membership attributes should become available in the Braze Segment Manager within a few minutes.
mParticle offers seven ways to set segment membership attributes, controlled by theSend Segments AsConfiguration Setting. The drop-down has the following options:
These options will be explained in further detail below.
Note that Audience IDs can be found in the main Audience list view.

For example, note the Audience IDs for these three audiences:
This is the default behavior.  mParticle creates a single custom attribute in Braze for each user, calledSegmentMembership. The value of this attribute is a comma-separated string of mParticle audience IDs that match the user.
Using the above examples, a user who is a member ofTest Audience 1,Test Audience 2, andTest Audience 3will show the attributeSegmentMembershipwith a value of"'13053','13052', '13051'"in Braze.
See theSample Braze Profilefor an example.
To target members ofTest Audience 1, for example, you need to create a matching segment in Braze using the mParticle Audience ID,
with the filterSegmentMembership—matches regex—13051. It’s important to choose thematches regexoption, and notequals, or users with membership in more than one audience will not be matched.

mParticle creates a single custom array attribute in Braze for each user, calledSegmentMembershipArray. The value of this attribute is an array of mParticle audience IDs that match the user.
Using the above examples, a user who is a member ofTest Audience 1,Test Audience 2, andTest Audience 3will show the attributeSegmentMembershipArraywith a value of["13053","13052", "13051"]in Braze. Note, however, that Braze parses array attributes to make them more readable.
See theSample Braze Profilefor an example.
To target members ofTest Audience 1, for example, you need to create a matching segment in Braze with the filterSegmentMembershipArray—includes value—13051

mParticle creates a custom attribute in Braze for each audience that a user belongs to, based on the External Name of the audience.
Using the above examples, a user who is a member of audienceTest Audience 1will show the attributeIn Test Audience 1istruein Braze.
To target members ofTest Audience 1, for example, you need to create a matching segment in Braze with the filterIn Test Audience 1—equals—true.

mParticle will send attributes as described by bothSingle Array AttributeandSingle String Attribute.
mParticle will send attributes as described by bothSingle Array AttributeandOne Attribute Per Segment.
mParticle will send attributes as described by bothSingle String AttributeandOne Attribute Per Segment.
mParticle will send attributes as described bySingle Array Attribute,Single String AttributeandOne Attribute Per Segment.
Here is a sample Braze profile with all options enabled.
Since mParticle does not directly maintain segments in Braze, it will not delete segments when the corresponding mParticle audience connection is deleted or deactivated. When this happens, mParticle willnotupdate the audience user attributes in Braze to remove the audience from each user.
Deleting an audience does not remove the custom attributes in Braze.

Pinterest - Reach people who are using Pinterest to discover and plan the things they want to do in the future.  Using the Ads API, businesses on Pinterest manage, scale and optimize their Promoted Pins.
In order to enable mParticle’s integration with Pinterest, you need to have abusiness accountwith Pinterest, and the account credentials for the Pinterest account.  The integration activation process in Audience Manager will prompt you to log into your Pinterest account, and once authorized, mParticle will automatically retrieve the credentials that it needs to forward audiences to Pinterest.
If you are not working with a Pinterest Marketing Developer Partner, contactadvertiser-data-onboarders@pinterest.comand CC your Pinterest account team requesting access to the Pinterest API.
When forwarding audience data to Pinterest, mParticle will send SHA-1 hash of IDFAs, Google Advertising IDs and Emails based on the values of the Connection Settings.
The Pinterest Audience Integration uses Bulk Forwarding. Bulk Forwarding means that, instead of uploading updates to an audience in real time, mParticle compiles updates into a queue until either a given amount of time has passed since the last upload, or until a certain number of updates are waiting to be sent.
By default, mParticle uploads to Pinterest whenever at least one of the following conditions is met:
Upload frequency can sometimes be adjusted. Reach out to your mParticle Customer Success Manager if you need to discuss upload frequency.
mParticle doesn’t delete the downstream audience when you delete an audience in mParticle.
