Paragraphs:
In the Web SDK, Lytics provides a tag that can be placed on your site to collect behavioral data and surface the materialized profile back to your browser in real time. Manual installation instructions are available from within the app atData Pipeline>SDK>Web SDK.
If your site is aDrupalorWordpresssite, or you useGoogle Tag Managerwe recommend using one of these turnkey methods to install the Lytics Tag:
Visit theConfigurationpage either from the module details in theExtendsection of Drupal or directly from theConfigurationsection (/en/admin/config/system/lytics).
Add a valid API Token for your Lytics account. Be sure to give that tokenadminprivileges, as that will unlock account verification and direct access to all Lytics systems responsible for surfacing and managing profiles and personalization. This token should also have no expiration, as it will need continued access to your Lytics account. For more information visit ourAccess Token documentation.
With your token entered. Ensure theEnable Tabsetting is selected. This will automatically place the Lytics JavaScript SDK onto all public pages of your site.
Uponsaving configuration, your account details will be surfaced. Be sure to verify that your token is for the Lytics account you are currently configuring.
That's it!
Once the tag has been installed, validate a successful installation via one of the three following methods:
The Lytics Dev Tools Chrome Extension makes validation and exploration simple. Once you've installed the extension as outlined above:
Open the extension and ensure it has been activated.
The interface will display a message to confirm the correct installation of the Lytics tag and relevant configuration details.
We've built a simple tool to validate that data flows into your Lytics account. Please note that the collected events may take a few minutes to reflect in the UI.
If you prefer to verify the installation manually, you can do so by opening the Chrome developer console and ensuringjstagis accessible. In addition, by viewing the network tab, you can monitor data collection requests being sent tolytics.io/cand personalization requests being loaded fromlytics.io/api/personalize
The final step to verify installation is ensuring you can access your visitor profile. This profile is built and delivered in real-time as you engage with content.
The Lytics Dev Tools Chrome Extension makes validation and exploration simple. Once you've installed the extension as outlined above:
Open the extension and ensure it has been activated.
AccessProfilefrom the bottom menu in the Chrome extension.
This section of the extension profiles two views into your profile.
The first is theSummaryshowcasing available attributes and affinities.
The second is theDetails, which profiles a raw JSON dump of all available attributes and insights accessible via the Personalization Engine web SDK.

Lytics' Interest Engines effectively analyze your content with minimal effort required. However, to guarantee that the classification results align with your expectations, conducting a quick test is advisable, as poor metadata can sometimes lead to less-than-optimal outcomes. The most reliable method to ensure comprehensive and satisfactory content classification is to classify a selection of your URLs manually.

Building Profiles
Crawling: https://docs.lytics.com/docs/developer-attributes
Paragraphs:
Lytics offers a wide range of pre-packaged user attributes, including automatically generated and customizable ones. Additionally, Lytics employs predictive modeling and machine learning algorithms to provide insights and scores, allowing users to gain a deeper understanding of their audience. The guide below provides an overview of all available attributes and examples to enhance your profiling efforts.
If you haven't already reviewed ourdocumentation on collecting eventsvia our JavaScript SDK, we highly recommend doing so first. This will give you a better understanding of how data collection works at a high level before delving into the specifics of what can be collected.
The following attributes are all available out of the box with no customization necessary in all Lytics pricing tiers. Do note that any attributes flagged asComputedcan not be edited directly but are computed based on various factors, including other non-computed attributes.
For a more comprehensive example of how any of the following attributes can be collected and used for your visitors click thenameof the identifier to access the code examples below.
Default attributes that are used to stitch profiles together. For instance, if you pass anemailalong with the_uid, all events that have only been associated with either identifier will be merged into a single comprehensive profile.
Details encompass all default attributes related to user demographics and general information, including name, phone number, status, etc. It serves as a catch-all for attributes not specifically tied to interactions or behaviors.
Meta encompasses all system-level information that provides insights into the health and breadth of the profile. This includes data such as creation date, last update timestamp, source information, and other metadata associated with the profile's management and maintenance. Metadata offers a behind-the-scenes view of the profile's overall status and administration.
Behavioral attributes typically cannot be directly managed but represent a set of insights derived from a user's behavior over time. These insights are invaluable when personalizing experiences based on changes in behavior or behaviors indicative of high likelihood. For instance, you might want to present a premium offer to users exhibiting higher momentum than usual. Behavioral attributes enable targeted and timely interventions tailored to user actions and patterns.
Interests entail understanding the topics a user is interested in based on their interactions, cross-referenced by deep programmatic analysis of their online activities. This allows for tailored content recommendations and targeted messaging aligned with the user's preferences and engagement history.
Attributes classified as intelligence encompass diverse, highly valuable information to facilitate relevant and high-value personalized experiences. Within this category, you'll discover real-time segment membership, values crucial for split testing and experimentation, and direct correlation to our real-time machine learning modeling. These attributes empower dynamic and data-driven decision-making, enhancing the efficacy of personalized marketing strategies.
Activity encompasses the user's engagement across different channels and campaigns, including clicks and conversions. It provides valuable insights into recent interactions, aiding campaign optimization and channel effectiveness assessment.
This is an automatically generated canonical ID managed by Lytics. It refers to the materialized profile and cannot be customized or overridden.
_uid represents the Lytics anonymous 1st party cookie. This value is automatically captured with everyjstag.send()call from the JavaScript tag. The only way to customize this value is to explicitly set the value of _uid, which we do not recommend.
By default, the Lytics JavaScript SDK will collect language information based on the browser, but this can be overridden.
Lytics automatically generate this and represents the oldest event associated with the user.
This is automatically generated by Lytics and represents the last time the user was modified.
This is automatically generated by Lytics and represents the last time the users scores were updated.
This is automatically generated by Lytics and represents the number of aliases associated with the user.

This is automatically generated by Lytics and represents the number of streams associated with the user.
This is automatically generated by Lytics and represents the names of the streams associated with the user.
This is automatically generated by Lytics and represents whether the user has been flagged as a bot or not.
The following attributes are all computed in real-time as the profile evolves. Each of the behavioral attributes are surfaced as a score between 0 and 100. These scores represent an aggregate summary of the user's behavior across various dimensions: Consistency, Frequency, Intensity, Maturity, Momentum, Propensity, Quantity, Recency, and Volatility.
The interest attributes are computed in real-time and represent the user's interest in various topics. These topics are generated as a result of the analysis done by the Lytics Interest Engine and then associated with the user based upon their interaction with content on your site.
This attribute displays an array of all segments the user is currently a member of. It updates in real-time based on various audience definitions. Lytics offers a range of useful segments out of the box, requiring no additional setup. For detailed information on these audiences, refer to our Developer Tier > Audiences documentation.
These attributes are automatically generated by Lytics and represent a random value evenly distributed across users. They are useful for split testing and experimentation.
This attribute is computed in real-time and represents the relative distance between now and the next predicted event. It is stream specific and is useful for understanding when a user is likely to engage again.
This attribute is computed in real-time and represents the next expected event. It is stream specific and is useful for understanding when a user is likely to engage again.
This attribute is computed in real-time and represents the scores resulting from Lytics Lookalike and SegmentML models. Out-of-the-box, Lytics offers a range of useful models, requiring no additional setup. For detailed information on these models, refer to our Developer Tier > Models documentation.
Both of these attributes are automatically populated based upon the_evalue in thejstag.sendpayload. By default Lytics will collect apvevent for each page view and this will automatically populate thefirst_seenandlast_seenattributes. Below is an example of collecting a custom event that would populate these attributes as well.

Crawling: https://docs.lytics.com/docs/lead-capture
Paragraphs:
This document outlines how to leverage Lytics' real-time personalization engine to identify visitors who lack the strong identifiers necessary to link web-based behavioral insights with other activation channels such as email.
Traditionally, lead capture involves gathering information from individuals interested in your products or services, such as names, email addresses, and phone numbers. This occurs when people visit your website, subscribe to your newsletter, download resources, or interact with your content. However, in recent years, the role of lead capture within your global consumer engagement strategy has undergone significant transformation.
Lytics' real-time personalization engine lets you first identify the current web visitor, programmatically review their profile, and ultimately decide if a campaign should be delivered to their browser to close gaps in that profile.

Below, you'll find a detailed guide on how to execute this use case. At the end, you'll find additional reading, which will help you learn how to extend and customize this use case further.
Before executing this use case, your website must be properly configured with the core Lytics SDK (JavaScript tag). Please refer to ourinstallation documentationto confirm the tag is present before continuing.
As an admin user of Lytics, you canenable or disable any attributesfrom being surfaced to the web via our JavaScript SDK. Depending on how your account has been configured, you may need to allow some of the required attributes for this particular use case.
Required Attributes:
To execute this use case, we will launch a simple lead capture form at the bottom left of your site. The lead capture will focus on collecting email addresses for the user and use a generic "dark" theme along with some boilerplate messaging. For best results, we recommend leveraging an offer of some sort that will resonate with your customers to entice them to "sign up" and identify themselves. In return, you'll gain much knowledge about this visitor, strengthen your consumer record, and unlock the ability to connect in channels outside of just the web.
You can extend this use case to progressively improve your visitor profiles by surfacing data capture forms specific to gaps in their profile data. For instance, when they are unknown, only ask for email. As soon as you have an email, perhaps you want to know more about their preferences or learn how to improve a particular portion of your product/offering.
The Lytics platform has a pre-defined schema to facilitate this use case. As such, we recommend building acustom reportfrom within our UI to showcase your progress in converting unknown or anonymous visitors to known visitors with a strong identifier. There are many ways to configure this type of reporting, but here we'll guide you through a basic example to measure impact.

Step 1:Once you have created your new report, add a component using the "+ Add New Component" button at the top of the report.
Step 2:Select "Size" as your component type.
Step 3:Name your component. We recommend something simple like "Anonymous vs. Known".
Step 4:Add an optional description to explain the goal of this report to ease the consumption for others later.
Step 5:Select the audiences you'd like to highlight. In this use case, we'll select "Anonymous Profiles" and "Known Profiles", which are both available by default.
Step 6:Save your component. Please note it may take some time for the report to populate once you have configured it, but as long as you see the empty "Not enough data" state, you are good to go.
Step 1:Following steps similar to the previous component, we'll add another component, but this time, we use the "Composition" component type.
Step 2:Name your component "Campaign Impressions," as this component will focus on showcasing impression information to validate that the campaign is being shown.
Step 3:Select the "All" audience to ensure all visitors, regardless if they are known or unknown, are included in the report.
Step 4:Select the field "ly_impressions." This field represents an array of all campaigns each visitor has interacted with and is available by default. The values returned for custom campaigns will match the "ID" you set above in the campaign configuration.
Step 5:Finally, replace "my_campaign_id" in the example below with the ID of your campaign above to highlight only interactions for that campaign.
Following the same steps as above, configure another "Composition" component, but this time, use the field "ly_conversions" as it will be an array of all campaigns your users have converted on instead of the impressions used previously.
Thats it. Your report has been configured. As you begin to gain impressions and conversions, this report will populate. Generally, every hour or two, to highlight the impact.
Get additional guidance on how to pass interaction information related to your campaign to the following common sources for additional reporting and insight discovery:
Once you have configured and tested your Experience, activation is as simple as publishing the JavaScript code to your site. This may be done via a tag manager like Google Tag Manager or using another mechanism such as Drupal blocks or WordPress.

Paragraphs:
This document details the process of utilizing Lytics' real-time personalization engine to showcase content that resonates with a visitor's interests. This can be implemented directly inline or through a pop-up modal on your website to boost engagement.
Lytics Interest Engines provides a sophisticated approach for businesses to gain and leverage insights into which content is most likely to resonate based on behavioral patterns. This is achieved through a detailed enrichment and affinity generation process in real-time. While full details are available in Lytics' comprehensive documentation, the core process can be distilled into four key steps:
This streamlined framework enables real-time personalization, enhancing user experience by continuously adapting to evolving visitor interests.
Relevant content for individual users boosts marketing effectiveness and ROI by increasing engagement and conversion rates. Personalized content meets users' interests, leading to better resource utilization and higher customer retention. This targeted strategy enhances sales opportunities and brand perception, directly improving return on investment.
Lytics' real-time personalization engine lets you first identify the current web visitor, programmatically review their profile, and deliver one or more pieces of content based on their unique interests to maximize engagement.
Below, you'll find a detailed guide on how to execute this use case. At the end, you'll find additional reading, which will help you learn how to extend and customize this use case further.
Before executing this use case, your website must be properly configured with the core Lytics SDK (JavaScript tag). Please refer to ourinstallation documentationto confirm the tag is present before continuing.
Your content must be classified before Lytics can offer content recommendations or insights. Typically, this classification process takes 24 to 48 hours, though it may extend if your catalog is particularly large. To ensure the health of your content graph and interest engines, there are a few key areas to focus on:
If you have not already verified the quality of classification and metadata, please refer to ourquickstart documentation.
From the Lytics interface, navigate toDecision Enginefrom the product switcher at the top left.
Using the left-hand menu, navigate toContent>Collections.
From the list of collections, there is likely only one; look forAll Contentin the list and the rowsSize. This refers to the number of documents classified; it should be greater than one and reflect your total catalog.
For greater detail, you can also visitContent>Web Classification.
At the top of that page will be a summary dashboard of all content that has been successfully classified and cataloged. Most notably, theAll Documentscount under theURL Pathcomponent.
We will use the default collection outlined below for this exercise, but you may also create a custom collection with a subset of your content to recommend.
Ready to go a step farther and build a custom collection of your content to ensure recommendations are selected from a more currated set of documents? Check out our fulldocumentation.
As an admin user of Lytics, you canenable or disable any attributesfrom being surfaced to the web via our JavaScript SDK. Depending on how your account has been configured, you may need to allow some of the required attributes for this particular use case.
Required Attributes:
To execute this use case, we will demonstrate two examples. The first will be a single content recommendation in a popup style modal, while the second will leverage Pathfora to add a set of recommendations inline to your website.

In this example, we'll use a generic Drupal Block with pure HTML and CSS, but the same approach can be taken using WordPress or a third-party tag manager such as Google Tag Manager.

Paragraphs:
Vault is a centralized hub for managing security and other administrative features in Lytics. It provides a single place for Lytics admins to access and change their key security features and user permissions, regardless of product. This means that the controls set in Vault apply to Conductor, Decision Engine, Cloud Connect, and any other products associated with your Lytics account.
Take a quick tour of Lytics Vault.
Vault is comprised of the following sections:
Vault is focused primarily on account admins or those that have permission to administer settings, user access, etc. Based upon these permissions, your experience in Vault may vary, and all sections outlined above may not be available.
If you are unable to access a section please reach out to your account administrator to request those adjusted permissions.
In general, Admins will be able to access all areas. Data Managers, Campaign Managers, Experience Managers, and Goal Managers can access the Authorizations section to manage the credentials for their jobs and experiences. Finally, all Lytics users, regardless of role, should have access to view the JavaScript tag installation page under Account Setup, and they should be able to view their user profile where they can change details such as their Name, Email Address, Phone Number (for two-factor authentication) and change their password. Your user profile will be accessible under the main Lytics navigation under "Manage My Profile."
For existing customers, slight changes will impact your day-to-day management activities.
Vault will be available directly from the primary product switcher at the top left of your Lytics interface. This will be your primary access point for account management from now on.
Our account usage data and quota meters received a much-needed facelift. The usage metrics act as the Vault "dashboard" for admin users.

Account setting sections are now accessible through the main navigation. These settings have received a minor facelift update. The form controls for multi-text fields have been slightly updated for a more standard user experience. In addition, users are now prompted to save or discard their changes when navigating away from these pages with unsaved settings.
The user list is now sortable and filterable based on name, email, who invited them, and how long they've been a Lytics user. Each user has a page to view their details and roles. In Vault, in addition to assigning new roles, an administrator can edit any user's name and email address.

The user invite form is now on its page to improve the flow and experience of inviting users. Roles are now sorted into two categories - Admin or Custom Roles. An admin inherently has access to everything, while custom roles give a finer-grain definition of what the user can access. The details on each role are shown in a tooltip when you hover over the role name.

The access tokens list is now sortable and filterable based on the name, description, the creator of the token, or when/if it has expired. You can now view additional details about the access tokens you've already created, such as the roles assigned, when it was made, and when it will expire. In addition, new access tokens can now be assigned as an admin or with any combination of more granular access roles.

Authorizations are now to be created and updated only in Vault. You will still be able to utilize the auths you create in Vault in other products, but for example, when creating a job in Conductor or Decision Engine, if you don't see an authorization you want to use for that job, you will be linked into the authorizations wizard within Vault to create the auth.

Paragraphs:
In Lytics, audit logs and system alerts originate from a shared source:Lytics System Events. A System Event is simply a log of an action taken within the platform, whether it’s a user creating a job, segment, or role, or an error message indicating a job failure.
In both cases, the content of exports or alerts depends on the filters you set up. Filtering is typically done using theSubject(such as User, Segment, or Job) and theVerb(the action taken on the subject, like created, updated, deleted, or failed).
Creating a job to export your Audit and System Event logs is like creating any other job; for more information, seeData Pipeline-> Jobs.    In theFilterspanel, simply selectAudit Logsto create an export of your Audit logs or System Events.
Depending on yourProvider, you can then select to exportSystem Events.
For example, if you selectedGoogle Cloudand you want to export the events toBigQuery.
Then, you'd want to select theBigQuery: Export System EventsJob-Type tile.   After choosing the Job-Type, it's like configuring any other export job.  In the case of BigQuery, you can do a one-time or continuous export.
Creating a job to alert on an Audit and System Event logs is like creating any other job; for more information, seeData Pipeline-> Jobs.    In theFilterspanel, simply selectAudit Logsto create an export of your Audit logs or System Events.
Depending on yourProvider, you can then select to exportSystem EventsorEmail Alerts.
For example, if you select to get an email when an Alert is triggered, then useLyticsas your provider and selectEmail Alerts.
Then configure whatSubjectyou wanted to listen too and whatEvent Types (aka Verbs).

Audit logs can be filtered by
Job-status events can be observed by creating a webhook subscription that POSTs data (or JSON) to a specific URL. These updates, like email alerting and reporting, can be consumed downstream for your monitoring use cases.  Some common examples include listening for audience exports created/updated/deleted or being notified whenever a batch import or export for a given integration fails.
For events related to the subject typework, the followingverbsmay be emitted:
Lytics provides a webhook integration that allows you to monitor and react to system events in real-time. This integration enables you to build automated workflows, trigger external actions, and maintain synchronization with your other systems based on events occurring within Lytics.
The following example shows how to subscribe to multiple event types and send them to a webhook endpoint:
You can integrate Lytics system events with Slack using a custom JSON template. This example shows how to send failure notifications to a Slack channel:
You can filter events by source type and ID using thesystem_event_sourcesconfiguration:
To receive events for all works in your account, use an empty array.

Paragraphs:
Lytics provides a variety of valuable metrics that downstream monitoring tools, such as Google Stackdriver or New Relic, can consume. Using industry-standard, inexpensive tools built for alerting and monitoring, you can have visibility into Lytics within your existing ecosystem.
Once you have connected Lytics to your monitoring tool, there are various ways you can apply metrics from Lytics to support your operational and IT audit processes. Below are a few examples:
The Metric API provides access to a variety of metrics that are recorded in the Lytics platform. This API allows you to access segment size metrics, events received per hour, and many workflow-specific metrics.
*Availability of Metrics: the Lytics Metric API and all Lytics export workflows run inside Lytics' work runtime system in Kubernetes. During deploys or scaling events, these processes can move between servers, potentially resulting in 1 or 2-minute gaps in metrics. Therefore, alerts on single heartbeat misses are not recommended. Instead, look for a missing window of 5.

Paragraphs:
The Account Usage section shows how many inbound and outbound events Lytics has received for your account. If your account has an inbound event quota, you will find a meter displaying how much of your inbound event quota you have used for each quota period.
In the Lytics UI, selectVaultfrom the product switcher. Or, if you are already in Vault, selectUsagefrom the main menu.
This view offers a quick way to gauge the quantity of data Lytics has received from your various Sources. Of course, if you would like to explore details for incoming data further you can view more granular details of all connected Sources from theConductorinterface.
Aninbound eventis a record of activity collected or uploaded to Lytics from a customer data source, such as a record of user web activity, email opening, or an update to a subscriber record. The inbound events graph shows your total inbound events, which can be displayed daily, weekly, or monthly.
The inbound quota meter displays the number of events recorded in the quota period, your quota limit, and the meter to gauge your usage versus your quota limit quickly. For monthly term accounts, quota periods begin on the first of each month and end on the last day of the month. For annual term accounts, quota periods begin at the start of your Lytics subscription. Quotas (unless otherwise stated in your contract) only count for production accounts.
Automated alerts for Inbound Event Quotas can be configured to sent toMicrosoft Teams,Slack, or directly to anemail address.
Anoutbound eventis any record of data exported from Lytics, whether manually or automatically. The outbound events graph shows your total outbound events, which can be displayed daily, weekly, or monthly.

Changing a password will immediately invalidate all current sessions across all machines for the user.
Click "Manage Users" in the account menu to manage account users.
User roles define the amount of access and permissions a Lytics user has when logged in and through theLytics APIs.
A user may have any number of these roles, and the permissions for multiple roles are additive. For example, a user with the Campaign Manager and Content Manager roles will have access to all permissions granted by both roles.
Users with the Admin role can control other users' roles within your organization via the "Manage Users" option from the account dropdown menu.
You can indicate any user fields in your account that contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII) via the private fields account setting. These fields will be hidden for anyone who does not have Admin, Data Manager, or User Search roles. You should verify withLytics Supportthat the field hiding in the segment scan is also enabled for your account to ensure these fields are hidden there.
A user's role determines which parts of the Lytics app they can access. Here is a breakdown of what is shown in the navigation for each role.
For access to look-a-like models you will need to be an accountadminor have a combination ofDiscovery Insight+ a role that gives access toJobs/Auths.
Roles define a set of permissions the user has, which also dictates what actions they can take in the app and through the APIs. Here is a breakdown of the permissions for each role by feature.
To shield PI from users who should not have access, you will need to use the private fields account setting to mark the profile fields you want to hide from anyone who does not have Admin, Data Manager, or User Search roles.
The former "Integrations" tab is now comprised of the "Jobs" and "Authorizations" sections, which allow you to manage your import and exports.
All roles have API read access to topic rollups, segment collections, and SegmentML. Marked below are the roles with full CRUD access to these features.
Click theCreate Newbutton from the user list to invite a new user to the account.
Inviting a new user will prompt for an email address and roles to select the appropriate level of access the user will have within your Lytics account. Upon completing this form, the new user will get an email with a link that will take them to the Lytics account login screen.
From the user list, select the user you wish to delete. You can remove this user from Lytics by clicking theDelete Userbutton from their profile page.

Paragraphs:
Lytics supports Single Sign-On (SSO) by using Google Cloud Identity Platform as a service provider using SAML protocol. Lytics integrates with Identity Providers (IdPs) in such a way that the Service Provider (SP) initiates SSO.IDP-initiated SSO has been deprecated and is no longer supported by Lytics.
Single Sign-On (SSO) allows employees to safely and securely access a host of Internet tools with a single username and password. There are four primary reasons why your business should consider leveraging Single Sign-On:
SSO helps the end user.Implementing SSO means employees are required to commit just one password to memory. With one password to remember, a user can easily create and remember a unique and secure password without writing it down. SSO reduces password fatigue and frustration and makes the employee more efficient.
SSO benefits the company.Fewer passwords to remember equals fewer calls to the helpdesk, resulting in more time spent on other tasks for both the end user and IT. Fewer calls to the helpdesk (which is oftentimes outsourced) means a reduction in cost to the company as well.
SSO improves security.When employees are required to remember numerous passwords, it is easy to fall into lazy habits, such as using simple, easy-to-remember passwords, which are more susceptible to hacking. Or writing passwords down on Post-it notes where they can easily be stolen or fall into the wrong hands.
SSO helps with compliance.SSO helps companies increase control over the user's access to certain information as well as easily enforce password change policies. This makes it simpler for organizations to comply with HIPAA, SOX, and other regulatory groups.
Lytics supports enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) by usingGoogle Cloud Identity Platformas a service provider usingSAML protocol. Lytics integrates with Identity Providers (IdPs) in such a way that the Service Provider (SP) initiates SSO.
Once implemented, users will log in to Lytics via aspecial SSO formthat only requires an email address. Lytics will recognize the email address and open a pop-up to the user's IdP to complete the login. Once the IdP verifies credentials, the pop-up will close, redirecting the user to a logged-in instance of their Lytics dashboard. Behind the scenes, a customer's IdP will communicate with the Lytics APIs, which useGoogle Cloud Identity Platformto validate the login. This document describes the process for integrating with a new IdP that uses SAML.
To configure SAML for the Lytics service provider, some information is required about your IdP. If you have a metadata file that contains SAML provider information, this may be appropriate, but please ensure that the following information is provided toLytics Support:
Further configuration details, such as mappings, may need to be provided, but the Lytics implementation only requires the email address field to be mapped. Once this information has been received, Lytics can configure the SAML connection in the Google Cloud Identity Platform.
After Lytics configures the SAML connection on the service provider,Lytics Supportwill provide the following key fields of information to the customer to complete the configuration in their IdP.
With this information, your IdP connection can be configured to complete the SSO integration.
At this time, Lytics does not support providing this information in an XML metadata file. Additional information about the Service Provider may be provided on request.
Once all the information has been configured in both the IdP and the Lytics service provider, you can test and verify that the SSO implementation works as expected. If you are using SSO as your only sign-in method, please disable any password restriction or expiration settings that may have been enabled in the UI.
During the testing process, Lytics can be configured to allow both SSO login and regular username and password (or Google OAuth) login through the app. This allows users to test SSO without disrupting the day-to-day usage of the app.
If requested, once the SSO implementation has been tested and verified, Lytics can disable the use of other login types for an account.
If it's known that SSO will be added to an account, the user email addresses added to the account should match the email address present within the IdP. If the email address doesn’t match, the login will fail as Lytics will not be able to verify that there is a user with that email address.
For instance, if the email listed in the IdP isabc@123and within Lytics, it isdef@456, then there will be potentially multiple error points for a user trying to log in via the SSO form on Lytics.
If the user entersabc@123into the IdP pop-up, it will immediately fail as we use the Lytics account user to determine which IdP to redirect to. You would see an error message like the following:

However, should the user enterdef@456(their Lytics account email), they will be redirected to their IdP, but the verification of the login will fail once information is sent back to Lytics.
To remedy this situation, you would need to create a new user within Lytics with the email addressabc@123for the SSO login to be successful.  You can check, add, and remove users for an account using theManaging Usersguide as a reference.
Lytics Supportcan assist in the troubleshooting process. When testing for the first time, Lytics can enable logging to help troubleshoot any issues you encounter. With this, the team can help debug if you provide information on the login attempt, such as the login time, user, and account.
If you’re encountering a verification error, but you've checked that your emails from the IdP and Lytics match, this may be an issue with the SAML configuration either on the IdP or SP side. ContactLytics Supportwith details of the issue, and our team can coordinate a fix.
It should also be noted that primary accounts (master accounts) are decided as the first account that a user was added to.  Due to this,  users from a single group/organization will often have different primary accounts. This is important for SSO as it will also be the account the user is logged into at the start of their session. If SSO is enabled as the only means of login on one account and a user attempts to log in using Google OAuth or their username and password, the login session will fail. The following options are possible solutions:
Configuring Role Assertions for SSO in Lytics
The Lytics team can configure Single Sign-On (SSO) to assign roles via SSO. This configuration must be applied to the primary (master) accounts and any additional accounts to which users need access. For more information, refer to theaccount structure with SSO.
Important Note:Users cannot be assigned to additional accounts via SSO alone; they must be manually invited to each Lytics account to which they need access.
To set up role assignments via SSO, customers must configure their Identity Provider (IDP) to include a group assertion for each account the user can access. The role of each user must be specified in the format:lytics_<AID>_<Role>
Example of a SAML assertion for a user whose default account is 123 and also has access to account 234:
Note: This example is simplified to focus only on the group's assertion; a real-world example would be more detailed.
The following roles can be assigned:

Two-factor authentication is a technique that helps to make your account more secure. It does this by adding a second step to your login process.
Single-factor authentication uses your email address and password to authenticate your Lytics session.
The second factor comes from the Authy app using an Authy SoftToken, a secret token that changes every 20 seconds. Entering a correct token provides an extra level of verification.
An Authy SoftToken is a secret token that is broadcast to the Authy app every 20 seconds. This unique token serves as a second factor by which Lytics can authenticate your session. Authy is available to download for free as a desktop and mobile app:Download Authy.
The only difference between two-factor authentication and single-factor authentication is an extra step during login. After providing your password, you will then be asked for your Authy SoftToken.
Using Two-Factor Authentication also requires every user to provide their phone number. Logging in with two-factor authentication for the first time will walk a user through this workflow.

Determine third-party data sources:You can see the third-party data sources from which you send data to Lytics using the Lytics UI by navigating toData>Data Streams. The "default" stream will contain your web data unless otherwise configured. You will see your other integrations in the list of stream names using the drop-down menu at the top right. Each stream page will show you the last time Lytics received data.
Determine third-party data destinations:You can view the activity history for a data destination using the Lytics UI by navigating toData>Integrations. Click on the tile for the integration in question. If you're already running the integration, you will automatically be taken to the overview page that shows a list of running imports and exports and the history of events for those works.
Manage user consent and preference data.
Lytics customers are responsible for obtaining consent for collecting and transferring PII to Lytics for processing. You can use the Lytics JavaScript Tag to collect PII about customers' online behavior. One consent mechanism is to implement a custom tag and trigger in your Google Tag Manager account and assign that trigger to the Lytics JS tag. See how to manage consent with Google Tag Manager.
For sites not using Google Tag Manager, customer consent on the web can be managed in several ways. Consent triggers can be listened to by adding a snippet of custom JavaScript to your site. Another alternative is to use a cookie-consent solution, many of which exist. Github has documented afree solution, including demos. The Lytics JS Tag can be configured to consume triggers from any of these solutions to manage consent for your customers.
Recording Proof of Consent:Schema fields may be established for the purpose of storing customer consent.
Privacy Policy Notice:When you use a Lytics modal to collect user information, you should include a link to your organization’s privacy policy regarding the treatment of the PII collected. A link can be added to any modal created using the Experience Editor.
Age Gating:If you have collected accurate age data, you can build audiences that target or exclude certain ages.
Respond to the data subject (consumer) requests in compliance with regional and state privacy and data protection requirements.
Personal Data Access:Using thefind a userfeature, enter the identifying details provided by the consumer to locate their profile. The profile "created" date refers to the earliest date Lytics collected any data on this user.
Personal Data Correction:If user profile data requires correction, you must send the corrected data to Lytics, which will be remapped to convert the resulting user profile information.
Determining Categories of Personal Data Collected:You can use the Lytics UI to obtain information about the categories and specific pieces of PII collected on a consumer in the past 12 months. Again using the find a user feature, you can view the fields of populated data and determine the appropriate consumer PII categories to disclose to a requesting data subject/consumer.
Personal Data Portability:We support the export of profile information via the Lytics UI or APIs. An individual’s profile data from Lytics will be downloaded as a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file. JSON is a common, machine-readable file format.
Personal Data Deactivation/Suppression:You can establish audiences to enforce consumer suppression and “do not market” choices and prioritize those choices when establishing marketing journeys for your consumers. These audiences can be exported from Lytics to your downstream tools or "data destinations."
Personal Data Deletion:We provide a method for deleting users via the Lytics UI. Our API may also be used for this purpose. This will send a deletion request to the Lytics platform, which will process the request for the customer identifier provided.
An independent auditor has examined Lytics platform controls and confirmed they are in accordance with the Service Organization Controls (SOC) 2 Type II Trust Services Principles for Security, Availability, and Confidentiality. You can learn more about our SOC 2 Type II examination in thisblog post.
Lytics will continue to engage independent auditors to conduct SOC 2 Type II audits regularly and make our audit report available to our customers and prospects under an NDA. In addition, we retain independent security firms to conduct regular penetration tests and vulnerability scans on our systems and code, respectively. Our underlying cloud services provider, Google, also submits to regular, multiple independent audits, including SOC 2 Type II audits.
Lytics Data Protection Safeguards:Lytics and its data hosting partner, Google, have implemented numerous safeguards to protect the PII that Lytics processes on its customers' behalf. External auditors audit these safeguards on an annual basis. For more information regarding these safeguards, please ask your Lytics account manager.

Paragraphs:
Announcements about browsers changing their cookie tracking policies have created tremendous concern and confusion within marketing and advertising industries, and rightfully so. These changes represent dramatic shifts in how users and their activity are tracked across the web.
Browsers are removing third-party cookies and altering the default behavior of first-party cookies, which makes first-party data mission-critical for marketers more than ever before. The following explains how current and upcoming browser changes will impact your web tracking involving Lytics.
The blocking of third-party cookies, whether by browser default or user choice, will significantly impact the effectiveness, if not viability, of ad targeting, retargeting, attribution, and measurement efforts dependent on the use of third-party cookies. In addition, Apple’s ITP 2.2 impacts certain marketing use cases.
For Safari users, cookies get cleared after seven days if there is no activity. So if a user visits a site once and returns eight days later, their cookie will be gone. However, if that user returns every day for eight days, their cookie will remain intact.
This can skew analytics, impact personalization efforts for anonymous users, and affect conversion attribution. But put it in perspective, while Safari accounts for over half of mobile web traffic in the US for non-mobile and worldwide browser usage, Safari’s market share is around 20 percent as of January 2020.
More importantly, these browser changes continue the trend of giving individuals more control over what brands/entities they want to engage with and transparency in that regard. They point to the need for brands to maximize relevant content or offerings for a site visitor in real-time, which can lead to registration or other means of establishing a known, first-party relationship. These browser changes reflect the change from a model that exploits third-party data outside an established relationship to transparently establishing and cultivating a relationship with the consumer for mutual benefit.
The good news is Lytics was designed to help companies establish first-party relationships with their customers and implement intelligent identity resolution strategies. Lytics enables you to collect and leverage first-party data in various ways, such as: acquiring new customers, serving ads on-site with highly targeted audiences, and promoting relevant content to users based on their interests.
Onto the technical details. To understand how these browser changes will impact the Lytics JavaScript tag (aka Tracking Tag) you must first understand the core mechanics of how Lytics builds profiles for your anonymous visitors.
It all begins with Lytics’ unique client-side identifier, which is referred to as the UID or_uid. When a user visits your web property for the first time, the Lytics tag generates a unique value for this UID and stores it as a browser cookie. This UID is then appended to any behavioral data collected from their visit. Typically when a user returns after a subsequent visit, this UID persists since it has been stored as a cookie.
The impact of cookie changes on this process will vary by browser. In the case of Safari, for example, it means that if a user does not return within seven days, that particular identifier will be deleted. As such, it will become imperative to double down on your identity resolution strategies and ensure that efforts are being made to associate first-party anonymous cookies with other known identifiers that can persist, such as user IDs upon login.
In addition, some customers leverage theloadidparameter as part of their tag configuration. Historically, this has enabled a simple method for resolving identities across web properties. Thisloadidmethod relies on third-party cookies, which are impacted heavily by these cookie changes. Like the first-party implications above, cross-domain identity resolution strategies become more important.
To date, efforts have been made to rely less on browser cookies, given their uncertain nature. Version 3 of the Lytics JavaScript tag was built to be more secure and flexible**, allowing Lytics to respond to these types of changes more efficiently. At the end of the day, however, restricting or removing cookies, in general, will affect the way that you, the marketer, use and monitor the web. Focusing on safe, secure, and transparent resolution strategies is at the core of the Lytics platform, and we believe will allow any marketer to overcome these changes in the future.
Q. What cookies are issued in connection with the Lytics tag?
By default, Lytics sets a cookieseeridthat is used to identify a user. This is then surfaced in a users profile as_uid. Out of the box, this is what our JavaScript tag uses for web-based identity resolution.
Q. Are Lytics’ cookies first-party cookies or third-party cookies?
When issued by the client website domain on which they run, Lytics’ cookies are treated by browsers as first-party cookies. This is the case for all of our clients. In some cases, clients have established separate top-level domains for two or more of their brands. In these cases, many have leveraged an optional identity resolution aid that allows Lytics to store the same identifier as a third-party cookie. This allows for a hands-off approach to resolve identities across domains but in no way impacts the nature of our first-party cookies described above.
Lytics has enabled a “cookie culling” feature that prevents “stale” (old) cookies from being used as identifiers to stitch the user profile fragments. Given the browser cookie limits mentioned above, this ensures only valid identifiers will be used to build your Lytics user profiles, which helps keep them clean and consolidated.
For example, if a Safari user visits your site once and doesn’t return within two months, Lytics can remove this cookie from their first visit as it has become “stale.” There is no reason to keep this cookie as an identifier because it can’t be used for personalization. Lytics recommends opting for a maximum of 60 days to keep cookies, but this setting can be customized according to your needs. Don't hesitate to contact your Lytics Account Manager if you are interested in enabling this cookie-culling feature.
Once Lytics removes cookies after your specified time frame, not only the “stale” cookies are removed, but any other profile fragments attached to those cookies will be omitted from the stitching process. As a result, any associated data with the old cookies will not be included on user profilesunlessthat data can be matched to some other identifier (e.g., an email or user ID). However, the data lost from turning on cookie culling can be found again if the feature is turned off or if the time range is shortened so that the cookie associated with the missing data is no longer skipped.
The following information has been updated as of January 31, 2020.
Cookies are used for persistent login, preference storage, and tracking across websites. Google, Apple, and other browser providers have deployed functionality that can block the tracking of users across websites. This functionality is promoted as privacy-enhancing by giving a user greater control to prevent website tracking. The technology generally focuses on third-party cookies, but Apple’s technology also focuses on certain first-party cookies.
Apple introduced its Intelligent Tracking Protection (ITP) functionality in 2017 to block the use of cookies deployed on sites not belonging to the party issuing the cookie. You can track Safari ITP changes on Apple’sWebKitwebsite. Generally, Safari has set a 7-day expiration period on first-party cookies but a shorter 1-day setting on certain cookies used with link decoration. This means for users that don’t revisit a site within seven days to extend their expiration, the cookie will be deleted, and these users will get new identifiers the next time they visit the site.
Like Safari, Firefox blocks third-party cookies by default throughEnhanced Tracking Protection.
In 2019 Googleannouncedit was changing its approach to third-party cookies by not blocking them by default and recommending cookie developers useSameSite attributes. Chromegives users optionsto block the cookies they want to block and to delete cookies after a session (fingerprinting out as well).
In mid-January of 2020,Google announcedits intent to phase out support for third-party cookies in Chrome by 2022.

Paragraphs:
Channel tool authorizations refer to the permissions granted to various integrations that allow our platform to access and use data from third-party channels. These integrations can include email service providers, social media platforms, and advertising networks.
Once permission has been granted, Lytics surfaces "Authorizations," which allow you to manage and maintain the connection to your channel tools over time. This document outlines how to create and manage auths to ensure the long-term health of your data pipeline.
Authorizations are currently accessed from your account navigation menu by selectingAccount > Security > Authorizations.
Within the Authorizations section of the interface, you will see a list of existing Authorizations and a button to "+ Create New," clicking this button will take you to the Authorization wizard, where you will:
You will need authorization for most jobs when going through the job creation wizard in Lytics. At the "Choose Authorization" step, you can opt to create a new authorization which will direct you to the authorizations wizard in a new tab. You will be prompted to choose the method and configure the authorization before configuring your job.
Note that some integration providers only have one authorization method, but others offer multiple methods such as API keys, OAuth, etc. Specific methods may enable different jobs, such as real-time vs. bulk audience exports. If you are unsure which method to use, you can find more information in your provider's integration documentation.
For example, if you are looking to import event data from Google Cloud Pub/Sub into Lytics, there is only one method from the list of Google Cloud authorization methods that supports theImport Data (Cloud Pub/Sub)job in Lytics.
The Authorization Summary provides essential details about each authorization to help ensure an integration is appropriately set up to enable data to flow in and out of Lytics. At the top of the summary page, you’ll see the following information:
Lytics checks the status of authorizations daily to help you proactively resolve authorization issues. Our API will return one of three possible statuses, depending on the data available for your provider:
If your authorization is marked "Unhealthy," Lytics cannot verify that it has the requisite access and permissions. Visit the Authorization page for your provider and confirm that the authorization credentials you entered have the necessary permissions in the external tool.
If adjusting permissions in the external tool does not apply or is not an option, you may need to create a new authorization to use with your jobs in Lytics. You can optionally delete the unhealthy authorization.
You can edit or delete authorizations directly in the Lytics UI using the buttons at the top right of each authorization summary page. The edit option allows you to rename the authorization and revise the description, but the configuration options cannot be changed. If you need a different configuration, you must create a new Authorization, and you can delete the previous one.
You can only delete an authorization if no active jobs use it. If there are associated jobs with a running, sleeping, or paused status, you must delete those associated jobs before deleting the authorization. Likewise, you will need to delete any imported Experiences that are actively using an authorization before deleting that authorization.
Once metrics are available for each authorization, this chart will become populated with the number of requests made using the authorization. You can adjust the date window and toggle to view the metrics hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly, depending on the available data.
Authorization metrics are currently only available for select providers (including Facebook, Iterable, Salesforce, SendGrid, and others), but metrics support is being added for all providers.
This table provides a helpful organization of all active jobs using the current authorization. Jobs can be sorted by name, type, status, and creation date. Click on a job to view more details on the job summary page.
Authorizing the connection between Lytics and other providers allows you to create jobs to import, export, and enrich your first-party data.

Paragraphs:
Identity Resolution is a crucial component of customer communication. Establishing and maintaining a well-defined identity resolution strategy is essential, but it can be overwhelming to get started. Several challenges may arise, such as limited and outdated customer data, data silos, technical difficulties, in-flexibility, consistency, compliance, and maintenance.
Lytics offers a solution that powers brands' identity resolution strategies by aggregating data from disparate sources, defining a standardized customer schema, unifying disparate sources, surfacing individual consumer profiles, enabling better understanding, segmentation, and activation across channel tools, ensuring control, visibility, flexibility, security, privacy, and compliance, and maximizing match rates and accuracy across activation channels.
The goal is to construct complex consumer profiles and maintain accurate and compliant user profiles as your brand evolves. Defining the relationship between consumer identifiers is a necessary first step in surfacing unified user profiles that enable your brand to create the best consumer engagements while meeting evolving compliance requirements. To achieve this, we've broken our approach into three components:


Profile definition is the first step in surfacing unified user profiles that enable your brand to create the best consumer engagements while meeting evolving compliance requirements.
To build a strong identity resolution strategy, three key questions must be answered:

Data is messy. Lytics' Profile Materialization provides a necessary cleansing & polishing layer atop the defined resolution strategy. This ensures what is surfaced is accurate and accessible and enables your team to accelerate impact.
Answering the following two key questions guarantee profiles represent the ideal marketable entity:

Over time profiles will bloat, attributes will become stale, and use cases become more complex. If unmanaged, a quality identity strategy will begin breaking down the moment it is implemented.
Lytics prevents your identity strategy from breakdown through a set of powerful tools focused on ensuring the following profile health-related questions have concrete answers:
Behind each Lytics profile is an identity graph.  This graph represents connections between pieces of data observed across multiple sources or even within a single source.
To create (or update) profiles from a data stream, the stream must contain one or moreidentity keysthat identify distinct users with which to associate the data.  When data is observed for a given identity key, it stores the relevant profile metadata in an object called anidentity fragment.  When there's evidence on a data stream  that two keys or fragments should be connected
When evidence on a data stream shows that two keys or fragments identify the same real-world entity, those fragments become connected in the same identity graph.  Some identity graphs are significant and represent complex relationships in the data. In contrast, other identity graphs are small and describe a small interaction, like an anonymous cookie from a single-visit, incognito browser.

As you learned from the identity resolution overview, a profile comprises one or more identity fragments.  Many profiles start as singletons – new data is observed on a data stream. That event's identifier keys create any necessary identity fragments and store the event's associated data on that fragment.
However, we're not satisfied with several singletons – our objective is to stitch data sources together by linking the appropriate underlying fragments.  Stitching occurs when we observe two identifiers in a single event.  A common stitching event is a newsletter signup, where the email address from the newsletter form is linked to the cookie from their web activity and creates a link between activity from the browser on the device and any activity associated with the email address, which could eventually encompass purchases, support tickets, CRM data, etc.
In graph terms, stitching creates an edge between two nodes representing two identity fragments.  If we wanted to retrieve a profile associated with an email address, we would retrieve all of the fragments with edges or connections to other fragments.  From there, we'd want to find all of the connections to those other fragments, and so on, until there are no more connections to follow.  Following one fragment to another is calledtraversal.  The full set of fragments that are found to have connections to the initial fragment are calledneighbors.
In Lytics, default graph limits cap the number of traversals allowed for an individual profile at 50 and cap the number of neighbors allowed at 50.  Changing these values can create different sets of user profiles over the same data set and should not be adjusted lightly.  To change these values for your data, please contactLytics support.
As we traverse identity graphs, we'll quickly find that identity fragments and their corresponding identity keys are not all created equal. An identifier's strength must contribute proportionally to its influence on identity resolution.
For example, you have email addresses and cookies as identity keys.  Generally, a user identified with an email address can have multiple cookie values (from different devices, browsers, periods, etc.).  Imagine hosting a promotional, in-person event and having multiple tablets collecting participants' email addresses.  Depending on how those email addresses are collected (most likely through an online form), you'll likely have one cookie associated withmanyemail addresses.

Field types for Identity Keys can be either a string or a string set.  String sets are a common field type for cookies since one profile is expected to have many cookie values over time.  Email addresses are not so cut-and-dry.  Some organizations will constrain profiles to have one email address, while others will allow profiles to have multiple (personal, work, etc.).  In our example of email collection via physical tablet, if the email address is a single-valued string type, we won't end up with an over-merged hairball.
Using an identity key that allows for a set of values is usually a good idea to have a sensical capacity cap on the field type.  A set of cookies, for example, might have a capacity limit of 50 values.  On the other hand, a set of emails might have a capacity limit of 5 values.
The ranking of your identity keys should reflect their reliability and their relative importance in the strategy.  In the event of a conflict in stitching and merging, higher-ranked identity keys will win.  Typically, most Lytics users configure email identifiers to be ranked higher than cookie identifiers.
Imagine a scenario where email A is connected to cookies X and Y, while email B is connected to cookie Z.  If new data is observed that connects email B with cookie Y, we have aconflict, meaning that a resulting stitching between the two fragments would yield a profile with twodifferentemail fragments and violates our merge rules.
The ranks of identity keys would dictate that, for the new event, the email address it contains is of a higher priority than the cookie value that it contains and would consequently update the profile for Email A andnotthe profile for Email B.
We mentioned that a critical tenet of bulletproof identity resolution is that profile complexity remains stable over time.  That is, we need a way to ensure that a relatively greedy algorithm doesn't result in profiles becoming more fragile and susceptible to conflicts.
In Lytics, that is accomplished via graph compaction, a process by which data from multiple fragments is combined into a single fragment.  Doing so allows well-established relationships in the graph to be solidified while making room for new relationships within the profile.  It functions more as a type of profile housekeeping to keep profile fragments tidy.
Compaction in identity graphs can take on a few forms.
Let's go back to our example with Email A and Email B.  The point of identity resolution within a customer data platform is to enable long and rich relationships with customers.  The longer that Email A and Email B represent profiles in the platform, the more cookies with which they'll eventually become connected.  Each identity key's ranking allows an identity graph to compact by size or time.

As businesses continue to collect and utilize customer data to power their marketing efforts, obtaining, managing, and enforcing proper consent is crucial. This is important for complying with various privacy laws and regulations and maintaining trust with customers. This document will explore the importance of granularity in a consent strategy and how Lytics can assist in the consent management process. We will cover best practices to consider and provide guidance on where to get started. The following four steps will be outlined:
By following these steps, businesses can establish a solid and effective consent management strategy that respects customer privacy and builds trust.
To maintain compliance with data privacy regulations, businesses need a clear and flexible path for collecting consent data. Lytics offers a range of SDKs and data collection APIs to support this effort. When approaching consent data collection, it is essential to consider the following:
To address these considerations, Lytics has developed a suggested schema to get you started. Of course, this can always be customized viaConductorto meet your specific needs.
Effective consent management requires a comprehensive set of properties that can be deployed to ensure compliance and maintain customer trust. These properties should cover various aspects of data collection, storage, and usage and provide businesses with the tools to manage consent-related data effectively.
We are here to help!
Consent is not a one size fits all scenario. Each customers data and business goals are unique. Before deploying any of the following examples it is always recommended to consult with your Technical Account Manager or a Solutions Architect.
Lytics deploys a flexible data model, and though the following is not representative of every method of collection, we've highlighted two working examples leveraging our available SDKs as a baseline:
When using Lytics SDKs, you do not have to include date within the data passed in the consent event. The timestamp of the consent event can be used to create the field and mapping for the date of consent.
Building from the collection strategy outlined inCollecting Consent Data, we must determine how to materialize the consent-related data we've just collected to user profiles for segmentation. This can be achieved in a variety of ways. Regardless of the approach, however, it is essential to consider the level of granularity of the consent.
When collecting consent from users, obtaining granular consent for each specific use of a customer's personal data is an important consideration. Granular consent means that customers are provided with a clear understanding of the exact purposes for which their personal data will be used and can choose to consent or withhold consent for each specific use case.
For example, a business may seek granular consent from a customer to collect their email address and use it to send them promotional emails but not to share the email address with third-party partners for advertising purposes. This approach allows customers to make more informed decisions about how their personal data is used and provides greater control over their privacy.
Obtaining granular consent not only requires careful planning and clear communication with customers about the specific use cases for their personal data but also a rock-solid means for enforcing an individual's consent wishes across all future touchpoints.
Enforcement begins by ensuring consent wishes are accurately materialized on each user's profile. This is done by first defining consent-related attributes to be used in segmentation.
When defining profile fields, there are two primary considerations. What type of field should be used, such as astringor amapand how do you want to handle data merging when profiles are stitched?
Type StringBecause consent is something that may change for a consumer over time, the values must represent the most recent data. As such, thelatestmerge operator is always recommended. This means that as additional data is stitched to a user profile, the most recent events that are mapped to a field will win.

Type MapFor a more complex or granular consent strategy, the map field type can be very helpful in accurately managing consent. As such, themergemerge operator is always recommended when trying to keep the key-value pairs up to date to the most recent consent state. This means that as additional data is stitched to a user profile, the most recent events that are mapped to a key-value pair will win.

Mappings are then leveraged to determine how data from any number of streams map to the defined field. In the example below, we take a simple approach to map the boolean value of true or false to the consent field if the consent is related tomarketing-consent.
Though this is one elementary example, the same practice can be replicated to ensure a consent attribute has the status, timestamp, and context of any important policies or sources for segmentation.

Businesses can better understand their customers and create more effective campaigns by breaking down audiences into smaller, more targeted segments. Here we will discuss best practices for constructing "building block" audiences related to consent that can then be leveraged in campaign audiences. This progressive approach ensures consent rules are enforced while minimizing ongoing maintenance overhead.
Building Block Audiences provide the perfect means to maintain consent-related rules and extend the ruleset to all campaign audiences. The number and these audiences will depend on the granularity of your consent strategy. Still, as a basic example, we recommend creating both a "has consented" and "has not consented" counterpart for each level of consent.
This can be done simply through the GUI for our powerful segmentation engine, as shown below:

Once you have the necessary building blocks constructed, you can quickly integrate that rule set into your campaign audiences again through the GUI for our segmentation engine. The example below outlines a use case where you want to target high-value users who have opted in.

Configure a segment to prevent profiles from being sent to downstream destinations based on consent status or another relevant filter. This ensures that individuals who should be excluded will not be activated downstream.

ForAd User Data Consent, there are three separate options. Setting toGrantednotifies Google Ads that everyone in the audience has provided consent to send user data to Google for advertising purposes.
ForPersonalization Consentthere are the same three options. Setting toGrantednotifies Google Ads that everyone in the audience has provided consent for personalized advertising.
For more about these two fields and how they are interrpruted by Google Ads, visit theirFAQs.
Find the complete docs on the setting up a Google Ads Customer Match exporthere.
When setting up an audience export to Google DV360, you must check theUser Consent Confirmedcheckbox to confirm that you have collected all required consent for the exported audience.
If you have an ongoing audience export to Google DV360, those that haven't confirmed that user consent was granted will go into a failed state. For these jobs, if in fact you have confirmed consent, then you can edit the job, check theUser Consent Confirmedcheckbox and hit Complete. Once saved, you can select to retry the job and the export will update DV360 list with the consent confirmation, fulfilling the user consent requirements.

Amazon DSP takes a different approach than Google in helping you comply with DMA requirements. When setting up export of cookies or emails to Amazon DSP, you will be asked to select all the countries where the user info was collected in theCountry Codesinput.
Amazon DSP uses the source countries of your audience to prevent DMA requirements from being applied to out-of-scope countries such as UK, IN, US, JP etc.
Amazon will treat any audience without a country code as in-scope for DMA. Please note that if no country codes are selected, your export is likely to report a 0% match rate.
If you have an ongoing audience export to Amazon DSP, you can edit the job in Lytics, select the country codes that apply, and hit Complete. Lytics will then update the audience definition in Amazon DSP.

Paragraphs:
Everything you wanted to know about cookies from client side to server side.
An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to a user's web browser. The browser may store the cookie and send it back to the same server with later requests. Typically, an HTTP cookie is used to tell if two requests come from the same browser—keeping a user logged in, for example. It remembers stateful information for thestatelessHTTP protocol.
First-party cookies are created by the host domain – the domain the user is visiting. These cookies are generally considered good; they help provide a better user experience and keep the session open. This means the browser can remember key information, such as items you add to shopping carts, username, and language preferences.
Third-party cookies are those created by domains other than the one the user is visiting at the time and are mainly used for tracking and online-advertising purposes. They also allow website owners to provide certain services, such as live chats.
Logins, shopping carts, game scores, or anything else the server should remember.
User preferences, themes, and other settings.
Recording and analyzing user behavior.
Cookies are one of the preferred methods for maintaining a user identifier in the browser, both known and anonymous. This gets associated with all inbound events captured by our Javascript tag as they interact with customer websites. Specifically, our Javascript tag stores a string of digits and characters that are used as a unique ID commonly referred to as our_uidor, in some casesseeridas a first-party cookie.
In web development, the client-side refers to everything in a web application displayed on the client (end-user device). This includes what the user sees, such as text, images, and the rest of the UI, along with any actions an application performs within the user's browser.
When someone refers to a “client-side cookie,” they are generally referring to a cookie that is created and/or managed via a common client-side programming language such as Javascript.
Like with client-side, server-side means everything that happens on the server instead of on the client. In the past, nearly all business logic ran on the server-side, including rendering dynamic webpages, interacting with databases, identity authentication, and push notifications.
When someone refers to a “server-side cookie,” they are generally referring to a cookie that is created and managed using one of the many common server-side programming languages such as NodeJS, PHP, Python, etc.
Defines the cookie name. Generally, the cookie name is the primary way of retrieving a cookie and its associated value and attributes.
The stored value for the cookie. This can include any US-ASCII character excluding a control character, whitespace, double quotes, comma, semicolon, and backslash.
Indicates the maximum lifetime of the cookie as an HTTP-date timestamp. SeeDatefor the required formatting.
Indicates the number of seconds until the cookie expires. A zero or negative number will expire the cookie immediately.
Defines the host to which the cookie will be sent.
Indicates the path that must exist in the requested URL for the browser to send theCookieheader.
This indicates that the cookie is sent to the server only when a request is made with theHTTPS:scheme (except on localhost) and, therefore, is more resistant toman-in-the-middle attacks.
Forbids JavaScript from accessing the cookie, for example, through theDocument.cookieproperty. Note that a cookie created withHttpOnlywill still be sent with JavaScript-initiated requests, for example, when callingXMLHttpRequest.send()orfetch(). This mitigates attacks against cross-site scripting (XSS).
Controls whether or not a cookie is sent with cross-origin requests, providing some protection against cross-site request forgery attacks (CSRF).
In June 2017, Apple introduced a new privacy feature calledIntelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP). This same feature was officially released in September 2017 with Safari 12 and iOS 11. Since then, the ITP has evolved and introduced several subsequent versions leading us to the current state (as of July 2022), which has many impacts on marketing but most notably:
As a result of the privacy and security efforts in general other browsers such as Mozilla’s Firefox(ETP) and Google Chrome have followed suit in announcing and/or implementing their security and tracking protocols, which continue to impact tools such as third and first-party cookies that have long been a staple in providing the data necessary for marketers to personalize their communications effectively.
With each iteration on more stringent privacy-related changes comes a wave of workarounds or alternate approaches to maintaining access to behavioral data essential to marketing:
There is no replacement then a strong identification strategy. Creating a relationship in which a user will openly share their identity through a login or some other authenticated means will always result in the highest level of certainty on identity, which leads to the best level of personalization. However, many use cases focus on anonymous users or users who have not built up the relationship necessary to unlock this level of authentication.
Though third-party cookies are effectively dead, first-party cookies are still viable for many use cases. Not only do they offer a very simple off-the-shelf type of implementation for leveraging, they also have a long shelf life, assuming that an anonymous user interacts frequently enough to overcome the 7-day expiration window.
Over the past 12 months, there has been a surge of interest in server-side cookies. This method for setting cookies currently is not affected by the ITP changes that impact client-side cookies, most notably the automatic expiration at seven days. Rather, server-side cookies can live for long periods, leading to a higher quality identification for anonymous users. The downside, however, is they are far more difficult to leverage than the client-side. They require a much more technical integration with whatever server-side technology is used to power the web asset and may not be accessible in the same manner as client-side cookies.
In general, regardless of the specific attribute settings used when leveraging server-side cookies, they currently are not impacted by the 7-day expiration window that client-side cookies fall victim to. However, Apple has made it clear that they have additional plans to extend some of the client-side cookie limitations to the server-side, and the most important attribute in that discussion is theHttpOnlyattribute.
https://webkit.org/blog/9521/intelligent-tracking-prevention-2-3/
As a CDP and technology leader, we always aim to help our customers future-proof their implementations. As such, even though a non-HttpOnly server-side cookie offers an easier means to bypass current client-side restrictions, it is our recommendation to consider investing to leverageHttpOnlycookies set by the server-side to prevent any potential impacts of the next few iterations of ITP. Below we’ll explore the two options and demonstrate the key differences.
The following example in Node.js demonstrates a sample snippet for setting the cookie server side. Most server-side languages have existing methods to make this very easy. In the case of creating a cookie for Lytics to leverage, you will also need to generate a unique ID which can be done in a variety of ways. In the case of Node, you may consider using therandomUUID() method of the Crypto interface. A simple Google search can lead you or your developer down the road of generating a unique ID that best fits your use case.
Once you have that unique ID, you simply set the cookie using the pre-defined Lytics name our Javascript tag is looking for. Alternatively, the tag can be configured to use any custom name.
Since non-HttpOnly cookies are accessible out of the box client-side there is no additional lift necessary. Our tag will pick up the cookie and use that ID as the identifier. It is important to note that any UID changes must also be managed server-side as setting the cookie client-side will engage the 7-day expiration max. In this example, we simply raise an alert with the cookie string and do not show the actual implementation of the Lytics tag.
Setting HttpOnly to true comes with an additional level of complexity but benefits from following the stringent and recommended guidelines of Apple ITP, which in theory will go farther in the way of future-proofing.
Much like the above example, we’ll set a cookie, in this case using Node, in the same way. The only difference here is settinghttpOnlyto true. This means that the cookie is secure but will no longer be accessible out of the box by Javascript. Rather, you’ll have to implement an alternative method for surfacing that ID to Javascript so that it can be passed to the Lytics Javascript tag and used during collection/resolution.
All code examples in this document are purely for demonstration. Any customer facing implementation should follow the guidance of our customer facing technical teams and the technical experts on our customer’s end. These examples in production represent HIGH risk as documented.

Content Affinity
Crawling: https://docs.lytics.com/docs/content-curation
Paragraphs:
Content curation on Lytics involves scanning your website and other content to ingest topics and build content affinities. Properly setting up the curation process is key to enabling use cases such as promoting relevant ads and delivering targeted web content.
This document gives an overview of important concepts and considerations to make while curating your content during the early stages of implementation. It will also help determine if any custom content curation should be planned for.
Ensure that any content customization is performed to support your campaign execution and audience building, not for the sake of customization itself.
Once the Lytics JavaScript tag is installed, Lytics automatically begins crawling the content on your website using Natural Language Processing (NLP) engines. Put simply, this means that:
Lytics will index your content producing a list of all your content. By default, content includes your web pages and images.
Lytics will crawl the content via NLP providers (such asGoogle NLPorDiffbot, andextract topicsassociated with that content.
Over time, as users interact with your content, Lytics identifies user content affinity levels for various topics. While this functionality begins working right away without you having to do anything, there are various things to consider to ensure Lytics is bringing in the content you’ll need to execute use cases.
By default, Lytics will scan all content on your domains. You can specify which domains Lytics will scan by adding domains to the "Domain Allowlist", which can be modified by navigating toAccount Settings > Content.
If there are only certain sections of your website Lytics should be scanning, you can customize by allowing or blocking specific paths as well. For example, if you have a blog section and other pages won’t be relevant to gauge what users are interested in, you can add the path/blog/to the list of allowed paths.
You can see which domains have been improved in the domain and path settings on the Content Classification page. Visit the content account settings documentation for detailed instructions on how to add more domains or paths.
A website may have sections that should not be scanned for topics such as password reset pages or any pages hidden behind a log-in (e.g./password-reset/or/admin/). These paths can be blocked in your Account Settings under Content.
Lytics usesGoogle NLPwhich pulls from their knowledge graph/taxonomy. If you determine you're not getting enough topics from your content, Lytics can useDiffbotin addition to Google NLP, which has more loose associations between topics and content. You'll bring in more topics, but may be slightly surprised by what you see!
If your brand is international, you may need to consider which languages are supported by each NLP service. Please consult the provider documentation for a list of languages supported byGoogle NLPandDiffbot. Another option is to turn NLP completely off and use only custom topics.
For more details on each service Lytics uses, seeNLP services.
If you aren’t seeing the content you expected to, note it may take some time for Lytics to crawl all of your content. By default, monthly limits exist for scanning new content (seeContent Enrichment limitsbelow). If Lytics scans all new content without having reached the limit, Lytics will move on to older content until it is all scanned. Please allow time for this.
Also, consider how far back should Lytics be scanning. For example, it is likely unnecessary to scan content from 2 years ago. If people are no longer interacting with that content, use Account Settings to set a date to start the scan from.
Lytics will scan and enrich up to 20,000 URLs per month by default. This limit is designed to act as a guard rail to ensure good filter hygiene is in place. Most accounts do not publish close to 20,000 pieces of distinct content per month. If you believe your account is hitting this limit, please check with your Lytics Implementation team. Once confirmed, you can consider the following options:
Your domain likely has a robot directive (e.g.domain.com/robots.txt) that provides instructions to crawlers on how to crawl or index your content. Lytics will follow these directives. While typically not an issue, it’s worth turning to your directives when troubleshooting any missing content or information.
You may want to build a collection of content based on publish date or author. Consider the following if this is the case:
If you have metadata on your website, is it usingOpenGraph? Open Graph tags will populate the following default values in Lytics:title,image,published_time,description, andlytics:topics. You can check thelytics_contentqueryin your account to check if all the Open Graph tags you need are being picked up.
If you are not using Open Graph, Lytics may not be picking up any meta tags automatically. The quickest way to check that Lytics is bringing is to use our find a document tool to view the data Lytics has for a specific piece of content. Navigate toContent>Find a Documentand search for the URL of the piece of content you would like to view.
If you make changes to your content's metadata and would like to preview those changes you can use our manual classification tool located at the bottom of theContent>Classificationdashboard. Enter the URL with the updated metadata and clickGet Details. Lytics will scan the document and display a preview of the updated metadata. If you are satisfied with the changes clickComplete Classification. If not, you can make additional edits and preview again.
Alternatively, you can check by navigating toContent > Collections. Try to build content collections by author or publish date as these are the most commonly used filters. If the content doesn’t come up as expected, you may need to curate your tags.
For many users outside of publishing who may not have rich content, NLP derived topics aren’t enough. To accommodate this, Lytics can add custom topics via the metadata. The easiest way to do this is by adding thelytics:topicsmeta tag. Read more on providing custom topics.
If you already have topics in your metadata using a different meta tag than the above, it’s possible Lytics may be able to bring those in as well by making a change to your account settings. Speak with your implementation team about this.
Once this setting is changed and content is rescanned, you will be able to build content collections with this topic, and users' affinities will be generated for these new topics.
In the Lytics UI, you will see a max of 500 topics. Lytics keeps all of your topics, but only the top 500 are surfaced in the UI.
If you choose to allow topics, make sure that the topics actually exist - either as custom topics or are being generated by NLP. Case sensitivity is important when adding topics to the allow list. For example, allowingABBAis different than allowingAbba.
If you have other content on your site outside of web pages or images (e.g. PDFs) that you’d like to derive topics from and have them generate affinities, Lytics will need to develop a plan to bring those in using our APIs.
All topics - NLP derived or custom topics - will allow for two things:
There are instances where you may want to build collections based on a topic, but not have them generate affinities. For example, a collection of featured sale items, SKUs, genres, etc. You can set these asdocument propertiesin your metadata to allow for this.

Crawling: https://docs.lytics.com/docs/topic-taxonomy
Paragraphs:
Using data science techniques to look at the topic overlap between classified content, Lytics will programmatically build a topic taxonomy. In addition to programmatically building this taxonomy, Lytics dynamically adjusts the taxonomy as new content gets published.
The topic taxonomy is stored as a weighted and directional graph. Although this structure may be daunting to look at—and even more daunting to try and utilize by hand—Lytics uses it when determining content recommendations.

Topics are determined to be related by evaluating how they occur together and how they occur independently. When two topics occur together frequently (meaning in multiple documents), it is safe to assume they are related. In addition to the relationship existing, Lytics will determine thedirectionof the relationship. Is "Cookies" a subtopic of "Baking" or is "Baking" a subtopic of "Cookies"?
The co-occurrence of topics determines the relationship. The independent occurrence of a topic determines the direction. Since the topic "Cookies" frequently occurs with "Baking," but "Baking" frequently occurs without "Cookies," "Cookies" must be a subtopic of "Cookies." To draw this example further, "Baking" may be a subtopic of "Recipes," "Recipes" may be a subtopic of "Cooking," and "Cooking" may be a subtopic of "Hobbies."
This is important because it allows Lytics to make affinity inferences. A user with a high affinity for "Cookies" may be interested in general "Baking" content.
The weight between relationships is incredibly important to consider when making affinity inferences. For instance, Michael Jordan played baseball professionally for one dark year in the 90s. This means there are valid relationships between Michael Jordan and Baseball and Michael Jordan and Basketball. Most people who know anything about sports or pop culture know Michael Jordan as a basketball icon. The way this gets reflected in taxonomy is through relationship weights. The weight between Michael Jordan and Basketball is strong, while the weight between Michael Jordan and Baseball is weak.
By having weights, affinity inferences can use those weights as thresholds for building further relationships or recommending content. A user who has shown interest in Michael Jordan is more likely to be interested in Basketball than they are to be interested in Baseball. Unless they are interested in Sports Icons From The 90s, they might be more interested in Ken Griffey Jr. A rich topic taxonomy will surface this nuanced information.
A graph is the ideal data structure for topic taxonomies and taxonomies in general. Since each topic can have many subtopics and be the subtopic of many things, the correct way to structure this data is with a graph.
Leaders in data modeling use this approach. Notable examples are Facebook'sSocial Graphand Google'sKnowledge Graph.

Architecture
Crawling: https://docs.lytics.com/docs/integrated-marketing-tools
Paragraphs:
Lytics offers pre-built integrations for many of today’s most popular marketing tools to ease the onboarding and exporting of data. These integrations are available in the Data tab of the Lytics platform underData > Jobs. Each of these marketing tools has specific instructions for setup found in our integrations documentation.
The implementation type refers to the development methods used to implement the job. Usually this depends on the third-party provider's capabilities and the resources they provide to outside developers such as APIs or SDKs. Integrations may be client-side or server-side.
Client-side integrations are implemented in browser-facing code. These are implemented through the Lytics JavaScript tag and usually require you to have a tag from the third-party provider also installed on your web page. Given the nature of these integrations being tightly coupled to the browser session, these integrations collect and send data in real time. There are two types of client-side integrations:
A push integration pushes data from Lytics, such as surfaced fields or audience membership of users to the third party. Examples of push integrations include personalization tools such asPathfora SDKwhich uses Lytics user data to personalize the page with content based on audience membership, or data management platforms (DMPs) such as Krux, which transmits Lytics user information to the DMP.
A pull integration pulls data from the third party and imports it into Lytics. This data will differ based on the provider, and the exact fields available in the audience builder will be listed in the respective integration document. An example of this type of integration includes the Lytics JavaScript tag communicating with a data layer object on your website to collect data from various third-party vendors such as Tealium or even a custom implementation.
Server-side integrations allow Lytics and the third-party service to communicate directly, usually in the form of a job. These jobs are available to set up and execute in the Lytics platform underData > Jobs. There are two main types of Server-side integrations:
As the name implies, import integrations ingest data into Lytics. This data will differ based on the provider and job type. It can be anything from identifying information, demographic data, subscription status, or activity data for a user. Examples of import integrations include the Amplitude Cohorts Import which imports user data from Amplitude.
Export integrations send user profile data from Lytics to a third-party tool, usually at the audience level. You can select which audience(s) you want to export, and include user data such as user fields, audience membership and more such as the SendGrid User Export. However, some integrations may export raw event data or metrics for monitoring such as the BigQuery Event Export or the New Relic Insights Monitoring job.
An enrichment integration uses a third-party service to enhance and enrich existing user profiles within Lytics. These integrations require Lytics to push a list of user identifiers (defined by an audience of known users) to a third-party enrichment tool. That tool then returns additional data on that user such as information on the user's company (for B2B marketing), or additional demographic and social data. Examples of enrichment integrations include Full Contact Audience Enrichment and Clearbit User Enrichment jobs.
Many providers support both import and export job types for a complete two-way data sync between Lytics and the third-party tool.
Client and server-side integrations may be implemented in a number of different ways. The implementation technique often determines factors such as Tier, Frequency, and Resulting Data.
All default client-side integrations somehow utilize the Lytics JavaScript tag. The tag implements functions for sending data to a data stream and receiving user profile data which has been surfaced. Behind the scenes, these functions utilize some of the public Lytics API endpoints.
API integrations utilize REST or SOAP APIs the third-party vendor provides to send or receive data. The specific endpoints used are listed in the documentation for the integration. Lytics prefers to integrate with third parties via API as it provides a deeper out-of-the-box integration.
Audience triggers are used in conjunction with an API implementation for export or enrichment job types. Audience triggers are powered by an internal system called subscriptions. Subscriptions listen to specific events, such as when a user has entered or exited an audience. A subscription can then send a trigger to any job listening to the subscription. Once received, the job can push the updated user data to the third-party tool via APIs. This process enables real-time exports versus a scheduled batch export.
Lytics supports file-based import and export jobs.
Files may be obtained or pushed to a server viaSecure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). SFTP integrations may be provided for third-party vendors who do not have API capabilities or as part of a custom integration. Lytics has a managed SFTP server that can be used to transfer files, or it may retrieve files from a third-party SFTP server.
Another example of a file-based export is viaEmail Attachment, such as the CSV Email Export.
Many third-party vendors offer webhooks or API callbacks, which send requests containing relevant user-activity data to another service after an event has occurred in the system. The Lytics API has a collection endpoint that can be used as a destination for third-party webhooks. Providers that support webhooks will have documentation detailing the preferred setup method for Lytics to receive webhook data.
In addition, Lytics supports webhooks that can be configured to send user-level events, such as real-time audience membership updates.
Frequency describes when and how often that data is sent or received. It attempts to answer common questions such as: "When will I see data in my tool?" and "Can I keep my data up-to-date?" Lytics integrations are either real-time or scheduled.
A number of different integration types are considered real-time (or "near" real-time). In that, user data is sent or received downstream as soon as the data is available in the native system. The following types of integrations are considered real-time:
Jobs that use audience triggers also often have an option to perform a backfill of users. Without a backfill, only new users who enter the audience after the time of job setup will be processed. Enabling a one-time backfill as part of the job configuration will immediately process a batch of all existing users in the audience to the third-party tool and then rely on real-time triggers to update user information once the backfill is finished. Some jobs support this feature as a configurable option. If so, it is listed under the "Frequency" section of "Integration Details" in a job's documentation.
Batch integrations send or receive user data in larger batches. Depending on the configuration of the job, it may only import/export a single batch of users once, or it may run continuously, checking for new users and updates to existing user data.
The final way Lytics categorizes integrations is by the type of data it handles and how the job output is perceived. The resulting export and push integration data will vary based on the structures supported by the provider tool, and each integration will document the specific output type. Here is a list of common data types in Lytics for import and pull integrations:
When you import users, you will likely see new user profiles created for users that previously did not have data associated with them in Lytics. However, you may also see updates to existing users' profiles, if Lytics is able to recognize an existing user based on the identity resolution strategy for your account.
The new user fields that are created as part of an integration are listed in the "Fields" section of each doc. These fields will be added to new and existing user profiles as described in the section above, and they will become available for segmentation in the audience builder.
If data is imported to Lytics without being mapped by LQL, this data is stored as raw fields in data streams, which are un-actionable. For example, if you are importing custom data via CSV, you will need queries in place for the raw data to be meaningful. In addition, some pre-built integrations may import additional fields that are not mapped as part of the default queries provided by the out-of-the-box integration. You may contactsupportfor assistance with mapping these fields.
In addition to user data, some integrations may ingest content that can be analyzed and processed by the Lytics Content Affinity Engine. An example of this is the MailChimp Import which, in addition to user data, brings in content from your MailChimp email campaigns. This content can help inform affinity scores for users who have viewed and interacted with the email.
This is an uncommon pattern in existing integrations, but Lytics can also import specific metrics from third-party tools. For example, in the Goal Canvas, Facebook Experience metrics are imported directly from the Facebook Insights API. Metrics that are imported to Lytics are accessible via the Metrics API.
File imports and exports can be decrypted and encrypted, respectively usingPretty Good Privacy(PGP). To create or ingest PGP encrypted files, use an authorization that includes PGP keys.
Follow the instructions below when creating a PGP authorization.
Use a PGP Public Key authorization to encrypt file exports. You will need togenerate an armored PGP key pairif you haven't already.
In the PGP Public Key field, enter your public key. Be sure to include the header and footer of the armored key. This means your entry should begin and end with the following:
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----and-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
If your key does not begin and end with these strings respectively, it is possible it has not been ASCII armored.
Use a PGP Private Key authorization to decrypt file imports. You will need the private key that is paired with the public key used to encrypt the file.
In the PGP Private Key field, enter your private key. Be sure to include the header and footer of the armored key. This means your entry should begin and end with the following:
-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----and-----END PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----
If your key does not begin and end with these strings respectively, it is possible it has not been ASCII armored.
If your private key has been protected with a passphrase, enter the passphrase in the field labeledPGP Private Key Passphrase. If your private key is not passphrase protected, leave this field empty.
Note: in order for Lytics to decrypt the file successfully, you will need to provide the private key that is paired with the public key that was used to encrypt the file.
User profile fields can be dynamically inserted into an alert using  templating of supported fields including the alert title, alert subtitle, and alert body fields. Lytics usesGolang's template packageto provide this functionality. The data available to you will vary based on the data available on each individual profile.
You can download a customer profile to see a list of fields available on your user profiles. For example, if you want to include a user's name in an alert and the field containing the name is calledfirst_name, a template like the following could be used:
Notice the "." before the name of the profile field.
Some profiles may not have a first-name field. To avoid sending an incoherent alert when you don't have the first name field available, a template like the following could be used:
Alternatively, if you would rather include a default name when the field does not exist on the profile, a template like the following could be used:
If you would like to make sure that multiple fields on a profile exist, a template like the following could be used:
To check equality on a particular profile field, you can create a template like the following:

Lytics Job runtime and APIs control the mechanics of how data flows in and out of Lytics.  Lytics jobs can be generally broken down into a few important categories:
Knowing which type of job you're dealing with can help guide expectations for behavior and troubleshooting.
Some jobs, like specific Webhook flows, don't require explicit credentials to access external systems.  However, most jobs require some form of authorization to retrieve data from or send data to external systems.  In Lytics, these credentials are generically referred to as Authorizations.
Authorizations can be managed from theAuth API, or directly from the Lytics interface.  All authorizations are either configuration-based or OAuth-based.
Commonly, authorizations will change – some systems require periodic password changes, tokens get revoked, users who complete OAuth flows leave an organization, etc.  Consequently, a job that is running successfully with authorization today may fail tomorrow if the authorization is no longer valid.  If you know in advance that credentials will update or change, it is recommended that you create a new authorization and update the job to use the new one.
To stay alerted on the health status of a job, you can set up alerts as described in theMonitoringsection below.
Jobs can be managed from theJobs API, or directly from the Lytics interface.
Each job has custom configuration options that tell the job when to run, what type of data to pull, which lists to pull data from in external systems, how to send the data to downstream sources, etc.  Each job's API endpoint will validate the presence of any required parameters, or other conditions that must be satisfied for the job to run correctly.  In the event of a validation error in the job configuration, the API will return a 400 error with a message indicating what is misconfigured.
If the configuration for the job request is valid, the job will be immediately submitted to Lytics internal job running system.
Jobs running on Lytics' internal job running system may be in any of the following states:
Jobs will usually first enter into a Runnable state.  If the job is fed input from real-time triggers, it will stay running unless it encounters any errors.  If the job runs on a batched interval, it will usually switch between Runnable and Sleeping.

While most transitions happen automatically in the system (Runnable → Completed, for example), some are triggered manually, namely:
There are a variety of reasons a job will enter a Failed state, including:
When an error occurs, the job will enter a Sleeping state, and retry a minute later.  If an error occurs on the second attempted run, the job will sleep double the amount of time as the previous run.  If errors still occur after two hours, the job will enter a Failed state.
Any failed work can be manually restarted, through the Job API or through the Lytics interface.  If, for example, a job is in a failed state because of an authorization issue, you can create a new authorization for the job and restart it.
Many jobs are maintained by Lytics, and even more workflows can be enabled by using our generic tooling for Webhook and SFTP-based integration flows.
Some jobs are open-sourced and run on Conductor's Opus framework for running jobs. Check out ourConductor Opus Template on GiHubto get started creating your own jobs.

Paragraphs:
When data is brought into Lytics, it organizes diverse data structures and tables to accommodate the customer's evolving data activation requirements. This document will delve into the various data storage methods employed by Lytics and explain the purpose, access, and behavior of these different storage structures.

The system records each unique identifier (ID) as separate nodes within the graph structure. A collection of nodes linked by edges corresponds to a singular profile. The data associated with the most robust ID present in an incoming event is stored. While not directly accessible via the API, this information is made available through the "Identity" tab in the conductor. The graph undergoes immediate updates upon the arrival of new events. Generally, the response time from a graph update to the corresponding entity ranges from milliseconds to seconds.
Graph view of consumer profiles in Conductor
The system efficiently stores every event received from Lytics, both in batch and real-time modes. Each event includes a timestamp indicating when the event took place and when it entered the Lytics system. Although this information is not directly accessible through the API or user interface (UI), it is possible to transmit the events downstream using our out-of-the-box (OOTB) integrations, such as theBigQuery (BQ)export feature. This scenario seamlessly transfers the events from the raw storage to designated downstream tables. These operations can be initiated or concluded at any given time. The raw storage option also serves as a valuable resource for replaying data in the event of corrupted or malformed data, ensuring data integrity throughout the account.
The system diligently maintains and stores the latest Lytics profiles, ensuring their accuracy and relevance. These profiles encompass various attributes, such as scores and segment memberships. Users can conveniently access these profiles through the user interface (UI) using the Decision Engine functionality. Additionally, the profiles can be retrieved programmatically via the API, utilizing any of the existing profile IDs.
To facilitate this process, you can reference the profile's URL in the UI, which contains the necessary ID value for API access.
URL Example :https://app.lytics.com/entity/user/_uids/[ProfileID]?aid=[AID]&view=details
The transition from data entry to the updated entity is typically swift, with response times ranging from milliseconds to seconds. The updated entity is a valuable resource for real-time activations, including trigger-based exports, membership in client-side experiences or audiences, and client-side attribute updates. These functionalities enable seamless and immediate user interactions based on their up-to-date profiles.
Entity view of consumer profiles in Decision Engine


The system securely stores and maintains up-to-date Lytics Audiences, encompassing profiles and their membership within these audiences. The system employs indexes on profile attributes to facilitate efficient retrieval and modifications, enabling fast access to the desired data. Users can conveniently access and interact with the audiences through the user interface (UI) using the Decision Engine feature. Alternatively, audiences can be accessed programmatically via the API, providing flexibility for data retrieval in a one-to-many fashion.
Audiences can be created throughLytics Segment APIusing Segment QL, offering a powerful tool for audience customization. When referencing audiences in the UI, the Segment ID can be found within the URL, aiding API-based operations.
URL Example:https://app.lytics.com/audiences/[SegmentID]summary?aid=AID
As the last table to be updated after an event, the audience table exhibits a slightly longer update time compared to other components. However, since this table is not involved in real-time processes, it does not impact latency or affect the responsiveness of other functionalities.
Note:To allow the system indexes on profile attributes, the creation of new fields will need to be added to this index first, creating an additional delay before new fields will be visible in the audience builder.
The Segment feature is vital in several aspects, including audience creation, populating the field information tab, and facilitating batch exports. It is a fundamental building block for audience segmentation and targeted campaigns within the Lytics platform.Audience view in Decision Engine

Paragraphs:
This guide streamlines the integration of Customer Data Infrastructure (CDI) and Customer Data Platform (CDP) into your marketing technology framework. Given the overlapping functionalities of both tools, distinguishing their roles in marketing activation is crucial. By clearly assigning responsibilities and adhering to best practices for each platform, businesses can improve customer profiling, segmentation, and activation efforts, all while eliminating data redundancies and streamlining processes.
Give clear roles and responsibilities to each tool in order to limit duplicative processes.
CDI Responsibilities:Focus on data collection, routing, and transformation. Establish how it will handle website tagging and funnel web-based data appropriately.
CDP Responsibilities (Lytics): Concentrate on activation, segmentation, and customer interactions. Define the specific data that should be directly ingested into the CDP.
Simultaneous Implementation:Understand the end-state requirements for your data in the CDP to guide the setup of your CDI, avoiding redundant reconfiguration.
Feature Allocation:Assign primary tasks (e.g., identity resolution, segmentation) to one platform to reduce complexity and maintenance challenges.
Define Tool Roles:Clearly outline why each tool was chosen based on its strengths and intended use in your martech strategy.
Data Flow and Schema:Align data types and formats with primary activation use cases, ensuring CDI processes non-marketing data and CDP focuses on customer engagement data.
Identity Resolution:Develop a joint strategy for both platforms to unify customer profiles promptly, ensuring a seamless customer journey across all touchpoints.
Activation Channel Allocation:Specify which platform will manage client-side and server-side activations to prevent overlapping functionalities and increased costs.
Client-Side vs. Server-Side:Clearly distinguish between the two, utilizing each for its strengths in anonymous and known activations.
Unique Integrations:Treat similar functionalities, like JavaScript tags, as distinct integrations based on their roles within each platform.
Regularly update your integration strategy within the Martech Center of Excellence to accommodate new tools and data sources, ensuring consistent and efficient use of your CDI and CDP platforms.
This involves:
By following this focused approach, businesses can efficiently leverage the strengths of CDI and CDP platforms, ensuring a cohesive and powerful marketing technology ecosystem.

Paragraphs:
As the landscape of data strategies within the Customer Data Platform (CDP) area progresses, cloud warehouses have emerged as a core element of the overarching marketing technology (martech) strategy. Centralizing customer data in a single repository enables enhanced, comprehensive customer insights while reducing exposure and failure points throughout the data pipeline.
Nonetheless, this centralization poses the challenge of effectively leveraging this wealth of data across the martech stack for maximum value with minimal risk of additional data exposure and duplication.
Lytics has developed the Cloud Connect product to address this, which serves as a materialized layer atop the cloud warehouse and facilitates direct segmentation and activation.
This model allows customers to employ either SQL or AI to craft consumer audiences, which can subsequently be activated downstream.
Importantly, this method does not involve long-term data storage within Lytics but instead generates a transient profile context that disappears once the Cloud Connect model is deleted.
This strategy leverages the Zero Copy approach, utilizing Lytics' identification and data science capabilities. Hence, it transcends the limitations of data stored in the customer warehouse. Cloud Connect audiences can be enriched with Lytics' behavioral scores, profile affinities, content recommendations, and predictive models alongside Lytics' top-tier identity solution. Consequently, Lytics' customers can implement a dynamic, maintenance-light activation strategy over time.

Paragraphs:
Consumers engage with your brand across many channels, resulting in vast amounts of rich behavioral data siloed away across various channel tools. Lytics connects to these channels via Jobs to aggregate and unify that data into a comprehensive view of the customer. This enables you to gain deeper insights, create personalized experiences, and drive revenue.
The landscape in which your consumers interact is broad. To ensure Lytics makes it easy to both collect and deliver essential data, insights, and audiences, we have a variety ofintegration options.
Import Jobs are managed by Lytics and are responsible for automating, where applicable, the process of:
Similarly, Export Jobs are managed by Lytics and are responsible for automating, where applicable, the process of:
New data import Jobs are added from the Conductor interface by first navigating to theJobssection under thePipelinesection in the main navigation.

From there, you'll click "+ Create New" at the top of the list and enter the wizard to guide you through the creation process.

Each Job is first categorized by the provider, making it easy to narrow down the channel you'd like to integrate with. To select a provider, click the tile representing your desired provider, such as "Google."

With the provider selected, we'll surface the various ways you can integrate with that particular provider. This will vary significantly by the provider.

Each provider and job type may require additional authorization to finalize the connection. On the "select authorization" step, you can either select an existing authorization or create a new one. When creating a new authorization, you will be asked to provide the required credentials, such as key and secret, to proceed.

You can create it during source configuration if you lack valid authorization for your desired provider/source combination. Click "Create new Authorization" above the list, follow thewizard in Vault, and return to where you left off.
The final step lets you provide the specific configuration details for your chosen provider and job type. Again, the options supported by each provider will vary greatly, and provider-specificintegration detailsshould be leveraged to determine the optimal approach.

Once you have one or more Source jobs running, they will be accessible from the Source list view, as pictured below. This view provides quick access to essential details:

Detailed states are provided to understand better what is happening in the background during a job's lifecycle. These states will vary by job but include:
For more information on job states or troubleshooting failed jobs, seejob processing.
Clicking on any of the items in the Source list will navigate to its dedicated summary view for greater detail. This summary provides all the relevant information about each job you've created in Lytics and an entry point to alter the configuration or status.
At the top of the Job Summary page, you’ll find the following quick-access information:
You can edit the name and description of an existing job from its summary page to improve the organization and clarity of your account's list of jobs.
The activity chart will provide metrics (if available) on a job's performance to give a better understanding of how your data is flowing in and out of Lytics. You can see the number of profiles the job added, removed, or omitted during the selected time frame.Note this feature is currently in development. Once metrics are available for each job, this chart will become populated.

The configuration section displays a JSON view of your job's current configuration. This includes details such as the authorization used, where data is coming from, which data is being pulled in, etc.

The Logs section records the history of events for this job, details about the work completed, and the time each job was run. The logs are helpful to ensure your work is running as expected and for troubleshooting if any issues arise. Below are descriptions of the job events you may see in the logs.
Some use cases involve having historical data available for segmentation.  This data might be demographic in nature, or describe how customers prefer to be contacted. This document offers guidelines for cases where large amounts of this data must be available in your Lytics account.
A real-timedata streamcontains messages sent in response to the activity they describe. This is distinguished from batched data streams, where messages are sent in groups on a given schedule or according to another trigger.
For attributes that will be kept updated by a real-time stream, there is the additional requirement to populate that attribute with a substantial amount of pre-existing information, separating that backfilling from now-forward messages.
Backfill messages can be sent using multiple means. API loads should be sent via the bulk CSV or bulk JSON endpoints. It is also possible to use integration workflows to import this data, such asAmazon Web Services (AWS) S3.
The benefit of separating this data from real-time message streams is that the processing of backfill messages does not impact the processing time of messages received from real-time streams. The bulk imports are processed in parallel to real-time messages. This means that marketing activations reliant on real-time updates are not affected.
Whenever possible,allmessages should have an explicit timestamp. While all messages are additionally time stamped by Lytics at the time of ingestion, specifying a message timestamp is helpful in all circumstances, particularly in cases when messages are received out of order so that Lytics knows which one is the most up-to-date.  It is essential when a backfill occurs concurrently with a real-time stream of the same attribute.
All means of loading data permit specifying timestamps. Via API, this is via atimestamp_fieldURL parameter. In the Admin UI, data import configuration options feature a menu to pick among the file schema for a timestamp field.
All messages imported into your Lytics account are stored in their raw form and represented as profile attributes in the graph. The purpose of storing all messages is to enable the reprocessing of those messages, a process calledrebuilding. Rebuilding enables all received messages to be represented differently with different attributes, identity resolution rules, etc.
All data ingested into Lytics incrementally increase the overhead of rebuilding, making it a longer and more processing-intensive operation. Therefore, before importing large amounts of data, consider the value/benefit of that data. If there is no clear use case for backfilling, consider skipping it.

Paragraphs:
A data stream is a continuous flow of data generated from various sources such as websites, mobile apps, email providers, social media, and other digital platforms. Data streams typically involve high volumes of data generated in real-time or near-real-time, making it necessary to process and analyze the data as it arrives.
Lytics allows for creating any number of data streams to provide logical distinctions among data sources in either type or scope. For example, data describing email subscriber attributes should exist on a different data stream than one describing email subscriber activity. This ensures maximum flexibility when defining the relationships between sources and how they ultimately are unified into a materialized user profile.
In Lytics, an "event" is an action or activity performed by a user or a customer, such as visiting a website, purchasing, or subscribing to a newsletter. As pictured below, events are showcased as independent key/value pairs on a single data stream. Thesekeysare then translated intoFields & Mappingsin order to materialize to user profile for segmentation.

Lytics will ingest data that is sent to one of Lytics' Collection APIs: the collect API or the bulk API. The bulk API is generally intended for larger imports of offline data, while the collect API is generally intended for more real-time sources and usage.
You can view information about your data streams in your Lytics dashboard by navigating toConductor>Pipeline>Streams. The primary purpose of this section is to verify that data is successfully being received by Lytics. If your account has multiple data streams, you can view a different stream from the dropdown menu above the graph.
Many integrations have multiple streams. For instance, it is common for email integrations to have an activity stream and a user stream. Integration streams should be prefixed to help identify the source. You can find the streams for integration under the documentation for that integration.
The number of keys in a data stream can be extremely large. This is normal and does not impact performance. Any keys that comprise less than 0.1% of the data volume OR have not been seen in 7 days will be hidden from display to reduce clutter.
The event ingress graph shows the number of events collected on a stream for the selected time period (past day, week, month, 3 months, and year)  and interval (hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly). Above the graph, you will find the time the last message from this stream was received, the source of the data stream, and the number of fields in the stream.
Last message received strives for real time reporting but can lag under a number of conditions including during bulk imports. If a data stream is not updating as expected please contactLytics Supportfor assistance.

Below the event ingress graph is the raw keys table. An event may contain any number of key-value pairs. Each record in this table represents a unique raw key seen on the stream in at least one event.

The table has the following information on keys:
In addition to these seven columns, each record in the table can be clicked to open up a set of sample values. This can be used to verify that values are being collected and they match the expected data.
If a key has many different values, the modal may not display all the values for the chosen key.
The table can be filtered in three ways: used vs. unused, common vs. uncommon, and text search.
Raw event keys can be hidden, but it is important to note that keys cannot be made visible again through the user interface - only through the API. It is recommended that a list is kept of hidden keys in the event one needs to be resurfaced at a later date. If you need assistance, please contactLytics Supportwith your key name and account ID.
To hide a key:
Having logically differentiated data streams for different data sources also helps to facilitate a more straightforward process for mapping data from data sources to user profiles. However, integrating data from some data providers can make this distinction difficult.  For example, data routers like Segment or Rudderstack can route data from multiple sources into a single destination, like Lytics.

Paragraphs:
V2 Conductor Schema does not have a direct analog forWHEREclauses in V1 schema, or LQL. In V1, for example, it was possible to describe a clause to filter data that is mapped for a stream, such as the following, which ignores events whose_urlfield contains the stringlocalhost:
To achieve the same result in accounts with Conductor Schema turned on, we need to use the Stream Route Rules API, whose endpoints include the following:
Route rules define data to route from oneinputstream to anotheroutputstream. On ingress, the stream on the record is overwritten frominputtooutputif the rule is active and evaluates to true when executed against the incoming record.
The mechanics of this imply one important distinction relative to V1WHEREclauses: since route rules describe which records to redirect away from the input stream, rather than which records to evaluate for the input stream, they are in effect theinverseofWHEREclauses. If, for example, we want to ignore urls containing the stringlocalhostfrom our input streamappin theWHEREclause above, we would need to define a route rule containing the following expression (which is the precise inverse of ourWHEREclause):
This tells the system to redirect events matching this expression to a new output stream we define on the route rule object. By convention, if we don't care about mapping records that match our route rule, we call that output stream{input-stream}_divert, and define the following route rule object (note the need to escape double quotes inside the expression so that our object is valid JSON):
Note: If there is a use case to take all events and route them to theoutputstream, theexpressioncan hold the string value of"true"instead of a logic condition. i.e."expression": "true"
Our object includes several properties which should be self-explanatory:account_id,aid, andname. The rest are as follows:
Note that because these route rules are cached, it will take up to 10 minutes for any updates you make to take effect.
To create our sample route rule, we make the following call. If successful, the response body will include the full route rule object, including a system-generated ID which can be used for subsequent calls against the object:
When data is routed from theinputstream to theoutputstream, Lytics will associate the raw routed data to theoutputstream. This means when a raw activity data is exported, the data that was routed will be associated with theoutputstream only.
An optional feature with all streams is to addBehavioral Scoringto selected streams. If a behavioral scores are desired for a specific stream make sure the stream that is being targeted is the routingoutputstream andnotthe input stream.

Lytics Templates are used with the Lytics Webhook Export workflow provide a powerful interface for users to create bespoke, real time integrations with arbitrary third-party API destinations. Templates can be defined in the UI or via Lytics APIs to configure the payload and profile data that would be passed. Templates created using the API can be defined inJsonnet/Handlebars. Once made, they can be selected for use in a Webhook Export, executing against the outgoing payload for each request.
Templates are available in the Lytics UI under theData Pipelinesection. The Templates Overview page shows all the templates in an account, as well as an action button to create a new template.

Creating Templates
Crawling: https://docs.lytics.com/docs/api-created-templates
Paragraphs:
Templates can be created, tested, and managed using the Lytics Template APIs. Full API documentation can be foundhere. To create a template, simply submit a Jsonnet or Handlebars file to the/v2/templateendpoint like this (seebelowfor more information on using thelytemplates.libsonnetlibrary in Jsonnet templates):
The endpoint requiresnameandtypequery parameters. An optionaldescriptioncan also be included.
Once templates have been created, the/v2/template/:id/testendpoint makes it easy to test the template's behavior given a particular job configuration and outgoing user profile. A configuration can be included in your request, as well as a custom entity profile. If no entity is included in the request, the API will auto-generate one from your Lytics user table schema:
One of the primary use-cases for templates is for shaping the request payload for outgoing Webhook Exports from Lytics. For example, say you are exporting a Lytics audience calledfrequent_visitorsto a service that expects the following JSON in the request body:
We could create the following template in Lytics, and select it in our Webhook Export job configuration to send the correct request, using thefirst_name,last_name, andemailfields on your Lytics profiles (seeherefor details on using thelytemplates.libsonnetlibrary):
Once created, this template can be selected from theLytics Templatedropdown menu in thewebhook job configuration.
Many times when sending webhook events, certain fieldsmustbe set or the webhook endpoint will respond with an HTTP error, causing the webhook job to fail.
This simple template uses the Jsonnetassertfunction to signal that email must be set before sending. These events will be omitted from sending and will be logged with the included assertion messageemail must be set.
You can also use a template to dynamically generate URLs for webhook requests instead of hard-coding one in your jobconfiguration. Say you are exporting Lytics profiles to a service that expects requests to the following endpoint where{email}is the user's email address:
We could create the following template, which extracts the email from each Lytics profile and includes it in the URL:
Once created, this template can be selected from theWebhook URLdropdown menu in thewebhook job configuration.

The following methods oneventcan be used to access data on the profile and job configuration:
Reports whether the entity on the event contains a field namedfield.
Retrieves the field on the profile namedfield. Iffielddoes not exist on the profile, the optionaldefaultwill be returned, or null ifdefaultis not supplied.
Retrieves the job configuration field namedkey. Ifkeydoes not exist in the job configuration, the optionaldefaultwill be returned, or null ifdefaultis not supplied.

Reports whether the trigger event is an exit event.
Returns the segment slug for the trigger event.
Returns the sha256 hash ofobj
Returns whether obj matches the formatting of a sha256 hash
Returns the sha1 hash ofobj
Returns whether obj matches the formatting of a sha1 hash
If a field callconfigFieldexists on the job configuration, retrieves the field corresponding to the field's value from the user profile.

We could create the following template in Lytics, and select it in our Webhook Export job configuration to send the correct request, using thefirst_name,last_name, andemailfields on your Lytics profiles (seeherefor details on using thelytemplates.libsonnetlibrary):
Once created, this template can be selected from theLytics Templatedropdown menu in thewebhook job configuration.
Many times when sending webhook events, certain fieldsmustbe set or the webhook endpoint will respond with an HTTP error, causing the webhook job to fail.
This simple template uses the jsonnetassertfunction to signal that email must be set before sending. These events will be omitted from sending and will be logged with the included assertion messageemail must be set.
You can also use a template to dynamically generate URLs for webhook requests instead of hard-coding one in your jobconfiguration. Say you are exporting Lytics profiles to a service that expects requests to the following endpoint where{email}is the user's email address:
We could create the following template, which extracts the email from each Lytics profile and includes it in the URL:
Once created, this template can be selected from theWebhook URLdropdown menu in thewebhook job configuration.

Paragraphs:
User fields and mappings are essential for materializing user profiles in such a way that provides businesses with a comprehensive view of their customers. User fields capture specific attributes and characteristics, while mappings transform and cleanse data for consistency and accuracy. This ensures your profiles are materialized in an ideal way to support highly relevant and personalized marketing campaigns.
Fields can include demographic data, behavioral data, or any other data point that is relevant to understanding and engaging with customers. In addition, fields themselves are defined by one of many common data types, such as strings, integers, sets, and maps.

Sometimes, you may want to transform or cleanse messy data before it hits a profile.  Other times, you may want to perform an operation or aggregation to reflect its usefulness for business decisions or segmentation — like aggregating multiple purchases into a combined lifetime spend metric. In either case, mappings provide the necessary translation layer to ensure each data point collected is clean and consistent. Most importantly, mappings guide the relationship between disparate data points and the final materialized user profile.

Lytics' profiles are composed of a collection of user fields.  These fields have standard metadata (name, description) and typical properties you'd expect from a traditional database column (kind/type, capacity).  In addition, each field has amerge operatorthat describes how we want to combine data from different sources at different times into a single field.  For example, a field describing a customer's first purchase date would use aminimumoperator to ensure that, regardless of the order in which Lytics sees purchase data, the first purchase date for the field would represent theearliestpossible value.
To create a user field, visitFieldsunder theSchematab in the main navigation at the left of your window. Here you will find a list of all current field definitions. Clicking on+ Create Newwill enter the field creation wizard.

The field creation wizard has a single step where you will define a few parameters related to your new user field.
Standard:
Advanced:
Supported merge operators are as follows:
Thekeep_daysandcapacityproperties specify the amount of time to keep values, and the number of values to retain in a set field, respectively. Any values in the set older thankeep_daysin the past will be discarded when the profile is evaluated, and no more thancapacityvalues will be stored in the set. When values are removed from a set due to exceeding the capacity limit, they are removed in FIFO (first in, first out) order. Ifkeep_daysorcapacityare set to 0 or omitted when creating a field, they are ignored.
As your schema grows in complexity, keeping an eye on the defined relationships is essential. The field summary provides a window into how a single user field is being populated from various channels. This view is excellent for diagnosing what may be causing a conflict or that things are operating healthily.

Sometimes you may want to remove a user field from your schema altogether. This can be done from the field summary pictured above. Click the menu with three docs to the right ofEdit Fieldand you will be presented with a sub-menu. This menu contains aDeleteoption.

Deleting a field can have major implications once the change has been published. It is important to understand the implications of deleting a field and how it will impact how data is processed and mapped to user profiles.
As shown in the screenshot above, selecting and confirming deletion will not have an immediate impact. The delete will request will be referenced in the unpublished version of your schema. You must publish a new version of your schema for the changes to take effect. At that point, it is essential to understand the following:
Mappings are expressions that provide instructions for how to perform transformations (if any) on raw data.  They can range from simple to expressive or even include conditional logic.
Mappings occur when data is processed or observed within Lytics' real-time profile pipeline.  Multiple mappings can map data into a single field, where the field's merge operator controls updates.
Let's say we have a user currently visiting the lytics.com website, and we observe the following data sent from JSTag:
Based on the data from the event, we might consider some of the following mappings:
To create a mapping visitMappingsunder theSchematab in the main navigation at the left of your window. Here you will find a list of all current mapping definitions. Clicking on+ Create Newwill enter the mapping creation wizard.

The mapping creation wizard has a single step where you will define a few parameters related to your new mapping.

Since mappings depend on the data available to a stream, monitoring that things are working as desired is important. For instance, if a key changes or stops streaming entirely, it may negatively impact your profiles and, ultimately, your marketing efforts. As such, the mapping summary view is available to review the health of mappings and provide a path for editing mappings in the future if necessary.
Sometimes you may want to remove a mapping from your schema altogether. This can be done from the mapping summary pictured above. Simply click the menu with three docs to the right ofEdit Mappingand you will be presented with a sub-menu. This menu contains aDeleteoption.

Paragraphs:
Lytics Conductor supports numerous built-in functions for light data transformation and logic evaluation to allow users to map only data that is relevant to their customer profile and format it the way they need for activation of their use cases.
For more complex data transformation and aggregation we suggest utilizing Cloud Connect (with or without Lytics Warehouse) for bringing in calculated attributes.
Mapping Keys vs. Literals
To map the data value passed in an event you will want to use the associated key within the Expression. When creating mappings it is important to remember that keys need to be wrapped in single backticks (``).
Literals (which can be a string, int, float, bool, or timestamp) are used to map a static value to the field. These are often used with conditionals.
Conditions allow you perform logical evaluations to determine when to store a value on a field based on any of the data passed within the same incoming event.
Merge OperatorsMerge operators allow you to determine how a value will be written to a field in relation to the currently stored value.
Data TypesKind = "int" | "number" | "string" | "date" | "[]string" |"ts[]string" | "map[string]int" | "map[string]number" | "map[string]string*
This example showcases the default mapping for themo_email_unsubfield from the Marketo Activity import.  Here we see we are writing count over time in which we seeactivityTypeIdas a key in the incoming event data.   However, we are only writing this expressions results when that incoming event data evaluates the conditioneq(activityTypeId, "9")astrue.
These functions are used to manipulate string fields.
Join together multiple values, coerce them into strings. Last argument is which string to use to join (may be empty string).
Breaking down the Example
Thejoin()function takes at minimum 2 arguments (utilizing the LAST argument as the "joining" string), and concatenates each argument in order utilizing the "joining" string.  In this example we produce a single string consisting ofstreet,city,statevalues concatenated utilizing the "joining" string,(comma followed by a space).
Length (of array, string) find the length of a string, return integer value of length.
Breaking down the Example
Thelen()function here is operating on a field whose value is an array, so the output is the number of items in the array. Applyinglen()to a string results in the character length of the string.
Choose value from the first field that has a non nil (empty string""inclusive) value.
Breaking down the Example
Thisoneof()function first checks and sees that theaccount_nofield does not exist in the event data, so then moves to theaccount_idwhich is found to be a non nil value and is returned.

Converts the value to a string and then replaces the matching part of a string with another string. If no replacement string is passed or an empty string is passed the matched string is simply removed.
Breaking down the Example
Usingpathfinds the path of the url which is "/parks-and-recreation".
The innerreplacefinds all parts of the string that matches "/" and since there is no specified string replacement "/" is replaced with nothing. This results in a value of "parks-and-recreation"
The outerreplace()takes the resulting "parks-and-recreation" and finds all of the parts of the string that matches "-" and replaces with a space (" "). Leading to the final value of "parks and recreation"
Breaks a variable into smaller fragments given a specific delimiter
Breaking down the Example
Thesplit()splits the incoming value associated with thefavorite-genreskey at each of the "|" characters the value contains.
Becausesplit()will split the value into fragments that are stored as an array, you will need to map it to a field that is a set data type ([]stringor[]time) and you will also want to wrapset()(for strings) ortotimeset()(for datetimes) around the function.
The order of a set of strings resulting from thesplitfunction will be alphabetical. The order of a set of datetimes resulting from thesplitfunction will be oldest to latest. However, if you use an array.index function to pull out a value based on position, the originally passed order will be referenced.
Strip removes leading and trailing whitespace (spaces, tabs, newline, carriage-return) from strings, or arrays of strings.
Breaking down the Example
Thesplit()function splits the incoming value associated with thefavorite-sub-genreskey at each of the "|" characters the value contain. In this example it will create 4 strings that are stored in an array output alphabetical order.
Thestrip()function then removes the leading and trailing spaces around each of the strings within the array.
Convert strings to lower case
Breaking down the Example
Thestring.lowercase()function looks at each character in the string value and converts to the lowercase equivalent.
Convert strings to upper case
Breaking down the Example
Thestring.uppercase()function looks at each character in the string value and converts to the uppercase equivalent.
Convert strings to title case
Usingstring.titlecase()only operates on the first character of each "word" in the string, and thus will always require that you first convert the string to lowercase usingstring.lowercase()for the full traditional titlecase conversion.
Breaking down the Example
Using thestring.lowercase()will first normalize the incoming string by converting it to lowercase.
Wrapping thestring.titlecase()will then convert the string into title case.
Find position of substring within a string, return ordinal starting position.
Breaking down the Example
string.index()utilizes a '0' based index, so the first character in the string is at index0, and the "1" being the second character in the string is at index1
Extract a string from a string using positional start/end.
Breaking down the Example
string.substr()utilizes a '0' based index and returns the substring of the provided string, starting at the provided start index up to but not including the end index.  The end index is optional here, and will return from the start index through the remainder of the string.
Does this value contain this string?  Is a sub-string match, not full match (eq)
Breaking down the Example
Thecontains()function takes 2 arguments, the field (or raw string) to be searched, and the substring to search for.  In this example the value for thestringExamplefield is searched for the substring "string", and being found returns the boolean valuetrue
Does this value start with this string?
Breaking down the Example
Thehasprefix()function takes 2 arguments, the field (or raw string) to be searched, and the substring to check for a match starting at index 0 of the 1st argument.  In this example the value for thestringExamplefield is checked for the substring "This is a string", and being found to match as the prefix returns the boolean valuetrue
Does this value end with this string?
Breaking down the Example
Thehassuffix()function takes 2 arguments, the field (or raw string) to be searched, and the substring to check for a match to end the 1st argument.  In this example the value for thestringExamplefield is checked for the substring "as an example", and being found to match as the suffix returns the boolean valuetrue
You can apply hash functions to encode incoming data.
Hash the given value using sip hash to integer output.
Hash the given value using md5.
Hash the given value using sha1.
Hash the given value using sha256.
Hash the given value using sha512.
base64 encode.
base64 decode.
These functions allow you to cast and convert data into different types.note: fortodateconversion, see the Date / Time section below.
Converts strings to integers. Useful for converting a string to a number before applying a number-based expression
Breaking down the Example
Here we have a summation function applying to the result of converting two different string fields toint(s) and wrapping them in thesum()function. We first convert the value forstringOne="1.7"into it'sintequivalent1, then convert the value forstringTwo="2"into it'sintequivalent2... then the summation result of the twointvalues is3
Converts string to numbers. Useful for converting a string to a number while needing to keep decimal precision
Breaking down the Example
Here we have a summation function applying to the result of converting two different string fields tonumber(s) and wrapping them in thesum()function. We first convert the value forstringOne="1.7"into it'snumberequivalent1.7(keeping decimal precision), then convert the value forstringTwo="2"into it'snumberequivalent2... then the summation result of the twonumbervalues is3.7
Casts to boolean:Numeric Values of 0/1 convert tofalse/truerespectivelyString Values will convert as:
These functions manipulate map or set fields.note: for thelenfunction see the String function listed above
Filter out values that match the specified criteria
Breaking Down the Example
Thisfilter()operates on top of the array built bysplit()'ing andstrip()'ing thesliceField.  Once we have our base array, we then apply the filter"bl*"(in which*is a wildcard) to match the "blue" value and filter it OUT of the array (returning an array including all the unmatched values)
Create an object/map of key-value pairs.   Often used to keep map of key (event-name?) to value  (last occurrence date?).  Or other user level key-value pair data.
Match a key, and then keep a map of key/values with the match value removed.
Breaking Down the Example
Thematch()function here looks for all keys prefixed with "example_", and finding 3 results, creates a map of key (key suffix) -> value pairs from those results utilizing the suffix of the original keys  to write to the map.
Given a map, return a list of strings consisting of the keys from the map
Breaking Down the Example
Themapkeys()function here utilizing the result of thematch()statement as it's input map, and returns a list consisting of the keys from that map.
Given a map, return a list of the values (as strings)
Breaking Down the Example
Themapvalues()function here utilizes the result of thematch()statement as it's input map, and returns a string list consisting of the values from that map.
Given a map, return a map of typemap[string]string, inverting the keys/values from the initial map
Breaking Down the Example
Themapinvert()function here utilizes the result of thematch()statement as it's input map, and returns a map (map[string]string) with each key-> value pair inverted (value->key).
Cherry pick a single item out of an array
Breaking Down the Example
Thearray.index()function utilizes a 0 indexed array to cherry pick the requested indexes value, in this case 0 being the first indexed item returns "apples".
Slice an array of items selecting some subset of them
Breaking Down the Example
For this example thearray.slice()function takes 3 parameters (the 3rd being optional), and returns an array consisting of the subset of the initial array (1st parameter) beginning at the start index (2nd parameter) up to, but not including, the end index (3rd parameter, if not provided then it defaults to the end of the input array). Reminder that these functions utilize 0 indexed arrays, so the index of1is actually the 2nd item in the array.
These functions manipulate strings which are URLs or email addresses.
Extract email address from "Bob <[email protected]>" format, note that the extracted email addresses are converted to lowercase and checked to ensure the existence of@symbol as well.
Breaking Down the Example
In this example theemail()function first extracts the email address of "[email protected]" from the input (this input can be in the the simplified input already, and will then just apply the second part of the function). Once we have the email address, the function then performs a lowercase operation and checks to ensure the presence of an@symbol. This check is fairly rudimentary and may change to provide stricter validation in the future.
ExtractBobfromBob <[email protected]>
Extractgmail.comfrom "Bob <[email protected]>" or[email protected]
Checks if URL string is valid and returns URL if true
Removes the query string and scheme from the url
Breaking Down the Example
Theurlmain()function here strips the leading scheme ("https://") and query string parameters ("?qsparam=p1&qsp2=param2") from the provided url.
Extract domain from URL
Extract host from URL
Extract the URL path from the URL
Perform URL decoding on a field. (my%20value->my value)
Breaking Down the Example
With this example ofurldecode()we want to decode the "spaced" query parameter value.  To do this we first extract the parameters' value utilizing theqs()function, returning "this%20is%20spaced".  We then proceed to use theurldecode()function to convert the "%20" to " ", and have our decoded string of "this is spaced".
Removes a specific query parameter and it's value from a URL
Extract the query string parameter from URL
Breaking Down the Example
Here theqs()function attempts to find the requested query string parameter in the URL and returns it if found.  It's important to note here that this function inherently lowercases the URL provided BEFORE attempting to match the query string, whereqs2()will search the raw URL provided without lowercasing.  Effectivelyqs(url, param)==qs2(tolower(url), param)
Extract a querystring parameter without lowercasing the URL before checking for the parameter
Extract info from user-agent string.
Below examples based onMozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.11 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/23.0.1271.97 Safari/537.11
These functions manipulate date fields. Our coreDate Parserrecognizes about 50 date formats, so in general these will operate onanyformat.If you are using EU dates, you will need to specify the parser format.
The current message/event times.
Breaking Down the Example
The event in question contains no attribution defining the date/time of the event, and therefore is processed utilizing the current time as the datetime for the event (The time of this example being "2024-11-18T17:51:21.483775672Z").
Unix MS of the date stamp on the current message being processed
Breaking Down the Example
Similar to thenow()function, theepochms()function uses the current event's timestamp to produce a result.  This time however, we return it's representation as the integer unix seconds (UTC) format.
Converts strings to dates whiles specifying a location / timezone.We still convert back to UTC for storage
Convert date(time) to Integer Unix Seconds (UTC)
Used to extract parts of a date(time). Example usage on thestrftimesite
Date conversion to YY format, so May 1 2014 is expressed as 14.   yy(dob), or yy() for record time stamp
String The YYMM date format, so May 1 2014 is expressed as 1405.
Date conversion to Integer month value (alias formonthofyear)
Seemm
Integer representation of the day of the week. (0-6, 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, etc.)
0-167 Integer representing the hour of the week (12:00-12:59am || 00:00:00-00:59:59 on Sunday is 0 hour)
Hour of day (12:00-12:59am || 00:00:00-00:59:59 = 0)
The Integer number of seconds in a give time (works with datetime as well as (MM:SS)
There are a variety of expressions for building document type structures (maps, lists, sets). These are functional expressions but can only be used in Columns.
Count of # of occurrences of the specified key
Count of # of occurences of each value for a specific key (stored as a map[value]count)
Summation of values for a specified key over time
Minimum numeric value seen for the specified key over time
Maximum numeric value seen for the specified key over time
Create a unique list/array of each value seen for this key over time
These functions are used for local evaluation (often as conditional statements), and return boolean values (true/false).
Checks a list of values (or keys' values), and returnstrueif ALL those values (or keys' values) are non zero-values (keys that are missing from incoming data will result in a false return here).
Similar toall(), except only requires one of the given parameters to evaluate to true'ish (not a zero-value) for the result to betrue
Checks for the existence of a key (or a passed value), and confirms the value (if exists) is not the empty string.
Checks for equality
Inverse ofeq()
Checks if the first argument isless thanthe second
Checks if the first argument isless than OR equal tothe second.
Checks if the first argument isgreater thanthe second.
Checks if the first argument isgreater than OR equal tothe second.
Returns the inverse of a boolean valuation (not(false)==true)
Checks ifis in the supplied value list

LQL (Lytics Query Language) is a proprietary query language developed by Lytics that allows users to cleanse, filter, and define the relationship between independent sources of data to materialize a unified consumer profile. This document outlines how to review, maintain, and create complex LQL queries.
With the introduction of Conductor all core data mapping functionality is now available directly in the UI. LQL is still available via API for technical users looking to automate process or manage fields an mappings in bulk but the vast majority of day-to-day users may benefit from diving deeper into Conductor.
The Browse Queries section in Lytics lets you see the Lytics Query Language (LQL) used in your account. To view this on your Lytics dashboard, navigate toData>Queries. From there, you can click on any item in the table to view an individual LQL file.

This is useful if you need to find out the exact definition of a specific user field and cannot access your LQL directly. Remember that you can't edit or remove LQL from the Lytics UI. For a more detailed breakdown of LQL and how it works, see the full article onQueries & LQL.
The Lytics Query Language (LQL) is used to define the transformation of uploaded records and event data intouser fieldson a customer profile. It transforms row-level event data into document-oriented user info. This Query language is similar to the HIVE or SQL query languages. However, it departs from these to offer more of aRich Document(JSON user profile) construction. The following section will explain how to write, validate, and upload queries using LQL.
The following is a simple example of an LQL file that translates events from a website into profile fields.
Once you have written your LQL file, you can save it with the.lqlextension. And use the following request to validate the query using the Lytics API.
You can upload your query to your account if it is valid..
To look at the user schema generated from the LQL:
There a few common keywords used in LQL syntax:
Use the following reference for a full syntactical guide when writing your own LQL:
LQL has many built-in functions for transformation and logic evaluation that can be applied to raw fields in LQL.
There are a variety of expressions for building document type structures (maps, lists, sets). These are functional expressions but can only be used in Columns.
These functions are used for local evaluation, and return boolean values (true/false).
These functions are used to manipulate string fields.
You can apply hash functions to encode incoming data.
These functions allow you to cast and convert data into different types.
These functions manipulate map or set fields.
These functions manipulate strings which are URLs or email addresses.
These functions manipulate date fields. Our core date parser recognizes about 50 date formats, so in general these will operate onanyformat.If you are using EU dates, you will need to specify the parser format.
TheKINDsyntax allows you to explicitly define the data type of a field. Often this is optional as it is inferred from functional expression.
TheMERGEOPsyntax allows you to define merge behavior, that is, do you want to keep new incoming values or values from previous events? In the UI, you will only see the mergeops that will be valid for the data type.

Paragraphs:
Identity ranks in Lytics are critical to the platform's identity resolution capabilities. In Lytics, a user's identity is based upon many unique identifiers that are used to connect data across different sources. This allows businesses to comprehensively view the user's behavior and preferences, which can be used to create targeted and personalized marketing campaigns.
Identity ranks provide a way to emphasize one identifier over the other in the case of conflicts or uncertainties during the stitching or independent events into a profile.
Lytics makes managing ranks easy. Press the up or down arrow for a specific identifier to move it up or down in the list.

Altering ranks without a clear intent can cause unexpected outcomes. When managing ranks it is always best to consult with your primary technical contact at Lytics.

Since mappings occur within Lytics' real-time profile pipeline, mappings will only be applied to data that passes through the pipeline and will not be retroactively applied to historical data.  For information on creating profile attributes with data outside of Lytics collection APIs.

Publishing changes is easy. You can first determine if there are any unpublished changes to your schema by visiting theVersionsunder theSchemamenu in the main navigation within Conductor. There you will see a summary of your version history and the number of unpublished changes.
If you have unpublished changes, click on thePublish Changesbutton to review those changes and ultimately publish when ready.
Once you have opted to publish the changes, you will be asked to complete a final review. This review will outline the changes tofields,mappings, andrankings. On the final step, you'll have an opportunity to provide a description to associate with the version and ultimately publish. This ensures any changes have a clear history and reduces any change of accidental schema changes.
If you determine that you would like to discard all the current unpublished changes to the schema, click on theDiscard Changesbutton. This will open a dialog box that will confirm that you wish to reset the schema to the last published version. Select theDiscard Changesbutton to discard all changes.
If you would like to remove the changes you published in your most recent schema version(s), navigate to the version you would like to return your schema to and click theRevert to Schemabutton.
This will create a new unpublished version that contains all the changes needed to return all the fields, mappings and ranks back to the state of the desired schema version. Your will then need to publish these changes in order to complete the reversion.

Paragraphs:
The Lytics schema visualization tool lets users visualize the relationships between data fields and data sources within the Lytics platform. The visualization provides a graphical representation of the data schema, making it easier for users to understand the structure of their data and how it is connected.
With the schema visualization, users can:
Overall, the Lytics schema visualization provides a powerful tool for understanding the data structure within the Lytics platform, enabling users to gain deeper insights and make more informed decisions about their data strategy.

The Schema Audit provides an overview of how your user fields are being used, the data they contain, and where they are getting that data. It is a great way to see if you have user fields that don't have any data or are not being used for any audience.
On your Lytics dashboard, navigate toData>Schema Audit. This section offers a snapshot of your data to verify your data mapping techniques.
By default, the Schema Audit includes all user fields in your account. You can filter the report in three different ways.

Users with fieldallows you to filter fields based the percentage of users in your account who have a user field. For example, if you chooseAt least 50%, the Schema Audit will be filtered to include only user fields found on 50% or more of the profiles in your account.
Data streamallows you to filter the Schema Audit based on the data source of a user field. Remember that a user field may receive data from multiple data streams.
Search boxallows you to search for a specific user field by name.
The visualizations near the top of the report tell you how user fields are used in your Lytics account. You can click on one of the visualizations to filter the table below.

The first pie chart shows the percentage of user fields that are providing data to build profiles from. In the example above, only 40% of user fields provide data to profiles. That means the other 60% of user fields have no data at all. This number should be as close to 100% as possible.
The second pie chart shows the percentage of user fields that are being used to define audiences. In this example, 94% of user fields are not being used to define any audience.  This account probably mapped too much data, and could trim down their LQL quite a bit.
The third pie chart shows how many user fields are merging data from multiple streams. A common example of merging data from multiple streams is anemailuser field. Typically, this may read data from your website as well as an email tool. One of Lytics' core competencies is merging data from different sources, so be sure to take advantage of this when creating your user fields.
The distribution bar along the bottom of this section shows you what type of user fields are in your account. Certain types of user fields, especially any containingmap, are more expensive and should be used carefully. Mouse over the slices of the distribution bar to see how many user fields of each type are in your account.

Browse the table to find detailed information about a specific user field. Select theList audiences each field usescheckbox to expand the table and see any audience that contains a user field in its definition.
If you have questions about the user fields on your Schema Audit, contact your Lytics customer success representative for more information.

Paragraphs:
Lytics profiles enjoy access to both auniversal schema, which provides computed, intelligent attributes on every profile in Lytics, as well as acommon schema, a set of standard attributes that facilitates faster integration and more reliable consistency when integrating profiles to and from other systems.
GrowthandEnterpriseLytics accounts may also customize their schema with additional fields and mappings.
Lytics' universal schema delivers a set of intelligent attributes that areuniversal to every profilethat gets created, regardless of data source, age, or their anonymous or known status.
These attributes include rich behavioral models, AI-derived interests, and identity resolution metadata, leading to more comprehensive insights on all of your profiles.  (Not just the known ones!)
Universal attributes provide a common vocabulary with which to think about how you might engage with each and every individual — what they're interested in, what their engagement has been, or how they're likely to engage in the future.
Identifiers in Lytics Schema serve to stitch profiles together. For instance, if you pass anemailalong with the _uid, all events that have only been associated with either identifier will be merged into a single comprehensive profile.
Default identifiers are listed below.  Some jobs in your data pipeline may add new identifiers to your schema, likeshopify_customer_idorsalesforce_contact_ids.
Metafields encompass all system-level information that provides insights into the health and breadth of the profile. This includes data such as creation date, last update timestamp, source information, and other metadata associated with the profile's management and maintenance. Metafields offer a behind-the-scenes view of the profile's overall status and administration.
Behavioral attributes comprise a multidimensional set of scores that provide insight into an individual's behavior over time.
These insights are invaluable when personalizing experiences based on changes in behavior or behaviors indicative of high likelihood. For instance, you might want to present a premium offer to users exhibiting higher momentum than usual.
Behavioral attributes enable targeted and timely interventions tailored to user actions and patterns.
Interests entail understanding the topics a user is interested in based on their interactions, cross-referenced by deep programmatic analysis of their online activities. This allows for tailored content recommendations and targeted messaging aligned with the user's preferences and engagement history.
Attributes classified as intelligence encompass diverse, highly valuable information to facilitate relevant and high-value personalized experiences. Within this category, you'll discover real-time segment membership, values crucial for split testing and experimentation, and direct correlation to our real-time machine learning modeling. These attributes empower dynamic and data-driven decision-making, enhancing the efficacy of personalized marketing strategies.
Random splits are assigned by algorithmic hashing and result in an even distribution across profiles.
There are 100 possible splits (0-99), so creating an audience where_split = 44would result in a random subset of 1% of profiles.  A random split where_split < 50would result in a subset of 50% of profiles.
Having access to two random split assignments allows you to target 100*100, or 10k different subsets of your audiences.
This means you can create splits that are capable of targeting down to 0.01% of profiles.
Lytics' SegmentML models provide scores for modeling custom outcomes in Lookalike models.  Each active model attaches a score (between 0 and 1) to a profile with its name.
Similar tosegment_predictionvalues, the percentiles provide the ability to create audiences and target users based on theirpercentileinstead of their raw score.  This enables you, for example, to create audiences of users with the top 10% of scores (by usingsegment_prediction_percentile > 90).
Commonfieldshelp to structure your profiles in a way for developers to easily plug into them, and for marketers to easily use them in personalization.
Commonmappingshelp to translate your source data into a format that can be used by common fields.
These fields and mappings help to provide consistency in your profiles, regardless of the source from which the data came.
For example, your CRM might have"tax_exempt": "true", while your data warehouse might has"tax_status": "exempt", and your ESP might have"is_tax_exempt": 1.  In Lytics' Common Schema, this would simply be represented as"tax_exempt": true.
For your convenience, Jobs managed in your Data Pipeline will automatically create schema fields and mappings to implement Lytics Common Schema in your data so that you can get to more use cases more quickly with ourInspiration Library.
Some fields, likename, are automatically part of every Lytics account.
Other channel-specific fields will be added when you add channel-specific data sources to your account. For example, adding a Shopify import job to your data sources would add the common schema fieldpurchase_total, among others.
Identifiers in Lytics Schema serve to stitch profiles together. For instance, if you pass anemailalong with the _uid, all events that have only been associated with either identifier will be merged into a single comprehensive profile.
Default identifiers are listed below.  Some jobs in your data pipeline may add new identifiers to your schema, likeshopify_customer_idorsalesforce_contact_ids.
An individual's email address is automatically standardized (syntactically validated and lower-cased) so as to be compatible as an identifier in your identity graph.
The SHA256 hash of an individual's email address.  In the event that your account has an email address present, the hash is automatically computed so as to be compatible with external systems that require the SHA256 hash for integration.  In the event that you don't want any PII in your account, you can pass the hash directly instead of the raw address.
Optional, and if provided, this will usually come from your proprietary, first-party database.  This will be used for profile stitching and should therefore be unique to an individual.
Interests entail understanding the topics a user is interested in based on their interactions, cross-referenced by deep programmatic analysis of their online activities. This allows for tailored content recommendations and targeted messaging aligned with the user's preferences and engagement history.
A history of an individual's most recently visited URLs, helpful for powering Lytics' Interest Engines. A siphash of each URL's sanitized value (without query parameters) is used to index the map.
hashedurlsare used in Lytics' standard Interest Engine, but you can create additional Interest Engines with other sets of URLs, product IDs, or atomic content IDs from your CMS.
Attributes classified as intelligence encompass diverse, highly valuable information to facilitate relevant and high-value personalized experiences. Within this category, you'll discover real-time segment membership, values crucial for split testing and experimentation, and direct correlation to our real-time machine learning modeling. These attributes empower dynamic and data-driven decision-making, enhancing the efficacy of personalized marketing strategies.
The "needs message" score evaluates how likely an individual is to engage on a channel without any messaging.
A higher score would indicate that an individual is less likely to return within a typical engagement window (relative to other individuals in a data stream).  A lower score would indicate that they are more likely to return within a typical engagement window.
Details encompass all default attributes related to user demographics and general information, including name, phone number, status, etc. It serves as a catch-all for attributes not specifically tied to interactions or behaviors.
An individual's name may take a few forms, depending on the source, and this field may sometimes be just the first name, a combination of names, or completely empty.
Geolocation attributes are inferred from geolocation on network activity.
Device attributes describe the devices that have been associated with an individual and their activity.
This may be a Google Advertising ID (GAID) or an Apple Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA).
These may be a Google Advertising ID (GAID) or an Apple Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA).
While not a default part of your identity graph, this field may be promoted to an identifier to perform identity stitching.  This should be performed with caution as it is not guaranteed to be unique and can result in stitching individuals with similarly configured browser.
An individual's locale is usually a combination of an individual's language code and country code.
An individual's language code, standardized by ISO-639-1 two-letter codes.
User Attributes are helpful for storing custom attributes about an individual without having to create and map additional user fields.
Form Data is helpful for storing custom form data from an individual without having to create and map additional user fields.

Paragraphs:
Schema Copilot revolutionizes how users manage data connections, streamlining the integration process with our Customer Data Platform (CDP), Lytics.
Before starting this document, it is important to understand some key fundamentals regarding fields and mappings, which can be foundhere.
Integrating custom data into Lytics is simplified into two straightforward steps:
Schema Copilot leverages advanced generative artificial intelligence to comprehensively scrutinize your new data source. It offers intuitive suggestions for fields and mappings, enabling seamless integration of your new data source with the existing schema. This intelligent assistance ensures that your data aligns perfectly with the Lytics platform, enhancing your customer data integration's overall efficiency and accuracy.
To get started with Schema Copilot:
Navigate to the Schema Copilot wizard.
Fill out the "Provide Data" box with an example of your data source's data, either JSON or CSV. In the "Additional Prompt" box, you can also give the model more directives.
JSON Example
Tip:If you do not correctly input the JSON, you will see an error message on the red banner.
CSV Example
Select the stream from which the data is going to be coming in.
(Optional)If you would like to have more complex data types or only map data in certain conditions you can do that using the "Additional Prompt Box"
Example of Adding a prompt based on the CSV file input:
Now, on the email mapping for the default stream, you will see a condition that requires the first name to exist.
Click "Suggest Schema" and review the suggestions in the editable data grid. If you want to accept the suggestions, click "Save Schema." If you don't, you can return to the first step to change your data or prompt or exit the wizard entirely.
Understanding the Suggested Schema View:
Field rows will have the following columns:

Paragraphs:
When data from multiple sources are combined into a single user profile, it is essential to ensure that the resulting data is accurate and consistent. Merge statistics in Lytics provide a way to monitor and optimize the merging process, ensuring that the data is adequately combined and reflects the most up-to-date and accurate information.
In the example below, you can see how merge stats can be used to uncover potential areas of issue. Out of the four available identifiers, user_id, is not responsible for any merges. This could be due to several reasons, such as no data populating that field, the relationship being defined inaccurately, etc.

Merge Statistics
Crawling: https://docs.lytics.com/docs/identity-explorer
Paragraphs:
The Identity Explorer is a powerful feature within the Lytics platform, crafted to offer you an extensive and thorough examination of an individual user's Customer 360 (C360) profile. This tool not only improves your capacity to comprehend the composition of a user's profile from diverse sources but also grants access to a wealth of attributes and insights associated with the user.
The Identity Explorer is organized into several key sections, each offering a unique perspective into the consumer:
In the "Identity" section, you can explore the relationships between unique identifiers that establish connections across the various channels the consumer engages with. The "Identifier List" provides a detailed overview of the keys and values used for linking, while the "Identity Graph" visually represents these relationships. This section helps you understand how the consumer is identified and linked across platforms.
The "Profile Fields" section encompasses an exhaustive catalog (feature store) of attributes along with their corresponding values linked to the customer's profile. This encompasses default schema fields from connected tools, custom attributes, and many inferred or machine learning-based attributes generated by Lytics. This section offers an expansive overview of the consumer's data, facilitating precise targeting and personalized interactions.
The "Profile Fields" view can be filtered by either typing in a query or selecting any combination of pre-built filters. We find it most effective to filter by the field categories to simplify the view during exploration.
For developers and data enthusiasts, the "Raw Data" section offers a JSON representation of the complete profile.
In the "Behavior" section, you'll find a graphical representation of Lytics' ninebehavioral scores. These scores offer valuable insights into the user's engagement patterns across channels, helping you tailor marketing strategies and campaigns to their preferences.
The "Content Affinity" section provides a graphical representation of product and content-based affinity scores for the user. It reveals the user's preferences and interests, enabling you to make data-driven recommendations and content suggestions.
The "Activity" section overviews the user's activity over time. You can track when they are most active and identify the best times to communicate with them. This historical data helps optimize the timing of your interactions for maximum engagement.
In support of GDPR Profile Administrators may also delete a single profile or download the profile data to provide to a consumer directly if requested.

Paragraphs:
Cloud Connect tabs are found underData Pipeline>Cloud Connect. Connections configure the access to your data warehouses, and Data Models configure the SQL queries that are run to connect audience membership and profile attributes.
Click+ Create New Connectionfrom the Connections Dashboard at the top right and complete the following steps.
The authorization selected for your Connection will control your Lytics account users' access to your data warehouse. You can control whether a user has read access to the entire dataset or individual tables, maintaining your security and governance practices within your data warehouse.
Cloud Connect currently supports a number of popular data warehouses:
Once you have created a Connection, you can access a summary page showing how data from your data warehouse is being leveraged in Lytics. At the top of the page, you’ll see the following information:
The rest of the Summary tab shows how many active and inactive data models are built using this Connection as a data source and how many tables are accessible from this dataset. The Activity chart displays how many rows are being queried, which can have cost implications based on your data warehouse usage.
The Explore tab provides a simple Schema Explorer to validate that the data shown is as you would expect to see in your data warehouse. In the example below, we only connected an individual table, but here you will see as many tables as the authorization has read access to.
The Details section displays all the information about setting up your Connection, including the authorization and configuration settings.
The Logs section records the history of events for this Connection, which are helpful to ensure your connection is working as expected. Below are the connection event types you may see.

Paragraphs:
A Data Model is used by Cloud Connect to link or "connect" a user's external data warehouse to Lytics profiles. Each Data Model represents a set of records defined by a SQL query. Each Data Model will also configure a join key which defines how the Data Model is joined to Lytics Profiles.
Once a Connection to your data warehouse has been created, Data Models can be created via theData Modelstab within the navigation bar:
Click+ Create Newfrom the Data Models dashboard and complete the following steps.
Select the Connection.
Write the SQL query.Query Editor: Write and test standard SQL queries directly in Lytics. Alternatively, copy and paste queries you've tested in your BigQuery or Snowflake instance. When you clickTest Query, Lytics will return 10 sample records.
Test the query and validate the results.
When building multiple Cloud Connect Data Models with the same primary key, you must select the same External Lytics Key mapping. Selecting a different Lytics key will result in an error when you try to save the new Data Model.
Consider this scenario to demonstrate why you'd want to create a Cloud Connect Data Model driven audience instead of a standard Lytics audience. Your company sells e-bikes and wants to run a holiday campaign that sends a promotion to any customer who purchased an e-bike in November or December last year. Perhaps you also want to refine your audience to those who are interested in particular bike brands. All of this purchase and product data already exists in your Google BigQuery instance (as shown below).

Instead of directly importing all that purchase history data into Lytics, you can write a SQL query to find which customers meet this audience criteria. By copying this query directly into the Lytics Model Builder (as shown in the generate a query screenshot above), you'll create a new audience in Lytics that will be updated on the frequency interval you decide.
Once the Data Model is activated, profiles will be updated with a membership field that can be used to create an audience. Activated fields can be added to the Data Model that can then be used for more dynamic audiences.
If you would like to skip having to write a SQL query, simply describe the Data Model of what you wish to fetch and using GenAI, Lytics will translate the description to a SQL query for you. Lytics makes queries to your database to ensure that the data is up to date and accurate when creating the query.

Example Use Case
SQL Translator
Crawling: https://docs.lytics.com/docs/leveraging-cloud-connect-audiences
Paragraphs:
Because the queries that power your Cloud Connect Data Models can have costs associated with your database usage, Lytics doesn’t run the scheduled sync automatically.
After you've created a new Cloud Connect Data Model, you'll notice that the Status is listed as Inactive:
In order to activate, click theActivatebutton on the Data Model page:
Once you click theActivatebutton, your query will complete its first run within an hour of theNext Sync Ontimestamp listed under the Details tab and then continue to run at the interval you selected. During each sync, the SQL query will be run against your database, and your Lytics profiles will be updated according to the configuration defined on the Data Model.
Once synced, theTotal Recordsmetric on the Data Model summary tab may take up to 2 hours to display. This number represents the number of rows returned by the SQL query.
Upon activation of a Data Model, Lytics will automatically create one customer profile field which represents the membership of a user for the Data Model. Additional fields will be created if the Data Model was configured to include Activated Fields. Below is a guide for how to locate these generated fields within a customer profile or within the Audience Builder (on theCustom Fieldstab)
If you need to disable a Cloud Connect Data Model from syncing at any point, you can do so by navigating to the Data Model and clicking theDeactivatebutton.
Deactivating the Data Model will not remove its corresponding fields from schema or from Lytics profiles; however, it will cause the values for these fields to become out of date. In order to completely remove the fields from schema/profiles, the Data Model must be deleted.
Throughout the app, you may see different metrics for Cloud Connect Data Models.
On the summary page for your Cloud Connect Data Model, under theTotal Recordsstatistic (shown in the graph below), you will see the number of records that are selected by the query based on the unique number of primary keys in the origin database. This may be equal to or less than the number of total rows imported and may be significantly higher than the number you see in the audience builder when utilizing this Data Model.
When adding Cloud Connect Data Model membership or activated fields to audience logic in the Audience Builder, you may see a smaller size than theTotal Recordson the summary. The count of users within the Audience Builder is the number of users in your Lytics account who met the qualifications for the query based on the matching Lytics user field configured on the Data Model. This number reflects the number of records that would be included if you were to run an export of the audience.
Most common reasons for why this number may be smaller than theTotal Recordsmetric are the following:
Once activating a Data Model, its associated fields will be stored as user fields on the customer profile (to see the naming conventionhere) . Therefore, in order to export the members of the Data Model, you will first need tocreate an audiencein the Audience Builder. You can create an audience of only members or layer in additional audience rules to get the most out of your customer data.
For example, you could build a Cloud Connect audience using account-level data for a B2B use case and add one of Lytics behavioral scores to refine your targeting based on your desired user engagement level.
To learn how to export audiences, visit our Activating Audiences documentationhere.

Paragraphs:
A sync refers to the process of running SQL queries configured on Data Models against data warehouses and then updating Lytics profiles with any changes that have occurred since the previous sync.
Most of the time, yes. However, if an interruption occurs during the sync (either due to a processing or network error), we’ll attempt to resume the sync from the place where we left off. If that occurs, we’ll need to rerun the query.
On the Data Model Details page, we display two timestamps related to the sync for your Data Model: “Last Sync on” and “Next Sync On”. The “Last Sync On” timestamp displays the exact time when your Data Model was last synced. However, the timestamp shown for “Next Sync On” will vary slightly from the time when your model will actually sync.
In an effort to reduce the number of syncs needed, we set the “Next Sync On” timestamp in a way where more models will end up synced together. Then every hour, we check to see which models are ready to sync - if “Next Sync on” is in the past, we sync the model.
Ultimately, you should think of your selected sync frequency as the number of times per day your model will sync (e.g. a model with a sync frequency of four hours will sync six times per day). The “Next Sync on” timestamp gives an estimate as to when the next sync will occur rather than the exact time.
We use the columns returned by the SQL query to set up our internal schema. If no data is returned by the query, we don’t have the required information to correctly set up our schema. Note that once the schema is set up, your Data Model will continue to sync regardless of how many rows are returned.
Creating a Data Model modifies your Conductor schema - at a minimum, a true/false “membership” field will be added to denote whether a profile falls into that Data Model. In addition, one field is added for each activated field that’s selected. In order for these fields to be added, your Conductor schema cannot be in a draft state.
When updating a Data Model, we’ll attempt to update your Conductor schema if any activated fields are being changed. For this reason, if you try to edit your activated fields and your schema has unpublished changes, we’ll reject the update.
The UI allows for selecting any column that’s returned by your SQL query as your primary key. However, it’s important that the selected primary key field contain unique values. If there are duplicate values, we cannot guarantee that the values for your activated fields will be correct.
You should choose a field whose values will match to the values of an existing “by” field in your Lytics schema.
No; only “by” fields can be selected. Further, once a Data Model has been created for a certain primary key, all subsequent Data Models which use that primary key must also use that same Lytics key.
Cloud Connect requires that the column you use as the primary key of your data model queries be UTF-8 collated. If your column is collated differently, this can cause your data model syncs to fail. Most database providers allow columns to be converted to a particular collation within a query. If your primary key column is collated differently, consult the documentation of your database provider to ensure a compatible collation:

Sync Failures Related To Collation
Crawling: https://docs.lytics.com/docs/understanding-user-profiles
Paragraphs:
User profiles provide relevant insights about individual customers in relation to your entire customer base. Referencing a user profile helps answer questions about who your customers are and how they are engaging with your brand.
Initially, the user profile offers a way to test your Lytics implementation and validate the outcomes of your marketing tactics. For example, you can check if campaigns are working as expected by using a “test” persona and seeing how the user profile data gets updated.
As you get deeper into building campaigns, the user profile provides insight into how your marketing influences user behaviors. For example, if you run a mobile campaign, you can drill down to see if customers are engaging on mobile devices, what days and times they are most active, and what types of content they are affinity for. User profiles are updated in real-time, but there can be a delay while the data is being processed and scores are being calculated for behavior and content affinity.
To provide quick access to customer data, the user profile is divided into three tabs:Intelligence,Audiences, andDetails.
The intelligence tab gives a snapshot of key information about an individual user. At the top, a bar is displayed to help you quickly understand user engagement across all channels:Likelihood to re-engage,Current engagement level, andFrequency of user interactions.

Each of these boxes summarizes the data science-powered behavioral scores into practical terms. The individual behavior scores and the user’s content affinity are displayed below. This rich data based on a user’s actual behavior is available thanks to the predictive analytics built into Lytics.

This module gives an overview of which channels (email, web, mobile, etc.) an individual user has been active in. When appropriately mapped, it will also provide information on when users were active on each channel (within the last day or within the last 30 days).
NOTE: If this module is empty, please see below for details on how to configure the user fields. As with all data mapping exercises, it is best to include your Customer Success representatives for optimal results.
If you are customizing LQL or handling custom streams, it is important to understand how this module should be configured. For all our built-in integrations, Lytics includes this data mapping by default.
At its core, the "Recent activity by channel" module is built from a single user field. This field will not exist in legacy accounts and must be added to the existing LQL manually. For all new accounts that get the latest default LQL files, the baseline should be included.
In order to handle either custom data mapping for an account or backfill an old account, the user fieldlast_channel_activitiesmust be defined in a streams LQL file. This field is defined as amap[string]timeand should not be altered.
In each stream you'll simply map a string, such as "web" or "email" to a timestamp such asepochms()in order to update the field. A more lengthy example for an email LQL might look something like:
The example above is for when you only want to map the activity event in the case of a click or open. This definition will vary from stream to stream.
When it comes to which keys to use, we recommend following these standards for common channels:
Highlights the identifiers that have been used to materialize this particular user's profile.
The event chart shows a user’s activity by hour and day of the week. The top right of the chart highlights when a user is most active, for example Tuesdays at 10am.
This tab displays a list of all the current Audiences a user belongs to and the total size of each audience. Audiences include factual information such as “Has Email Address” and “Known Location” along with Lytics score-driven characteristics such as “Deeply Engaged” or “Binge User”.

The details tab gives an under-the-hood display of the exact user fields contributing to a user’s behavioral data and their audiences. Unique identifiers are shown first, which are essential for enabling cross-channel mapping. For all user fields, the associated stream and value is provided.

Some profiles may include a profile picture when viewed in the user interface. This image comes fromGravatar. If the profile in question has an email address, Lytics converts it to an MD5 hash. That hash is then used to look up the corresponding image on Gravatar. This image is only displayed in the Lytics UI and is not part of the profile itself.

Paragraphs:
Because Lytics user profiles are created by stitching data across sources the stability of a given profile depends on the quality and quantity of data used to create it. Lytics is now surfacing the "health" of user profiles to improve your account performance and reliability.
Healthy profilesare stable and actionable, with strong identifiers connecting data fragments across sources to the right user.
Unhealthy profilesare unstable and not actionable, as they are either missing entirely or missing a subset of data.
Lytics is providing visibility into user profile health to facilitate the resolution of various issues caused by unhealthy profiles, which can include missing data, inconsistent audience counts between Lytics and other tools, and duplicate profiles in audience exports/triggers.
A user profile is considered unhealthy if the traversal through all data fragments fails for any reason. Unhealthy profiles are mostly commonly hitting one of the following limitations:
Unhealthy profiles in Lytics are no longer processed for audience evaluations, audience exports or triggers, and enrichment processes, including behavioral scoring and content affinity calculations. Because unhealthy profiles are unusable in Lytics or any of your connected marketing tools, this change will reduce latencies and ensure that only valid user profiles are surfaced for activations.
Unhealthy profiles only contain unique identifiers (“by fields”) and meta fields such as profile size, an indication of why the profile is unhealthy, the data stream names, etc.
Lytics is not destroying or losing any data about your users. Rather, unhealthy profiles simply no longer surface the portion of a profile that can be retrieved as it may result in inaccurate audience counts and activations.
A new, predefined audience called "Unhealthy Profiles'' will be made available in all accounts. If user profiles become unhealthy, then we should see an increase in this audience at the same rate that we see a decrease in other audiences.
The only fields that we drop from the profiles when they become unhealthy are the non-"by fields." So an audience that only has conditions on those "by fields" will not be affected.
For example,Filter Exists emailwouldn't be affected, but the audienceFilter Exists emailANDState=WAwould be affected. The latter would be affected because Lytics will drop the state field for the unhealthy profiles.
Contact your Lytics Account Manager to discuss a strategy to resolve or reduce the number of unhealthy profiles. The approach will vary depending on your identity resolution strategy and the requirements of your marketing use cases.
Yes, the "Unhealthy Profiles" audience can be exported via BigQuery, SFTP or S3. However, unhealthy profiles cannot be exported to other provider tools for activations since they are excluded from the audience evaluation process.
User profiles become unhealthy by hitting one or more of the following limits.
“Max neighbors” refers to the number of edges associated with a node. A node is created in Lytics' graph when an identifier is introduced to a user profile.
Audience Impact: From an activation perspective, this means that what would have been one user profile in the audience is now increased to how many fragmented nodes there were.
Above is an example of when max neighbors could impact a profile. The profile on the left has one email and many web cookies. Each time a user gets a new web cookie and they are logged into the site, Lytics will update the graph with a new node. Over time, the node with an email will have more and more cookies associated with it until it hits the max neighbors limit. Once the profile hits max traversals, the email node will drop off. Then, instead of having one user profile in the Lytics audience builder, there will be as many profiles as there are fragmented nodes off the original (four in this example).
“Max Traversals” refers to the number of edges that need to be traversed in order to retrieve the user profile for the audience. Once this hits the limit specified on the account, the profile will no longer update.
Audience Impact: If a user hits max traversals, their profile will no longer be updated for audience building and will fall into a “stale state.” See the following examples:
If a user has opted out for emails and they hit max traversals, they will not be opted out even if the event is received to opt them out. They will be stuck in that audience unless the criteria changes and they no longer qualify.
If a user has opted out for an email and they do not qualify for the audience originally but eventually opt in, that will not be reflected on the profile in the audience builder.
When a profile becomes too large, it cannot be pulled in for audience building at all. At this point the profile is unusable.  There are a few different points in our pipeline which can trigger a profile to be marked unhealthy due to size:

Paragraphs:
Audiences are central to creating personalized marketing using Lytics. It is how groups of users get targeted and defines how cross-channel user data is used in campaigns. Lytics offers audiences as a tool that operates on user fields as well as other audiences. This provides the ability to craft audiences that target one user, every user, or any number in between.
Lytics audiences are automatically kept up to date. As time passes, an audience that once targeted 500 users may grow to target 10,000. This is great if your audience is targeting engaged users who have shown interest in your upcoming product, but not so great if your audience targets users with outstanding support tickets. Lytics makes it easy to find these insights so your campaign strategies can be adjusted accordingly.
Audiences can be used in Lytics Experiences, third-party ad campaigns, and tools like Google BigQuery for advanced reporting. When all of that isn’t enough, the Lytics APIs provide deep integrations with the Lytics platform.
Access the audience builder from Lytics navigation menu by expanding theAudiencestab and clickingAudiences. Once on the Audiences page, click on the+ Create New Audiencebutton.
Building new audiences allows you to target specific groups of your users. Why send the same email to your entire audience? Instead, send emails to distinct audiences with content that you know those users enjoy. Lytics gives you the ability to create audiences based on cross channel user data, behaviors and interests.
Audiences can be built using existing audiences, user content affinity, your personalization campaigns, or by custom rules utilizing any user fields in your Lytics account. Create rulesets by combining multiple audiences and boolean logic to target users with as much or as little granularity as you require.
Lytics updates your audiences automatically. Once an audience is built, users will join or leave whenever they match (or fail to match) the rules you have set. Export your audiences, often in real-time, to your integrated marketing tools giving you the power of Lytics however you engage with your users.
Access the audience builder from Lytics navigation menu by expanding theAudiencestab and clickingAudiences. Once on the Audiences page, click on the+ Create New Audiencebutton.
TheExisting Audiencestab in the audience builder contains a list of all existing audiences and their size categorized by audience type such as characteristic. Characteristics are pre-built audiences pertaining to single user attributes such as location or behavior.
Keep in mind that the audience sizes you see in this list arenotreal-time. They are updated every few hours for performance reasons. When creating or editing an audience, however, you will always see real-time numbers so that you can make precise decisions based on accurate data.
You can use theFilter by Audience Typedrop-down to filter the list or use theSearchbox to quickly find an audience by name.

Select an audience or characteristic to add it to the definition of the audience you are building or editing.

TheContent Affinitytab in the audience builder is used to add Affinity-based rules to your audience. SinceAffinitiesare agroup of related Topics, this allows you to effectively target users interested in several subjects or products.

In the example above, we created a "Lavender" Affinity for an online beauty store, which includes 6 Topics such as "lavender", "lavender lotion", and "lavender luxury." Instead of creating an audience with 6 rules (one per Topic), we just select our Lavender Affinity that contains those 6 Topics.
Once you choose an Affinity for your audience, you will be able to select the range of affinity values. The histogram displays the distribution of user interest for the selected Affinity and is helpful to build an audience that has the desired size. By default, users withAny Affinityare selected. You can choose a built-in range by clicking any of theAffinitybuttons or, to set a custom range, use the slider to refine the range of users to target. As you change the range, the total number of users that fit the range is shown in the right column.
As soon as you create an Affinity, Lytics start scoring users against it as they interact with your content or products. For active users, you can expect this number to start populating within a few days. For inactive users, it can take up to 2 weeks for them to be scored against an Affinity. So it's recommended that you create Affinities in advance of the audience needed for an Affinity-based campaign.
Under theCustom Ruletab in the Audience Builder, you can find the existing audiences based on Topics in your content taxonomy. If you want to create new audiences based on a single Topic, you can do so as follows:
Once you hit "Add Condition", the custom rule for a Topic will look like this:
Although Topics are still supported in the Audience Builder, we strongly recommend you use Affinities to build audiences for a more efficient workflow and more effective targeting.
Some users may find a field namedInferred Content Affinitywhen trying to build affinity or topic based audiences. This field contains topics that a user could be interested in even though they may not have interacted with the topics directly. To learn more about how these inferrences are made, you can read about ourcontent taxonomy process. Note that topic affinity already includes this information, but this field contains only inferred affinity. We would also recommend not using this field to build audiences as it is not a wholistic view of a user's affinity.
TheCustom Rulestab in the audience builder is used to add any rule based on auser fieldto the audience being built or edited.
Custom rules allow for ultimate access of all data that is aggregated in user fields. Custom rules are simple statements that can be combined to create very precise audiences. Using them correctly requires a thorough understanding of the data being used, but there is no replacement for this level of segmentation.
Audiences Field Value Limits
Audiences can have a maximum of 1,000 field values. "Values" in this context apply to a single evaluation against a user field.
When exceeded, the error message "Audience too large! Remove values to save this audience" will be displayed. For example, the following scenarios would trigger the alert:

The user field list displays all the fields in your account. TheSourcedrop-down can be used to filter on the data stream the user field came from. TheIncludesdrop-down can be used to filter user fields on the percentage of users that have a field. Use theSearchinput to search for a user field by name.
Generally, to add a Custom Rule to an audience definition:
There are variations to this general procedure based on thetypeof the user field and the operator chosen.
How you work with user fields in the Custom Rules tab will depend on way the field is mapped in on the user profile.

Numeric user fields are most commonly used for data that is counted. For instance, the number of times a visitor has been to a website or the number of times a subscriber has opened an email. Exact values can be matched, but more commonly, inequalities are expressed.
Examples:

Text User fields are commonly used for words and miscellaneous information. For instance, a user’s first name. Since there is no mathematical relationship between two text values, the operations used are generally exact match or partial match.
There are 5 operator options when making audiences with text user fields:
Examples

Date user fields are commonly used for any data that represents a point in time. For instance, the last time a user visited a website. Most commonly, a date is chosen to divide the people who fall before or after that date. You will need to select both your starting point and a directionin timefor your custom rule.
Your starting point could be a fixed point in time (useful for milestone events, like product launches) or a relative point in time (useful for scheduled follow ups).
Since each rule only handles going forward or backward from a single point in time, you may need to create two rules that work together to bound a range of time. One rule will capture all dates after the first point in time, and a second rule will capture all dates before a later point in time.
Some date fields have a natural boundary, such as Last Visits, which will never include a date in the future. If you want all Last Visits from a point in time up until now, you would only need to create one rule.
Examples




Set user fields are commonly used for collecting related data over time. For instance, all the URLs a user has visited. These fields are generally used much like text user fields, even though the data is structured differently.
Examples

Map user fields are used to add hierarchy to a dynamic domain of data. For instance,Events By Deviceis a count of all events, but grouped by each device. So instead of building a rule by only specifying the count, the rule is built by first specifying the device, then the count. The device could be thought of as an additional, dynamic user field that is nested under the map user field.
Selecting a Key

Building the Condition
Examples
Some user fields are mapped by default and populated through the use of the Lytics Javascript tag and Experiences. These out of the box fields can be incredibly useful when building audiences using Custom Rules.
Assuming that you have not made changes to the 'default' webLQLfile that is automatically created when theLytics Javascript Tagis installed, the following custom rules are available to you for use when building audiences.

There are a variety of use cases that involve targeting users who have engaged with previous marketing campaigns. For example, if a user converted on anIterable Experienceemail, and you want to follow up with an SMS message. The steps below will walk you through how to create an audience to target users who were reached by or clicked on anExperience.
All audience definitions are comprised of rules based onexisting audiences,content affinity,campaigns, andcustom rules. You may have noticed that after you add your first rule in the audience builder you have the option toAdd New RuleorAdd New Rule Set. Adding new rules and rulesets, and setting the conditions for their interaction, gives you the ability to refine which users your audiences target.

This audience has a single rule: included all users with the characteristicBehavior: Perusers. This will select all users with anintensity scoreof 20 or less but with afrequency scoreof 20 or greater. These are users who interact often but not on a deep level. You can refine this rule further by clickingAdd New Rule.



This audience now also includes a rule for users who have a low content affinity forTechnologycontent. Now that it has been added, there are three numbers of interest. The first number, 87,650, is the number of users with the characteristicBehavior: Perusers. The second number, 466,730, is the number of users who have low affinity forTechnologycontent. The third number, 11,514, are the users who meetbothof these conditions.


Clicking theAnd/Ortoggle, will switch the way the two rules intereact. The audience now includes all 542,921 users whoeitherhave the characteristicBehavior: Perusersor have low afffinity forTechnologycontent.
In addition to theAnd/Ortoggle, there is theIncluded/Excludedtoggle. This toggleinvertsa condition.
This audience contains a rule that targets the 159,084 users with the characteristicBrowser / OS: Mobileor users who have used a mobile devices.

Clicking theInclude/Excludetoggle the audience will now target the 705,166 users whodo nothave the characteristicBrowser / OS: Mobile.

The sum of the two numbers will be the total audience size that meets those rule(s).


This is especially apparent when using a rule such asCreated Timestamp Exists. Every user in Lytics will have a timestamp of when they were created. Therefore, the number of users whodo notmeet the condition of having a created timestamp will always be 0.


When building elaborate audiences, having a single set of rules that are evaluated using either anANDor anORis not enough. A ruleset is a set of rules that itself can be used as a rule for an even larger set of rules that is again evaluated using anANDor anOR.

This audience has two rulesets. The first ruleset has one rule: all users who have the characteristicEmail Capture Status: Known Email. The second ruleset has two rules: all users have some affinity forMarketingORAdvertisingcontent. Combining these two rulesets with theANDoperator produces an audience that targets users with an email address that have some interest in either marketing or advertising. This audience could be used to email a special newsletter or promotion about a product or trending topic that is related to marketing or advertising.

Rulesets, just like rules, can be excluded. Clicking theInclude/Excludetoogle on the second ruleset will result in the audience targeting all users with an email address who do not have some interest in either marketing or advertising. It could be used to send a different email to the remainder of your users with email addresses.
Configure your Lytics audiences with the following options to execute your use cases.

By default, newly created Lytics audiences are not enabled for API access and thus will not be available to public APIs. Enabling API access is necessary when integrating with other client-side tags/ pixels,Pathfora, or the Lyticspersonalization APIendpoints.
Select theAPI Accessiblecheckbox to enable access.
Lytics Insightsprovide visibility into the performance of your audiences and campaigns as users interact with your brand. Insights are generated out-of-the-box for Lytics Behavioral and Engagement audiences. You can also request up to10 custom audiencesto be prioritized as candidates for generating Insights.
When creating a new audience or editing an existing one, select theGenerate Insightscheckbox to make that audience a candidate for Insights (shown in the screenshot above).
Lytics prioritizes Insights based on the statistical significance of the data and the most frequently used audiences for your account. Therefore, even if you select the "Generate Insights" option for a particular audience, it is not guaranteed to show up in your Insights drawer.
Managing audiences becomes important as an account develops and your user base grows. Audiences are critical to both targeted campaigns as well as discovering insights about your users.
TheAudiencessection of Lytics houses all of your account’s audiences. You can view, create, and manage audiences from this section.

Audiences are listed alphabetically by default. Click any column header to change the sort property. Common sort options areLast ModifiedandSize(the number of users in the audience).
For better targeting, Lytics encourages the creation of many audiences. They’re easy and free to make. When working with a large library of audiences, naming conventions become important.
Name your audiences by purpose and include any categorization in the name. Giving them a common prefix (e.g., Holiday Promo: Tech lovers, Holiday Promo: Loyal Shoppers) will help you to keep everything related next to each other in the user interface.

Audiences appear throughout the Lytics platform. Make sure your naming convention works in any context to avoid confusion.
The easiest way to find an audience is to use theSearchbox. As you enter your search term the audience list will display any matching audiences.
Fuzzy matching is used to search for audiences so the results will not be an exact match to the search term.
Occasionally you will want to return to previously created audiences and update the logic used to create the segment.
When editing audiences that are in an active triggered workflow, it is recommended that you reconfigure the job after the audience changes have been made.
Audiences created by duplication will retain the name and slug of the duplicated audience, but with have "duplicate" appended at the end. It is recommended that you update both the name and manually input a unique slug name for clarity sake.
Deleting audiences is an integral part to keeping a tidy workspace in Lytics. Audiences can be deleted in one of two ways: individually or in batch.
Note: Deleting an audience does not delete the users associated with that audience.
From theAudiencespage, click any audience in the list to view all of its details.
An audience's landing page contains a lot of valuable information about your users and the audience itself. At the top of the audience page, you will find the following information...
Below this information you will find multiple tabs where you can access additional information about the audience.
The audience summary page is designed to provide insights into the current state of an audience as well as how the audience has changed over time. When first navigating to an audience landing page, this tab will be selected by default.
The Summary tab includes the following sections:
After creating a new audience, the audience size graph will begin to populate within a day. Depending on the date range you specify, the activity graph can be viewed using following intervals:
Audience Size Trends
The statistics for audience size start from the creation date of the audience.
Keep in mind that audiences are real-time. This makes them quite different from the user lists in other marketing tools which are frozen in time and only change when you update the list. Audiences are filters applied to the total audience and will change whenever a user's behavior changes in a way that will add or remove them from the audience definition. In this way, tracking audience size over time is a powerful reporting tool.
For example, you create an audience that contains users who have visited the international news section of your website. Upon creation the audience contains 120,000 users. You then run a marketing campaign promoting your international news section. After one week, the audience has grown from 120,000 to 400,000 users with most of the growth occurring in the 24 hours after the campaign was launched. This is clear evidence that the campaign was effective, and most effective in the first 24 hours, at driving users to your international news section.s
Select theDetailstab to view the following sections:
Select theCharacteristicstab to view the characteristics of users in this audience. Characteristics include:
Select theLogstab to view recent events relating to this audience. Activity such as creation, updating and syncing can all be found here.
Creating a Lytics Experience is one of the easiest and most common ways to activate Lytics Audiences. Learn more aboutLytics Experiencesto find out how you can engage your audiences on site.
The Lytics Experience Editor is a great way to get started with website personalization, but through the use of the Lytics API, there is much more that can be done.
The Lytics Experience editor is powered by the Pathfora SDK which is in turn powered by the Lytics Entity API. The Lytics Entity API is how to find out what audiences the current user belongs to as well as what traits the user has. Using the Lytics Entity API it's possible to create completely custom personalized experiences on your site.
Personalizing a site using the Public Entity API requires making code changes to the host website.
To read more about the Entity API,check out the API documentation.
A core benefit of Lytics is exporting your smart audiences to the other tools in your marketing tech stack. That way, the campaigns run on your channels are enriched with thebehavioral dataandcontent affinitiespowered by data science on Lytics.
From the audience overview page, click theExportbutton to create a new export job . TheExportmenu lists built in exports such asEmail CSVand any out of the box Integrations. Specific instructions for exporting can be found in the Integrations section (under the desired tool) of our documentation.

Learn how Audiences Groups can help you organize your Audiences
Welcome to the documentation for Audience Groups, a powerful new feature that allows you to organize and manage your audiences effectively. With Audience Groups, you can group related audiences together, making it easier to navigate and work with your audience segments within the Lytics platform. This document will guide you through the setup and management of Audience Groups, empowering you to leverage this feature to its fullest potential.
Audience Groupscan improve how your Audiences are organized within Lytics. Think of anAudience Groupas a folder ofAudiences, where anAudiencecan belong to multipleAudience Groups. This comes in handy when grouping audiences based on a campaign, based on an author, or for setting up an A/B test.
Creating GroupsThe Audience Group Management feature offers a user-friendly interface for creating new groups. Users can easily access the group creation functionality from within the audience management experience. The following steps outline the process for creating a new group:
Editing GroupsThe Audience Group Management feature allows users to modify and update the definition of their audience groups. This ensures that groups accurately reflect the desired characteristics and targeting criteria. Here's how to manage an existing group:
Deleting GroupsThe Audience Group Management feature provides users with the ability to delete individual or multiple audience groups as needed. The following steps outline the process for deleting groups:
The Bulk Actions feature allows users to perform actions on multiple audiences simultaneously, enhancing the audience management experience. While the functionality initially supported only bulk deletion of audiences, it has been reworked to also include bulk-adding audiences to a group. This documentation provides a comprehensive guide on utilizing the Bulk Actions feature.
Out of the box, Lytics provides a set ofPrebuilt Audience Groups, a set of predefined groups that offer convenient categorization and management of audiences within the Lytics platform. These prebuilt Audience Groups are designed to save you time and provide quick access to commonly used audience segments.
When creating new Audiences, Audience Groups can be accessible in the Audience Builder. Under theExisting Audiencestab, theFilter by Groupoption allows you to display only the audiences that exist in a specific group. This can streamline your Audience building process. The image below shows how one can access theAudiences Groupsvia theAudience Builder.

Reports can consist of one or manyComponents. Think of aComponentas a method of visualizing data. EachComponentprovides different ways of displaying and drilling into your data.
Supported Components:
You can select from a list of Component types by clicking the+ Add New Componentbutton on the Report Page. Click on the desired component to add it to your Report.
Lytics provides a handful of methods of managing your Report Components.
Size Comparisoncomponents allow you to display multiple Audience Sizes on one chart. This component can help compare multiple audiences simultaneously, commonly used for variation testing.
To create aSizecomponent, select one or many Audiences in theEdit Componentmenu. In the configuration menu, you can set the Component'sname,description, andAudiencesbased on the selectedtable. After selecting and saving the Audience(s), the Component will display a time-series chart of the Audience size(s).

Once aSizecomponent is created, thetime-rangeand thestackedoptions can be selected.
By default, theSizecomponent will chart the last seven days of data. To customize the start and end dates, click on the dates in the upper-right section of the component.

To display the Audience sizes on separate charts, toggle theStackedoption in the lower left section of the component.

Sizecomponents can also be visualized as a single number by selecting theNumberchart type.

Audience Overlapcomponents allow you to understand the intersection or lack thereof between two or more Lytics audiences.
To create anOverlapcomponent, select one or many Audiences in theEdit Componentmenu. In the configuration menu, you can set the Component'sname,description, andAudiences. After selecting and saving the Audience(s), the Component will display a Venn diagram representing each audience and their collective overlap.

These insights can be quickly activated by clicking directly on any intersections. This will take you to a pre-populated audience definition with rules defined representing the portion of the diagram you clicked on. For instance, in the above example, clicking on.Multi Session Visitorswithin theHas Visited Webaudience will produce the following audience definition.

Data Flowcomponents allow you to see how data flows through your connected Providers, Data Streams, Audiences, and Destinations.
To create aData Flowcomponent, select up to 5 Audiences in theEdit Componentmenu. In the configuration menu, you can set the Component'sname,description, andAudiences. After selecting and saving the Audience(s), the Component will display a Bipartite diagram containing each of the selected Audiences and the connected Providers, Streams, and Destinations.
TheEdit Componentmenu also provides options to hide (or display) the Providers, Streams, or Destination columns. This allows the user to "zoom in" on different aspects of the Data Flow diagram.

Insights for this Component can be accessed by hovering over or clicking directly on any line in the diagram. Hovering over a line will prompt the Dataflow Tooltip, which contains information about the Job - such as when it was created and the number of users exported.
Clicking directly on the line will take you to the Job's page for the corresponding job. For instance, clicking on the yellow line between "All" and "Google Cloud" will redirect you to this page.

Compositioncomponents allow you to visualize a field in theuserorcontentschema across one or many Audiences. This can be useful to compare a field across Audiences or to analyze the data distribution for a group of users.
To create aCompositioncomponent, click on theEdit Componentbutton. In the configuration menu, thename,description(optional),Audiences,FieldandSubFieldcan be selected. Depending on the field type, Lytics provides a variety of ways to visualize the data. The data can be viewed as a Bar Chart, Line Chart, Pie Chart, Table, or Stats view for numeric fields. The following table shows all of the chart types for each field type.





Once you've created aCompositioncomponent, the bottom navigation bar allows you to customize your component. Here, you can select your desired chart type, toggle between stacked and unstacked charts, download data, and customize your component.



As a first example, we'll walk you through creating your firstCompositioncomponent usingdevicedata.

As a more complex example, we'll chart the distribution of users' affinity for a Content Topic across two different Audiences.

Paragraphs:
Topicsare the building blocks of theAffinity Engine. Simply put, aTopicis an attribute tied to the documents your users interact with. By default, these documents are the URLs on your site, but they can also be customized to include items from a product catalog. Each document is associated with a set of Topics that reflect the content it contains.
Every user profile automatically includes the URLs they’ve visited. Thanks to the connection between URLs and their associated Topics, Lytics can algorithmically determine which Topics a user is interested in based on their behavior.
This process forms the foundation of Lytics’ content recommendations and helps you build audiences around content affinity.
Since topic affinities are a product of user behavior, conclusions can only be drawn about topic affinities relative to other topics and other users. For these reasons, attempting to calculate topicaversionwould be an unsafe extrapolation.
To view your Topics, navigate to theInterest Enginepage, click on theStandardtile, and select theTopicstab.
AnAffinitycombines one or moreTopicsinto a targetable group. WhileTopicsprovide detailed insights, they can often be too specific for broader marketing strategies. That’s where Affinities come in—they allow you to group relatedTopicsinto a more actionable unit.
For example, imagine you’re a car dealership looking to target customers interested in luxury cars. You could create a Luxury Car Affinity that includes brands like BMW, Audi, and Mercedes. This Affinity lets you build an audience of users with an interest in any luxury car brand, which you can then export to ad networks or other marketing platforms for targeted campaigns.

For theStandardInterest Engine, Topics are generated using Lytics' Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools, as well as meta-tags from webpages. To learn more about how Topics are enriched, visit ourEnrichmentdocumentation.
In some cases, Lytics' NLP tools may identify irrelevant Topics. To address this, you can block unwanted Topics by selecting the checkbox next to each one. Once blocked, the Topic will appear in the Blocked Topics table and will no longer show up on user profiles or in documents.
When you click on aTopicin the Topics table, you’ll be taken to the Topic Summary page, which provides detailed insights about the selected Topic.
The Topic Summary page also displaysRelated Topics, which are identified based on their frequent co-occurrence with the selected Topic. These related Topics appear in the bottom-right corner of the page and are also visible in the Content Map view.
TheTopic Taxonomy(or Content Map) is built by analyzing documents and the Topics they contain, revealing patterns of co-occurrence and Topic prevalence. You can use the slider at the bottom of the Content Map to highlight strong connections—Topics that frequently appear together. In the example below, we can see that theFurnituretopic is highlighted, as well as each of its related Topics (such asHouse, andFaux Fur Bean Bag).

As you select Topics, they will be added to the Assigned Topics list on the right. In this example, we created an Affinity named "Concert Affinity" that included Topics such as "Concerts", "Live Music" and "Performances".
There are two ways you can remove selected Topics from your Affinity.
Once an Affinity has been created, you can add or remove Topics at a later time, and edit the name or description.
EachAffinityhas a summary page that provides an overview of how many users are interested in this group of Topics and how much of your brand's content or product inventory is represented. After creating an Affinity, or when clicking any row in the Affinity list, you'll be directed to this summary page.
At the top of the Affinity Summary page, you’ll find the following details:
After creating an Affinity, it may take a few days for the chart to fully populate as Lytics evaluates users' interest in the selected Topics. To the left of the chart, you’ll find key metrics::
On the chart, the X axis shows affinity scores on a scale from 0-100, where 0 represents "no interest" and 100 represents the "highest interest." The Y axis displays the number of users. You can click on individual bars to see how many users fall within specific affinity ranges.
This data helps your marketing team identify which users to target based on their interest levels. For example, you can focus on users with medium-to-high affinity for certain Topics in an ad campaign, increasing the likelihood of relevance and conversions.
This section outlines how your Affinity is configured.

Paragraphs:
The Affinity Engine enriches user profiles based on behavior, but its true value lies in how you act on that data. In Lytics, Affinity Engine insights can be applied in three key ways: segmentation, recommendation, and Lookalike Models.
Lytics integrates Affinity Engine scores directly into user profiles, allowing you to use these scores in the audience builder to segment users based on their Affinities. This unlocks a variety of strategic use cases. For example, if you're a shoe retailer launching a new line of boots, you can create an audience of users with an interest in boots, ensuring that your ad spend targets the right users instead of those with little to no interest.
Beyond targeting, Affinities can help you track trends over time. You may notice that interest in boots spikes during the winter—or perhaps it begins to rise in the fall, as customers start exploring options before the colder months. Affinities provide valuable insights as user interests shift over time, making them a powerful tool for trend analysis.
Lytics' Recommendation system blends AI with marketing strategy to help you easily suggest relevant content and products to your users. By setting up personalized Recommendations, you can deliver more engaging user experiences, which in turn boosts time on-site and overall engagement.
Lytics makes it easy to get up and running with Content Recommendations. Upon configuration, our Recommendation system:
Leverages over 500 behavioral signals to deliver highly relevant recommendations.
Operates autonomously, with models that retrain and optimize on a weekly basis to keep recommendations fresh.
Works effectively right out-of-the-box for new users, requiring little to no prior data to provide valuable content suggestions.
Scales rapidly to meet the demands of large volumes and high user traffic.
To get started, navigate to thePersonalizepage underUsing Profiles, or consult theContent Recommendation API documentation
Affinity Engine scores are also highly valuable when building Lookalike Models. These scores offer a standardized way to compare users, creating data consistency across profiles, which is crucial for machine learning models. This consistency allows affinity scores to often emerge as key factors in Lookalike Models. If your team is working on predictive audiences, leveraging Affinities can significantly enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of your models.

Paragraphs:
TheClassificationpage offers insight into how your content is being scraped, indexed, and categorized by the Lytics Content Affinity Engine. You can access this page under the Content menu, and it includes two main sections: theClassification DashboardandContent Classification.
The Classification Dashboard displays theClassification Activity,Content Flow, and theContent Dashboardcomponents. Learn more about each component below.
TheClassification Activitysection shows how many documents the Lytics Content Engine is classifying. By default, Lytics will classify up to 20,000 documents per month, which includes new documents as well as periodic reclassification of existing ones. This section helps you track whether you’ve reached your monthly quota and ensure the Content Engine is functioning as expected.
The Lytics Content Engine runs multiple workflows in the background, including the content classification workflow, which updates hourly. As long as you haven’t exceeded your monthly quota, you can expect hourly updates to the classification activity.
If your account has hit the content classification quota in previous weeks, you may notice a lack of data in the chart for the current week. Adjust the date range to see when content was last classified.
(The Content Flow chart visualizes how your documents are ingested, processed, and enriched with Topics by the Lytics Content Engine. It also highlights any errors or problematic URLs such as URLs that are blocked byrobots.txtdirectives,Account Settings, or URLs that encounter non-200 status codes.
Each state in the Flow diagram is described in detail below:
TheContent Dashboarddisplays various attributes of your Content, including site name, author, URL path, and Topic information. TheClassification Dashboardis intended to provide a high-level understanding of your Content and can be used as a starting point for your Content-oriented use cases.
TheManual Content Classificationmodule allows you to manually add a URL to Lytics or preview how a specific document will be classified. This feature is useful for troubleshooting any setup issues on your page before it’s added to the Lytics content corpus.
To use it, simply enter the URL of the document you want to preview and clickClassify. You’ll be able to see the extracted Topics as well as any metadata that Lytics scrapes from the document.
Adding and Removing Topics
When previewing a document, you can manually Add or Remove topics from the Classification. To add a Topic,  click theAdd Topicbutton, select the desiredRelevancescore (between 0 and 1) and then clickAdd topic to Document.
To remove a Topic, simply click theXnext to the Topic tile.
Once you're satisfied with the results of the classification, clickComplete Classificationto add the Documentto the content corpus. The document and its associated Topics will then be available for use in personalization efforts, such as recommendations or content affinity.
As Lytics ingests web-based content, it attempts to resolve duplicate URLs and create links between documents, much like a search engine would.  As such, Lytics does things like respectrobots.txtdirectives, resolve canonical URLs when present, etc.
Lytics attempts to sanitize URLs as much as possible before ingesting them into the Content Affinity Engine.  Sanitization includes removing all URL parameters and cleaning URL syntax.  This happens via an LQL function calledurlmain.

Paragraphs:
To better understand how users are engaging with content, Lytics first needs to understand that content itself. One way Lytics does this is by analyzing the URLs that are passed to Lytics to determine the topics that best describe the URL.
When Lytics receives data about actions taken by a customer, it is called an event. Each event has fields that store pieces of information describing the event, including the URL. By associating topics with URLs, Lytics is also able to understand which topics a user has engaged with. In doing so, the Lytics Content Affinity Engine can find relevant content for users, as well as find relevant users for content.
When Lytics receives an event with a URL in it - specifically when an event with a field namedurlcomes in on any data stream - Lytics determines whether the URL is new or not. A new URL is one that Lytics has not previously handled.
Lytics then creates a new event and writes that event to the data streamlytics_content_enrich, called thecontent enrichment stream. An LQL query namedlytics_contenthandles events written to the content enrichment stream. This results in a new entity being created in thecontenttable.
Lytics listens for events with new URLs on the content enrichment stream. When a new event is available, Lytics runs the URL enrichment process.
Data enrichment is a common practice in Lytics. It refers to the ability to add data onto inbound data to improve its quality. This process is also used in user profile enrichment.
Enrichment is handled by components calledenrichers. Each enricher performs a specific task. A common task for an enricher is to associate topics with a URL, but there are other tasks that enrichers can perform.
Whatever its specific purpose, the result of an enricher running is that additional data may be added to the inbound data (event). After the enrichers run, another new event is written to the content enrichment process.
This time, the new event is not enriched because the URL is not new. But the event includes all of the data that was previously added during the enrichment process, so when the querylytics_contentruns, it is able to map that new data to the corresponding entity in the content table.
The specific enrichers that Lytics uses depends on how your account is configured. The account settingenrich_content_sourcescontrols which enrichers are used. Your Lytics representative can help you change the enrichers that are enabled on your account.
The meta enricher is always used by Lytics for content enrichment.
The meta-enrichment process begins with Lytics sending a request for the URL. The response allows Lytics to collect some information to improve the efficiency of the overall enrichment process.
Examples of information collected are:
The following Natural Language Processing (NLP) services are available in Lytics for content enrichment. Each link takes you to the Language support page for that service, if applicable.
The Setting column denotes the account setting change needed to enable the service, which must be enabled byLytics Support.
Since Lytics collects and stores every event without any aggregation, automatic topic extraction becomes a possibility. For every URL seen, Lytics uses a bot (calledlyticsbot) to fetch the web page at that URL. The content, metadata and images of the URL is analyzed and boiled down to a set of Topics.
If some of your content is premium and requires a login to access, then you'll need to create a new authorization so Lytics can access this content. To do this:
Whenlyticsbotscrapes your content, you can identify it with some HTTP headers that will be present on every request, namely:
This will allow you to identify requests from Lytics to scrape that content to enhance your topic graph.
For some websites it is desirable to allowlyticsbotto crawl everything as fast as possible. However, some web administrators would like more flexibility and control over how fast and where the bot attempts to pull content from. The bot will follow a set of directives that would be located at the root of the website, for instancehttps://www.lytics.com/robots.txt.
Below you can see three commonrobots.txtconfigurations.
You must specify thelyticsbotuser agent. A wild card will not work in this case.
Lytics will automatically extract topics from the main content at a URL, but sometimes domain specific topics are also desired to track. In this case, Lytics supports a special meta tag for annotating custom topics.
Provide a comma-separated list of topics in alytics:topicsmeta element in your HTML source.
Here is an example from a Lytics blog post:
Additionally, your Lytics account can be configured to also scrape other meta tags to feed into your topic graph by setting the account'scontent_custompropssetting to the names of the meta tags you'd also like to include.
For example, if you wanted your Lytics topic graph to include topics from yourarticle:tagmeta tags, you could update your account settings with the following API request.
Now, after adding thearticle:tagtopic, any values fromarticle:tagmeta tags will also appear in the topic graph — which means they'll be eligible for content affinities, targeting and personalization, and inform content recommendations.
Lytics will track these custom topicsin addition tothe automatically extracted topics. Do not specify generic topics, there is no need.
Each document is assigned a URL as a unique identifier. You can use the Lytics Content API to retrieve a document and view the topics assigned to it.
This will return a JSON object of the requested document:
You can see the topics assigned to the requested content and the relevancy range of those topics from 0 to 1.
In most cases topic extraction automatically assigns the expected topic to your content. If, however, you find that to not be the case or you would like to expand the topics assigned to content, Lytics allows you to manually assign topics to your content.
Content is stored in an entity called a document. Each document is a collection of fields each storing a specific piece of information about that content. Each document may have multiple fields that are used to store the topics for that particular entity. The process of manually assigning topics involves updating one of those fields.
Manually assigning topics can be done in several ways:
The data (in either CSV or JSON format) can be sent to Lytics using any of the methods available for importing data, including CSV file or JSON file integrations and the Lytics Bulk Upload API. Just be sure that you send the data to the correct data stream:lytics_content_enrich.
The uploaded data must be formatted in the following ways:
When data is sent to the data streamlytics_content_enrich, the LQL functionurlmainis applied to the value. You can see this in the querylytics_content. The result is that://and everythingbeforeit is removed. This is important to understand because if you ever need to find a URL, you should exclude://and the protocol before it:
The content corpus endpoint can be used to associate topics with a URL. The corpus API does not allow you to specify the relevance. Topics will be assigned a relevance 1.
The following command demonstrates how to use this API to set topics on content:
The topic curation endpoint can be used to add topics to content. However, this approach is a bit more complicated because you must know an identifier for the content you want to add new topics to.
By default, the following fields are identifiers oncontenttable:
How to Generate a Hash for a URL
There are many hash functions available, but Lytics uses a specific one when it hashes URLs: sip hash.
The following command demonstrates how to use the Lytics query test evaluation endpoint to generate a sip hash for a URL. In this example, the value that is used ishttps://www.lytics.com
The result of this command will be something like the following. The value of the fieldhashedis the hashed value
If you are using the Visual Studio Code Extension for Lytics, there is a command that you can use to generate a sip hash without having to write any API calls.
Above you determined the sip hash forhttps://www.lytics.comis7394646926640356587. The following command will associate the topicCDPwith a relevance of1.0with this hashed URL:
When a topic is associated with a document, a new field is created on the entity. The field stores a value from zero (no relevance) to one (highest relevance).
In Lytics, you cannot delete fields from documents. So, technically, there is no way to remove a topic from being associated with a content entity. Instead, what you do is set the relevance to zero. Since zero indicates no relevance, it effectively removes the topic from the document.
Removing a topic is not the same as blocking a topic. Blocking a topic acknowledges that a topic may be relevant but is too generic to be useful. For example, at Lytics we block the topic "data" because that topic is relevant on almost all of our content, and for that reason it is not useful at all.
Topics can be removed from content using one of the following approaches.
As described above, CSV or JSON data can be sent to Lytics. The following examples demonstrate how to remove a topic from content by setting the relevance for the topic to zero:
The topic remove endpoint allows you to remove a topic associated with content.
This API sets the relevance for the topics to zero. It does not actually delete any the topic from the content.
Above you determined the sip hash forhttps://www.lytics.comis7394646926640356587. The following command will remove the topicCDPfrom this hashed URL:

Paragraphs:
Content Recommendations are a powerful tool that can be used to increase user engagement by presenting users with relevant content that resonates with them. By utilizing the Lytics topic taxonomy and powerful Machine-Learning algorithms, Lytics can make data-driven Content Recommendations within milliseconds. Powered by over 500 features, and the flexibility to customize your recommendations, Lytics' Content Recommendation API removes the heavy lifting when it comes to content personalization via web, email, etc.
Out of the box, Lytics' Content Recommendations can be leveraged in 3 ways:
The Lytics UI offers multiple ways to test, validate, and get started with Content Recommendations. Both theInterest Enginepage and theContent Collectionpage provide options for fetching recommendations for individual users.
To access Recommendations from the Interest Engine page, navigate to theInterest Enginepage under theContentnavigation menu, select an Interest Engine, and click on theRecommendtab.  After entering a user ID and clicking Recommend, Lytics will generate recommendations tailored to that specific user.
To access Collection-specific recommendations, navigate to a Collection under the Collections page in the Content menu and select the Recommendations tab. This page provides options for creating RecommendationsExperiences, links to theContent Recommendation API, code snippets, and a search bar to fetch Collection-specific Recommendations for a user.
You can create personalized, customizable recommendation experiences on any site where the Lytics JavaScript tag is installed.
Pathfora JS is capable of taking a content collection and fetching and displaying the recommended content for the current user. Read more about it in thePathfora JS Docs.
The Lytics content recommendation API takes a handful of parameters, including the user the recommendation is for and an optional content collection to recommend from.
Content collections are commonly used in content recommendations. By selecting a content collection as the source of your content recommendation, you're limiting which content the recommendation engine can select from. This is desirable for most use cases, because by default Lytics will scrape any and all pages of your website that users are visiting. Without a content collection defined, the recommendation engine will return what is most relevant to the user regardless of the context. For example, in a marketing context you wouldn't want to promote your careers page, even if it is the most relevant piece of content to the user in question.
Size of the collection is also an important factor when using a collection for recommendation. The more content the recommendations engine has access to, the better, more personalized recommendations it can serve. If you can, try to make sure your content collection is of a decent size, and at the minimum fits the following requirements:
If none of the documents in your collection fit these conditions, the recommendation engine may have issues returning recommendations as it doesn't have enough information to make a recommendation. If you would like assistance setting up these filters in your collection or to set up a collection with content published less than 1 week in the past, contactLytics Support.
When setting up a recommended content Experience through the Lytics UI, you will be asked to select an existing content collection or build a new collection to use in the experience.
If you're using the Lytics API to recommend content, you can use thecontentsegmentquery parameter to define the content collection you want to use. The value of this parameter should be the ID of the content collection.
You can locate the ID of the collection from the URL on the summary page. The ID will come after/collections/in the URL, and will end before the beginning of the query parameters.
When building a recommendation-based Experience, you have access to theaffinity alignment scoreautomatically calculated by Lytics.

The “alignment” score measures the similarity between the selected Content Collection and the Audience. This similarity is based upon the “vector similarity” of the most prevalent topics in the Collection, and the most prevalent topics in the Audience. If the Collection and the Audience share many of the same topics, the “alignment” score will be high. Conversely, if the Collection and the Audience share few or no topics, then the “alignment” score will be low.
For successful Content Recommendations, we recommend pairing Collections and Audiences with moderate to high alignment. If there is low alignment, Content Recommendations may have low conversion rates and may be irrelevant to users in the selected Audience.

Paragraphs:
Lytics considers every piece of content as a "document", and calls the collection of every document a "corpus". Lytics automatically processes every web page for an account's site, where each web page is a "document". In the Lytics app, documents are surfaced in association with topics and in content recommendations.
Keep in mind that the Lytics Content Affinity Engine isn't limited to your website content. All sorts of content can be sent to Lytics, including product catalogs to power Product Recommendations.
To search for a document in Lytics, go to theSearchpage under theContentmenu. Enter a URL or search term, then clickSearchto find the relevant documents.
Clicking on a row will lead you to theDocument Summarypage, which contains more details about the Document.
On an individual document page you are able to see all the fields associated to that particular document within the Details tab.
To see if this document is used in any Content Collections, you can view theCollectionstab.
If you make adjustments to any of your documents, such as updating a blog post or refreshing a product landing page, you can request Lytics to manually re-classify the document. This will ensure the Lytics content corpus has the most up-to-date information to serve in any of your content or product recommendations.
By default, Lytics observes new URLs in all data streams to identify content with which the user is registering activity.  New URLs are enriched as they're observed in incoming data — that is, Lytics can crawl a domain, but proactively indexing a domain and looking for new content is not part of the Content Affinity Engine's workflow.
To add new documents to your corpus:
You can send new documents directly to our Content Corpus API.  The Corpus API respects three parameters:
You can also use the manual classification module to preview the enrichment of a URL and then add it to the content corpus.
Adding custom properties to a document allows you to create advanced content collections based on those custom properties. Imagine creating recommendations from a pool of custom categories, promoting pages with custom seasonality components for particular holidays, adding a custom SKU hierarchy to better reflect your product catalog within Lytics, etc.
The Lytics crawler can detect custom document properties from custom meta tags — any meta tag with a name property prefixed withlytics:will be ingested and appended onto a document.  For example, a meta tag with the namelytics:skuwill update theskufield on that document.
When Lytics scrapes new documents, it will append those properties on the newly generated content entity within Lytics.  When adding a field that isn't currently represented within the content schema, the content query will need to be updated with the new property.

Paragraphs:
Content Collections in Lytics allow you to programmatically organize, filter, and segment the documents that have been scraped, enriched, and analyzed by the Lytics Content Affinity Engine. While Audiences focus on segmenting users based on their behaviors, interests, and affinities, Collections are designed to segment and curate content based on its attributes, topics, and metadata.
By creating content collections, you can gain a macro-level view of your content, allowing for easier management and curation. Collections serve as powerful tools to not only monitor the types of content being gathered, but also to define which content should be used in various applications like personalized recommendations, campaigns, and targeted experiences.
Building a content collection is a crucial step in setting up content recommendation workflows. It enables you to fine-tune which pieces of content will be recommended to users based on their interests and behaviors, ensuring that your personalization strategies align with the most relevant and enriched documents in your content library.

Content Collections
Introduction
Resources
Crawling: https://docs.lytics.com/docs/creating-content-collections
Paragraphs:
You can build a content collection in Lytics by navigating toContent > Collectionsfrom the dashboard. Then click theNew Collectionbutton above the list of current collections in your account.
Collections can either be dynamic or locked. In the collection builder you can toggle this between these two options.
Dynamic collections are rule-based, so individual pieces of content may enter or exit the collection over time. Dynamic collections are built by selecting and setting content filters which determine what content is present in the collection at any given time. Preview content currently in the collection by hovering over a content card and clickingPreview this content.
For example, you can create a collection that includes all articles published in the last 7 days. This setting is ideal for making sure your content collection remains fresh.
A locked content collection is a static collection of documents that you hand-select using the collection builder. Content filters can be used as a searching mechanism to help find the specific documents you would like to add to your custom collection. You can add content items to the collection by hovering over a content card and clickingSelect this content.
Selected content items are indicted by cards with a blue border. Once you save the collection, documents are not added or removed until you edit and save the collection again.
There are a number of filters available when navigating the content collection builder. These filters can be combined in such a way that narrow down the documents in the collection using "AND" logic.
This filter acts as a catch-all text search for the title, description, and URL of the document. It can be a full or partial match to any of these fields, and the input is case sensitive. You can enter multiple values for this filter type, and the results are not mutually exclusive. That is, if you have entered the search terms "Dog" and "Cat", each of the documents returned should contain "Dog" or "Cat", but not necessarily both ("OR" logic).
Perhaps the most common use of this field is to filter by a URL path. For example, say you're looking to build a dynamic collection of all blog posts from your website, and the URL of your blog posts match the following pattern:http://yourdomain.com/blog/name-of-your-post. To build this collection you can enter/blog/into this filter.
The type of a document is derived by the Lytics Content Affinity Engine while analyzing and indexing the document. A document maybe be classified as any of the following:
These checkbox filters allow you to view content of only the selected type(s). For example, if you want to build a dynamic collection of videos to recommend to users, you might select theVideocontent type.
This filter allows you to limit documents based on their date of publication. You may filter documents published after a date relative to the current time or after a static date in time. Relative dates may be set by increments of days, weeks, months, or years.
Using a relative date filter allows you ensure that the content in your collection is evergreen. For example you may want to only recommend content that was published in the last week:
If you launched a new product recently, you may want to build a collection of content relevant to that launch. Using the static date filter set to the day before the launch, combined with other filters could help achieve this.
The features filter allows you to select whether or not the content should have a description and/or a thumbnail image. Both the image and description fields are extracted from HTML meta tags during the scraping process of the content affinity engine. Enabling these settings may be especially useful if you are looking to implement content recommendations into a space on your website and you wish to include more than just a title and link to the content.
The author filter allows you to include only articles written by the author(s) selected. If you have a long list of authors, you can use the search bar to find the author(s) you are looking for.
The Affinities filter lists all the curated Affinities in your account. Since Affinities are a group of related topics, this option can save you time when building collections for a campaign targeting users interested in several related subjects or products.
The Topics filter lists all the topics present in your account. You can select one or multiple to filter the content by, and use the search bar to find specific topics. Building a collection filtered by topic can be especially helpful when running a topic specific campaign.
The filters above cover many common use cases. However, in some cases a more advanced set of filtering criteria is required. This is achievable via theAdvanced Editorwhich is accessible from the triple dot menu on a collection summary or from the collection editor view.
From theAdvanced Editoryou can leverage the inclusion of other content collections or a custom rule just as you would with custom rules in the core Audience Builder. These custom rules surface the full set of fields associated with your content during the classification process. Word count, language in addition to allfiltersreferenced above are accessible through this advanced editor.
Currently the Advanced Editor is only accessible for existing collections. If you are looking to create a net new collection, simply create a new collection with a basic filter and save. From there you can access the Advanced Editor.

Learn more about Lytics' Interest Engines
Lytics' Interest Engines allow you to analyze, interpret, and incorporate user interests into your marketing activities. While Lytics Interest Engine is primarily used with webpages, Lytics provides 3 kinds of Interest Engines for various use cases and tactics.
Interest Engines are a rather foreign concept and you may be confused about how this can help improve your marketing initiatives. Keep in mind that the end goal is to gain abetter understanding of your users. With Lytics' Interest Engine, there are two commonly used techniques to best utilize this powerful data:
Topics & Affinities: With theDefaultengine andCustom Affinity Engines, you can use the Lytics UI to view theTopic Taxonomy. This visualization displays how your Topics co-occur and relate to each other. TheTopic Taxonomyview can be useful to visualize similar Topics, which can be useful in creatingAffinities.
User Segmentation: Lytics Interest Engines output a new field on the user profile that captures the interests that a user has exhibited. Using this data, you can create high-powered audiences to target users with specific interests using Lytics Audience Builder.
Recommendations: Using Lytics' Recommendation API, you can enable personalized recommendations for your users based on their activities. For instance, you can recommend URLs based on a user's browsing history, or recommend products based on a user's purchase history. To get started with Recommendations, check out the Recommendation documentation, or navigate to the Experiences tab.
To create a new Interest Engine, navigate to theEnginespage in theContentnavigation dropdown, and click on theNew Interest Enginebutton. When clicked, this displays a modal that allows you to select between:
Each option will present you with a wizard to configure the Engine. Please contact Lytics Support if you experience any issues creating your new Interest Engine.

Paragraphs:
The Default Interest Engine works by analyzing web-data collected via the Lytics Javascript Tag. Out-of-the box, Lytics ingests and keeps track of all new URLs that we receive. For each URL, we use a variety of NLP (Natural Language Processing) tools to extractTopics. For more information about the Topic Enrichment process, please refer to theEnrichmentdocumentation.
The Header displays information about how the Default Interest Engine is configured. Though these values are uneditable, additional customization can be achieved withCustom Interest Engines. For the Default Engine, web-pages are saved in thecontenttable with a unique identifier known as ahashedurl(simply a hash function applied to a parsed URL). For items in thecontenttable, Topics (or features) are saved in theglobalfield. On the user side, we keep track of the URLs a user has browsed in thehashedurlsfield, and we output Topics that a user has interacted with to thelytics_contentfield.
The UI for Default Interest Engine shows the Summary, Topics, and Affinities. In the Summary section, we display aTopic Taxonomy- a force-directed graph that maps how Topics interact with each other. The table next to the Taxonomy displays statistics about your Users, and Topics. Expanding the rows in the table will display sample items and users and the associated Topics.
Topics & Affinitiescan be viewed under their respective tabs. The Topics view shows all of the Topics associated with the Default Interest Engine. Clicking on a Topic will present more information a specific Topic. Similarly, the Affinities tab displays all the Affinities associated with the Default Interest Engine.
Since the Default Interest Engine is designed to work quickly out-of-the-box for new accounts, you can quickly take advantage of all of the offerings provided.

Paragraphs:
If you have your own set of attributes, features, orTopicsfor your inventory, then you may consider creating aCustom Interest Engine. These Engines allow you to configure any field on thecontenttable to be aTopicthat gets outputted ontouserprofiles. Consider the following examples ofCustom Interest Engines
To create a new Custom Interest Engine, click on theNew Interest Enginebutton on theInterest Enginespage. Once the modal opens up, clicking on theAffinity Customizationtile will open a wizard.
The first step requires selecting the unique identifier and features (or Topics) from your inventory (ie thecontenttable). In the screenshot below, we are using the Shopify example from earlier, and using theshopify_product_idandshopify_product_tagsfields.
Once the Inventory and Features have been identified, the next step requires mapping the data to your user profiles. The Inventory Field refers to the field on theusertable that contains a set ofshopify_product_ids(ie a set of unique identifiers from thecontenttable). In this case, theshopify_product_idsfield is an array of IDs that a user has purchased. Next, configure the name of the output field - this field will contain theshopify_product_tagsthat a user has expressed interest in based on theirshopify_product_ids.

Custom Interest Engines
Creating a New Custom Interest Engine
Crawling: https://docs.lytics.com/docs/collaborative-filters
Paragraphs:
To successfully utilize Lytics'DefaultandCustom AffinityEngines, it is necessary to have a robust set ofTopics(or features). However, in some cases, it becomes difficult to addTopicsto your items, which may prevent you from executing Interest-based use cases. To address some of the limitations of content-based filtering,Collaborative Filteringuses similarities between users and items simultaneously to provide recommendations. This allows for serendipitous recommendations; that is, collaborative filtering models can recommend an item to user A based on the interests of a similar user B.
For example, consider the screenshot above, which shows a Collaborative Filter Engine based on Shopify purchase data. By creating a Collaborative Filter Engine based on user purchase data, we can drive "users also bought"-type recommendations. In this case:
The bar chart shows the most popularshopify_product_idIDs across your users.
The primary way to leverage Collaborative Filter Engines is through Recommendations. While Lytics' Recommendation API, and Experience toolkit allow you to deploy Recommendation campaigns onsite or via email, the Collaborative Filter UI allows you to experiment and test out Lytics' Recommendations.
In theRecommendtab, you can fetch Recommendations for any user. Simply select the identifier field (_uidsin this case) and click on theRecommendbutton. This will request Recommendations for the selected user using the Lytics Recommendation API. The Recommended items are displayed below.
TheItem Recommendationinput allows you to fetchsimilaritems for any given item. In the example below, we are finding items similar to the item withshopify_product_id = 631195017394. This can be used to find similar products based on user behavior.
To create a new Collaborative Filter Engine, click on theNew Interest Enginebutton and click onCollaborative Filter. This will open a wizard with the following options. When creating a Collaborative Filter Engine, there are 4 fields:
Once you create your new Collaborative Filter wizard, Lytics will train a Collaborative Filter model within minutes. Once the model has finished training, the UI will be available to use, as well as Lytics' Recommendation API.

Learn about Lytics' Lookalike Audience and Propensity Modeling capabilities
Lytics'Lookalike Modelsallows marketers to leverage Machine Learning to easily create powerfulpropensity modelsandlookalike audiences. Powered by modern machine learning techniques and our comprehensive model-building pipeline, Lytics'Lookalike Modelsmake it easy for marketers to incorporate predictive data into their marketing initiatives with minimal effort.
Lytics' Lookalike Models arepropensity modelsthat can be used to predict the likelihood that a user/customer will perform a certain action. These models can be used to identify repeat customers, users likely to churn, etc. By leveraging the predictions outputted by Lytics' Lookalike Models, you can createpredictive audiencesthat can boost your marketing use cases.
Creating aLookalike Modelis as simple as selecting atargetandsourceaudience, with the goal of driving users from the source to the target (think [unknown --> known], [1-time purchaser --> repeat purchaser], etc). Once configured, Lytics will train a model based on the data accessible on user profiles, and output meaningful diagnostics and predictions to help you expand your target audience.
Some common use cases for Lookalike Models include:
Lytics' Lookalike Models incorporate a variety of modern techniques to ensure your models outperform traditional marketing methods. When building models, Lytics applies feature-reduction techniques and trains a set of Random Forests and Logistic Regression models, followed by a suite of model-tuning and cross-validation to determine the best configuration.
Unlike traditional statistical modeling approaches, Lytics Lookalike Models update user scores in real-time, so you can start targeting users not only when the model is built, but also as their behavior changes or new users are added. This means that a prediction for a user will update after every page click, email open, etc, which helps ensure that you are targeting the best users. Rather than using a static list, Predictive Audiences built from Lookalike Models provide a dynamic pool of users that will respond best when they are ready for ads or other marketing messages. You can also adjust your targeting criteria to make the best tradeoffs between reach and accuracy to maximize your marketing budgets.
Lytics also provides robust APIs for Lookalike Models, so your engineering team can quickly create and test models via the Lytics API.

Paragraphs:
First Party Modeled Audiences allows you to take a Seed List built from first-party data and expand its reach on YouTube by up to 5000x. This lets you engage a new unknown set of potential customers that are lookalikes of the known audience — and more likely to convert. The Seed List can either be an audience in your Lytics account or an audience that already exists in your Google Ads Account.
Lytics offers the only interface for configuring models, interpreting insights, and activating new audiences with this service. Scale your acquisition efforts on YouTube with:
The Seed Audience must includeat least 5000 Users, this applies to both Lytics and Google Seed Audiences.
The 5000 user limit refers to signed in, active users in Google. Even if your seed list seems large the size may not be sufficient for modeling. The seed list size is determined when Google begins modeling with the Seed Audience and the error "audience too small" will not appear in logs in the Lytics Model Summary until after the 48 hour model training period.
If you plan to use an audience that already exists in your Google Ads Account as your seed list, the following Audience types are supported:
CRM_BASEDThese display asCustomer Listsin Google Ads.
RULE_BASED These may display asWebsite VisitorsorApp Usersin Google Ads.
REMARKETINGThese display asWebsite Visitorsin Google Ads.
Note:Google Signalsmust be enabled in your Google Analytics Account if you plan to useREMARKETINGaudiences.
In Lytics, the audience selection dropdown list in the Seed Audience selection step will automatically filter out unsupported Google audience types.
Reach out to your Lytics contact for assistance ensuring all requirements above are met.
This Integration utilizes Google's Modeled Audiences API (Google documentation not publicly available) to create models, retrieve insights and activate audiences. Our Google Customer Match API integration is used to deliver a Lytics Audience as a seed list.
Step 1:Configure Oauth to access the Google Ads API for the desired Google Ads Account.Step 2:Reach out to Google team to link your desired ads account with the Lytics Ads Account (accountid: 917-485-6635). This is required to enable Lytics access to the Google Audience Service API. We use our account to create the Model and activate the Audience in your Ads Account.
This diagram shows the high level workflow for First Party Modeled Audiences. It starts in Lytics where you begin creating a model with either a Lytics audience or an audience in your Google Ads account as the seed list for the model. The audience is passed to Google which initiates the 48 hour model training process. Once that’s complete you can review the model insights in your Lytics account and decide at which threshold to activate one or multiple audiences in your Google Ads account.
Follow these steps to create a model, review model insights and activate an audience based on the model.
In your Google Ads account the activated Audience size willnotbe displayed. This is expected as Modeled Audiences are built based on the % of the YouTube population for the country associated with the model, and population is subject to change. i.e.Top 20% represents an Audience of 20% of the YouTube users in the country ranked by similarity to your Seed Audience.
Currently, deleting Google Models from Lytics is not supported. Once a Model is deleted in Google any activated audiences will not refresh (audiences refresh weekly using the existing model to re-rank the population). If you would like to have Models manually deleted from your Lytics account please reach out to Lytics Support.
Model Insights are provided to help you understand the unique characteristics of the users in your Model. These insights are generated by Google, based on what Google knows about the users. They offer a comparison of your selected threshold's Insights Category compared against that of the country-specific general YouTube population.
The Insights categories include:
Categories are shown at the following Threshold Percentages (Thresholds allow you to define which percentile of the Model to use when expanding your reach. For example, top 2.5% represents the top 2.5% of the total addressable audience that looks most like your seed audience):

Paragraphs:
To demonstrate how Lookalike Models can bring your marketing team's segmentation strategy to the next level, we've outlined how you could segment users by hand compared to how a Lookalike Model would accomplish this task. For our example use case, the goal is to identify users who are likely to buy a travel package for the summer.
How a marketer may create segmentation rules by hand:
Targeting users that match these three rules will certainly improve the efficacy of a campaign, but why stop at three rules? Are there more factors that can be used to refine this group of users?
How Lytics Lookalike Models would do it instead:
The key difference here is that a marketer may use a handful of criteria using logical heuristics to define a segment of users while Lookalike Models will look athundredsof factors including potential non-obvious, impactful criteria to define an audience of users for the same purpose.
In traditional supervised machine learning, we collect samples of data with one field represented as the target. This is what we look to model or "classify". Some examples of real-world classifiers are predicting whether an email is spam or not, predicting if the weather tomorrow will be cloudy or sunny, classifying a news article as happy or sad, or classifying an image as a dog or not a dog. We do this same thing in Lytics' Lookalike Modeling but you get to choose what the target we want to predict is. This works by providing two audiences: atargetandsource.
The target audience is the group of users you want to model and predict, i.e. the users you want to find more of. Most of the time this audience will represent users that have done something favorable that is worth repeating by finding more users highly likely to repeat this favorable event. For example, users who provided their email on a newsletter signup, high LTV users, users who purchased a product, etc. Getting the target audience in order is step #1 before creating the model. This audience defines the basis of the model or the model's objective. Aside from "positive" events, you can also model users you might want to suppress like users who have churned. If the data is in Lytics, you can model it.
The source audience is the group of users to find lookalikes for, i.e. the users you want to target in campaigns after creating the model. For example, if we chose users with email as the target, then targeting unknown users would make sense as the source. You could also make the source audience users who have viewed a certain line of products, users who have been active within the last 90 days, etc. The source should be adjacent to the target. More information on choosing the right source and target audiences can be foundhere.
Once a source audience and target audience are chosen, Lytics handles all the heavy lifting of building, optimizing, and deploying the model. For each model, Lytics automates the (1) feature selection, (2) model training and validation, and (3) scalable real-time prediction, which allows you to spend less time wrangling data to build models, and more time to create better experiences for your customers.
Feature selection is the process of identifying which features (or fields) to include in a machine-learning model. While all user profile data is accessible for use in building Lookalike Models, manually identifying which features to include can be a tedious and time-consuming process if there are hundreds or thousands of fields. Lytics provides an option calledAuto-Tunewhich uses intelligent feature engineering to select the most predictive features across all the available features.
When training models, Lytics utilizes three model types:Random Forests,Gradient Boosting MachinesandLogistic Regression. Under the hood, Lytics trains dozens of models using different parameters and hyper-parameters to optimize the model-building process.
Lytics Lookalike Models update user scores in real-time, so you can start targeting users immediately once the model is building, but also as their behavior changes or new users are added. Rather than using a static list, Predictive Audiences built from Lookalike Models provide a dynamic pool of users that will respond best when they are ready for ads or other marketing messages. You can also adjust your targeting criteria to make the best tradeoffs between reach and accuracy to maximize your marketing budgets.
To create your first Lookalike Model, please refer to theBuilding Lookalike Modelsdocument. You may also choose to use theLytics Lookalike Model APIto create a model. An example of creating a Model via the API is provided below.

This opens up the lookalike model builder.
For most use cases, building a model by setting the basic configuration parameters is sufficient. The only required parameters are the selection of a source and target audience, which arevery important for building a usable model.
If you select audiences that are too dissimilar, the model may be unable to find lookalikes in the source audience.Learn more about selecting the right audiences for your use case. The size of each audience is also important.
When building a Lookalike Model, your source and target audience must have a minimum of 25 users and a maximum of 20 million users.
If your selected audience exceeds the maximum size, you can add filters to refine it. For example, if the source audience is “Unknown users” you could add a filter for “Active in the last 30 days” to ensure you aren’t targeting unknown users with stale cookie identifiers.
The basic model parameters are defined below.
For additional model configuration, select theAdvanced Options.

The Lookalike Model summary view consists of three tabs each containing valuable information about your model. The initialSummarytab displays key metrics about the model such as accuracy, reach, and its usage. TheConfigurationtab displays the options selected to build the model, and theDiagnosticstab displays the data science values of the model useful for debugging.
The model summary dashboard surfaces the key metrics of a model. Here you can see a model’s accuracy and reach, how the source and target audiences overlap, the important features that contribute to the model, what audiences are using the model, and any diagnostic and troubleshooting messages.
At the top of the summary page, you will see a tag indicating whether your model is healthy or unhealthy. Lytics determines model health based on the model’s ability to make accurate predictions -- predictions from unhealthy models should not be trusted.  Models are considered unhealthy if the accuracy is low (with an R2value less than 0.1), or if the model is overfit (with an R2value greater than 0.975).
Accuracy describes the precision of a Lookalike Model's predictions — that is, how closely a model's predictions match actual outcomes during model training. Models with higher accuracy can be used to narrowly target the strongest lookalike candidates, which are better applied to later stages of your funnel.
Reach describes the relative size of a Lookalike Model's addressable audience. Higher reach models can broadly target many users, which are better applied to earlier stages of your funnel.
The model prediction section displays the size of your source and target audiences and charts the predictions for those audiences. The X axis represents the prediction value and the Y axis represents relative density. The shape of the graph is most important, which indicates the amount of overlap between your source and target audiences. SeeAccuracy vs. Reachfor examples of how different trade-offs between accuracy and reach will look in the model predictions graph.
Model feature importance indicates features among users likely to convert from the source to the target audience. The chart displays the relative importance of these features according to the model calculation ordered from most to least important. Identifying these features may give you a better understanding of the similarities between your source and target audiences. You may even opt to include some of these features when building an audience with this model.
Model usage displays a list of audiences built that are utilizing this model for targeting as well as a button to create a new Predictive Audience with this model. Campaigns run with Predictive Audiences from a healthy Lookalike Model perform very well, providing higher conversion rates. Clicking theCreate Predictive Audiencebutton will take you to the audience builder, pre-populated with a rule utilizing the prediction score user field for your model. More details on building these predictive audiences can be foundhere
The Diagnostics and Troubleshooting section provides messages pertaining to the performance and status of your Lookalike Model. These messages are categorized as warnings, errors, or information. Warnings and error messages may indicate why your model is unhealthy or provide suggestions on how to improve its performance.
To resolve these messages, try changing the source or target audiences, or any of the other configurations as suggested. More help debugging these messages can be foundhere
TheConfigurationtab displays the settings used when creating the model.
TheDiagnosticstab provides an advanced view into a Lookalike Model's performance and can help provide assurance that the model has a robust statistical foundation. This information is helpful for technical users looking to gain extra insight into the data science behind this Lookalike Model.

Once a Lookalike Model is built and users are scored (make sure theModel Training Onlyoption is unchecked or on the Model Summary page pressActivatein the top right), you can create Predictive Audiences with different prediction decision thresholds for the model or percentiles based on the predictions.
From theLookalike Modelslist view, click the model you'd like to use to build a Predictive Audience. Then find theModel Usagesection and clickCreate Predictive Audience.
This opens the Audience Builder. All Lookalike Models are keys under the user fieldLookalike Model Predictions. The values are the model prediction, interpreted as probabilities on a scale of 0-1. Users closer to 0 represent a low likelihood to look like users in the target audience and vice versa for users closer to 1.
By default, this rule is populated with the model'sDecision Threshold, computed as the equilibrium prediction score for both Accuracy and Reach (or maximizing both Accuracy and Reach). However you can adjust this threshold as you like or add additional rules before saving the audience. SeeImproving Lookalike Modelsfor tips on adjusting theDecision Threshold. Any audiences built using the audience prediction score for your model will display in the model usage module.
Another option to build a Predictive Audience is by using theLookalike Model Percentilesfield. Similar to theLookalike Model Predictionsfield, the Lookalike Models are keys for theLookalike Model Percentilesfield.
The percentile for a model represents the value at which a percentage of the predictions fall below. For example, the 80th percentile represents the prediction score at which 80% of all other scores fall below, or more simply put; the top 20% of users. Percentiles help account for the shape of a model's prediction distribution, as it can sometimes be hard to determine who the best users are based solely on the prediction scores, if the distribution is skewed is any direction.

Paragraphs:
The Lookalike Model dashboard provides visibility of the health, status, and usage of your Lookalike Models. It lists all models in your account allowing you to search, sort, and view the summary, configuration, and diagnostics information of individual models. The dashboard is also your starting point to create new Lookalike Models.
The model health chart displays the total number of models and how many are considered to be healthy or unhealthy. A model is considered healthy if it can make accurate predictions.

The model status displays how many of your models have been activated. An activated model is currently generating a score for that model on user profiles, meaning its predictions will be available as user fields for audience targeting. A model can be activated or deactivated on the model summary page.
The model usage metric shows the percentage of all your audiences that are using activated models. The percentage of audiences using models highlights the granularity and focus of your audiences. Audiences using healthy Lookalike Models have more focused targeting and personalization allowing for messages tailored to the predicted members.
The model table lists all the models in your account. You can use the search bar to find any model by its name. You can also sort by name, status, if the model is active or healthy, and when the models were last modified. Click any model to open its summary for more detailed information about that model.

Paragraphs:
Building effective Lookalike Models is an iterative process. To help with these iterations, Lytics provides diagnostic messages that identify ways to improve your model performance.
In general, these model messages can help you both select the best source and target audiences for your model, and create the best Predictive Audience from your model.
Most of the time, Lookalike Models are built to drive users toward conversion. This flow should be reflected in how you consider selecting the right source and target audiences to build your model.
When defining your source and target audiences, try selecting audiences that are at adjacent stages in your customer lifecycle, rather than at divergent ends of your funnel (like Brand New Visitors and Multi-purchase Premium Customers). The diagram below represents audience similarity on a spectrum of model performance.

Consider the following examples of audiences with different levels of similarity.
If you’ve selected divergent or overlapping audiences in your model, you will see diagnostic messages to guide you to select audiences that are more adjacent.
Most Predictive Audiences are built by identifying users in the source audience who have a high model score. This "high score" is called theDecision Threshold, and in most cases is around 0.5. To adjust the reach of the audience you’re building, you might consider using a different decision threshold.
Diagnostic messages may suggest creating audiences using different decision thresholds, but you are always free to make the decision threshold whatever makes the most sense to generate a Predictive Audience of the right size.
Most of the time, diagnostic messages for unhealthy models will suggest building a model with different source or target audiences. Occasionally, you might see a diagnostic message suggesting that a model should be built with different features.
The model could not find sufficient signal in the features provided. Try either using Auto Tune or providing additional features.
In these cases, the underlying model didn't have enough of a signal in the data provided to be able to predict target behavior.
Imagine that you're an online retailer trying to build Lookalike Models for multi-purchasers, but you build a model that doesn't have any purchase data.  Or you want to build an email churn model, but you don't have any email data in your model.  In these cases, regardless of how your source and target audiences are constructed, your model would be missing the underlying signal required to make a successful model.
You could either manually select additional fields to include in the Model Builder, or you can use theAuto Tuneoption on the model to have the machine attempt to automatically identify the best field candidates to include in the model.
All Lookalike Models try to balance a trade-off between accuracy and reach, which are two of the most important indicators of how your model will perform.
As a general principle, you cannot optimize for both accuracy and reach. Deciding which one to focus on will depend on your marketing use case.
Optimizing your Lookalike Model for accuracy is typically used for targeting later stages of your funnel. This enables you to be more precise, with the trade-off of reaching fewer users. By identifying users who are most likely to convert, you can optimize their high-touch experiences to drive engagement, improve conversion rates, and increase customer lifetime value.

In the example above, the model has a high accuracy score of 9 and a low reach score of 1. The shape of the model predictions graph has little overlap between the source and target audience, which indicates less similarity between the users of those audiences. However, for the select users that fall into the area of overlap, they have a higher likelihood of converting.
Optimizing your Lookalike Model for reach is most applicable for targeting users in earlier stages of your funnel. This will allow you to reach more users, with the trade-off of being less precise. You can think of this as "casting an intelligently wide net". By identifying users who are least likely to convert, you can focus your marketing resources on the users whoarelikely to convert, improving conversion rates and maximizing your budget spend.

In the example above, the model has a low accuracy score of 2 and a high reach score of 8. The shape of the model predictions graph has a good amount of overlap between the source and target audience, which indicates more similarity between the users of those audiences. Therefore, you will be able to reach more users in the source audience, but they have a lower likelihood of converting compared to a model with higher accuracy.
When balancing the trade-off between accuracy and reach, consider the sum of accuracy and reach to determine a model’s fitness to be used.  See the table below for a quick estimation of your model's fitness to be used.
In the first two screenshots shared, each model had a sum score of 10 for accuracy and reach (9 and 1, 2 and 8 respectively). Therefore, both models would be considered "good" but they are optimized for different use cases. For a comparison, see the model below that has a moderate accuracy score of 5 and a moderate reach score of 5.

Paragraphs:
Destinations are where the rubber meets the road. They provide push button ease for delivering the highly targeted audiences constructed from rich behavioral insights to all of your marketing delivery tools. This section will cover the tools and interface for managing data sync with your preferredDestination.
The landscape in which your consumers interact is broad. To ensure Lytics makes it easy to both collect and deliver essential data, insights, and audiences, we have a variety ofintegration options.
DataDestinationintegrations are managed primarily by Decision Engine but may also be available in Conductor to streamline the delivery of raw events and profiles to your warehouse. Creating aDestinationis simple:
NewSourceintegrations are added from the Decision Engine interface by first navigating to theJobsoption under theDatasection in the main navigation.

From there, you'll click "+ Create New Job" at the top of the list and enter the wizard to guide you through the creation process.

EachDestinationis first categorized by the provider, making it easy to narrow down the channel you'd like to integrate with. To select a provider, click the tile representing your desired provider, such as "Google."

With the provider selected, we'll surface the various ways you can integrate with that particular provider. This will vary significantly by the provider.

Each provider and job type may require additional authorization to finalize the connection. On the "select authorization" step, you can either select an existing authorization or create a new one. When creating a new authorization, you will be asked to provide the required credentials, such as key and secret, to proceed.

The final step lets you provide the specific configuration details for your chosen provider and job type. Again, the options supported by each provider will vary greatly, and provider-specificintegration detailsshould be leveraged to determine the optimal approach.

Once you have one or more Destination jobs running, they will be accessible from the Jobs list view, as pictured below. This view provides quick access to essential details:

Detailed states are provided to understand better what is happening in the background during a job's lifecycle. These states will vary by job but include:
For more information on job states or troubleshooting failed jobs, seejob processing.
Clicking on any of the items in the Source list will navigate to its dedicated summary view for greater detail. This summary provides all the relevant information about each job you've created in Lytics and an entry point to alter the configuration or status.
At the top of the Job Summary page, you’ll find the following quick-access information:
You can edit the name and description of an existing job from its summary page to improve the organization and clarity of your account's list of jobs.
The details section displays your job's current configuration. This includes details such as the authorization used, where data is coming from, which data is being pulled in, etc.

The Logs section records the history of events for this job, details about the work completed, and the time each job was run. The logs are helpful to ensure your work is running as expected and for troubleshooting if any issues arise. Below are descriptions of the job events you may see in the logs.

Paragraphs:
Lytics definesGoalsas high-level objectives that measure marketing success, such as improving conversion rates, decreasing churn, and increasing customer lifetime value (LTV).
The Lytics Goals Canvas provides a framework for moving your customers through their lifecycle and driving them towards your brand’s top-level marketing goals. This approach allows you as a marketer to focus on defining your Goal and creating relevant Experiences that allow customers to take any path to get there.
The Lytics Goals Canvas is oriented around a few concepts: Goals, Experiences, and Stages.
Lytics Goals allow you to guide users through highly personalized experiences that increase customer lifetime value and drive progress towards your primary business goals.
You will use the Lytics Canvas to create, edit, and monitor your Goals. Navigate toGoalsand clickNew Goalin the top right of your screen to create a new one.
The first step in configuring a Goal is picking your starting audience. Select this audience by clicking the "Audience" button (blue circle) on the left-hand side of the Lytics Canvas. You can choose an existing audience or you can build a new one by clickingNew audience.

Lytics recommends keeping this starting audience as broad as possible, as there will be ample opportunity to add filters and refine your targeting through Stages and Experiences.
You will be able to change this audience at any time, although that may drastically affect target audiences and reporting metrics.
Each Stage represents a significant step towards your Goal, as defined by a conversion event. A common conversion event is finding "known users" by collecting email addresses on a newsletter sign-up or registration page.
Stages contain Experiences that give users opportunities to complete conversion events in various channels, such as on your website, through an email newsletter or Facebook ad. A Goal can have one or more Stages, based on the needs of your use case. After defining the first conversion event, you will see an option toAdd a Stage.

Users move to the next Stage when they complete the selected conversion event. Goals are always configured so that users move through your Stages from left-to-right as they complete conversion events. Keep in mind that users don't always complete conversion events in the order anticipated, which means they may end up skipping a Stage. If you want to prevent this, you can include additional logic in your conversion event definition.
And remember, users can never be in more than one Stage per Goal at a time.
The Experience drawer contains Experience templates and Experiences that aren't part of a Goal yet. Add any of these to your Goal by dragging them into a Stage. Open the drawer by clicking the icons labeledExperience templateorExperience.

If you drag an Experience that is activated into your Goal, you will need to pause it before being able to save your Goal. You can do so from the Lytics Canvas by hovering over the Experience card and then clicking thePausebutton.

Once you're ready to reactivate the Experience in the context of the Goal, clickResume.

Much like prioritizing Experiences within Stages, you can also prioritize Goals. Since membership is not mutually exclusive (that is, users can be moving towards multiple Goals at a time), it is possible that a user will be eligible for two simultaneous Experiences from two different Goals. When that happens, Lytics will take into account Goal priority when determining which Experience will be delivered. The higher on the Goal list, the higher the priority.
Stages are the individual steps that move customers towards your Goal. Users in your overall audience will automatically enter the first Stage. When a user completes the first conversion event, they will move to the second Stage, and so on through the last Stage within your Goal. A user can only be in one Stage at a time.

Conversion events within Lytics are behavior-based audiences such as purchasers, highly engaged users, known users, etc. These determine which users are eligible for the Experiences within a Stage. When a user fulfills conversion event applied to a Stage, they move to the next Stage until they reach the last conversion event for that Goal.
If users have completed the conversion event applied to a Stage, theywill notbe eligible for any of the Experiences in the Stage. This prevents overlapping targeting such as continuing to show a Facebook ad to a user who has already converted on a particular campaign.

To assign a conversion event to a Stage, click the “Trophy” icon to open a menu of available conversion events. A red dot next to the “Trophy” icon indicates a Stage that still needs to be assigned a conversion event. A conversion event is required to populate the metrics for a Stage.
Lytics tracks three key metrics to measure Stage performance:Potential reach,Converted, andConversion rate.
The table below defines these metrics and how often they are updated in the Lytics UI.
Experiences can be added to a Stage in several ways. You can add an Experience directly to a Stage by clickingAdd a new Experiencealong the bottom of a Stage.You can drag an Experience template into a Stage, which will create an Experience with boilerplate settings to use as a starting point. You can also drag an existing Experience into a Stage, either from another Stage or from the Experience drawer.
Note:This will significantly change the audience for that Experience.
To ensure that your audience receives the right amount of messaging, each user will only be eligible for one Experience per Stage at a time. That means that no matter how many web modals you add to a Stage, your audience members will only see one at a time. Lytics won't just choose one at random though; there is a sophisticated decision engine that determines which Experience will be delivered to the end user. Part of the input into that engine is the order of Experiences within a Stage. The closer to the top of a Stage an Experience is, the more likely it is that it will be delivered to the end user.
You can think of the Lytics Canvas as an intelligent audience builder. When you create new Stages and add conversion events, you are effectively building new audiences based on the desired flow of users towards achieving your Goal. Unlike drip campaigns or more traditional journey builders, Lytics doesn't require you to build complicated audiences. Keep them simple, and the Lytics Canvas will do the heavy lifting for you.
The following tips will assist you when building and selecting audiences for the conversion events and Experiences within your Goals.
When you’re creating audiences to use in a Goal, it’s helpful to think about each audience as a "building block" rather than a complete definition of who you want to be targeting.
Below are examples of good building block audiences:
All users
Users who have shared their email address
Users who have purchased something
Building block audiences work best when they don’t exclude anyone. It can be tempting to try to exclude users from a building block audience — for example, excluding “Known Users” from “All” in order to target only anonymous users — but the Lytics Canvas will do this for you automatically if one of your future conversion events is the audience "Known Users".
NOTE:If you do end up doing this yourself, you can create a “dead-end” path, where users are unable to progress due to the definition of the automatically generated audiences, which are explained in more detail below.
There is one important exception to this rule.If you want tosuppressa subset of your entire audience from your Goal, you can exclude them from your "overall audience". This will work so long as the exclusion rule isnotrelated to the downstream conversion events. An “overall audience” is the first audience you select on the Lytics Canvas, which is represented by the left-most blue circle as shown below.
For example, if you used the audience below as your overall audience, you would exclude "Realtors" from the entire Goal. This will not create a "dead-end" if none of the subsequent Stages have conversion events dependent on the "Realtors" criteria.
All users, excluding Realtors
If you want to target with more granularity than a Stage audience allows, you can add a filter on individual Experiences within a Stage.

This is a great point to target users based on behavior, such as engagement level. The audience you choose here will be added to your Stage audience with an "AND" statement.
A common pattern may be that you want any users who converted on the Experiences in your Stage to enter the next Stage. Learn how to target users based on Experience interactions to build a conversion event like this.
Now that you've learned how to select and build audiences, take a deeper look into how the Lytics Canvas uses these audiences to help users flow towards your Goal.
The Lytics Canvas automatically generates audiences based on your selected conversion events. For example, let's say you want to create a the first Stage to target users who haven’t shared their email address, and the second Stage will target known users who haven’t purchased yet.
Even though you haven’t explicitly created an audience for users who haven’t shared their email, or users who haven’t purchased, Lytics will create these audiences for you. This example would look as follows in the UI:
The following graphic shows how the Lytics Canvas takes your simple building blocks and creates more refined audiences.See the full size diagram.
Remember, if you exclude converted users on a building block audience, it can cause problems and prevent users from moving between Stages. Let the Lytics Canvas do the work for you!
Stage audiences aremutually exclusive, meaning a user can only be in one Stage at a time. This is a result of the automatic audience building done by the Lytics Canvas.
If a user in “Unknown Users” shares their email and now qualifies for “Known users” they will automatically move into that Stage without any manual intervention.
The Goal Intelligence Report provides a holistic view of how your existing campaigns are contributing towards the marketing goal you selected during the onboarding process. This report will help you answer questions about how effectively your marketing campaigns are driving conversions, how many engaged customers you have, and whether you are producing the right content for your users.
The Goal Intelligence Report contains modules that focus on answering a specific marketing question. Each module is described below, along with definitions for the associated metrics and how often they are updated.

The Goal Progres module contains three top-level metrics for the campaigns you’ve imported into Lytics. Use this summary to measure how your campaigns are working together to achieve your goal.
The Experience Performance module gives a summary view of all the campaigns you imported into Lytics including the conversion rate of each campaign, and how much this conversion is impacting your marketing goal.
Use these metrics to prompt discovery into your campaign performance. Select an Experience from the list to view its specific Intelligence Report to surface additional actions and recommendations.
The Connected Customers module shows what percentage of your users are actively engaged on multiple channels. Lytics defines Connected Customers as users who are identified on two or more channels, and who are consistently engaged with your brand as measured by the Lytics Momentum Score.
Connected Customers are valuable to your business. Use this KPI to create a stronger base of users who are more likely to convert on current and future campaigns.
The Content Classification module shows a list of the topics, documents, and relevance scores for the content used across your connected channels. Lytics automatically analyzes the topics within your website content and determines user-level affinities for those topics, which can help you decide what content to produce.
Use these metrics to ensure you are creating the right content to engage your target audience.
The Content Recommendation module surfaces content that is likely to resonate with your users based on their past behavior. Lytics analyzes the content on your website through the Lytics JavaScript Tag. The relevancy percentage is calculated by determining the total number of users with various content affinities and comparing this to the total number of users within the audience that visited your site.
Create and deliver content that aligns with your users’ interests to drive engagement and conversions.
Connected Customers represent the number of active users who are engaged with your brand across multiple channels. This is a Lytics proprietary KPI that offers a quick and comprehensive understanding of the performance of your account’s identity resolution strategy.
Lytics defines a Connected Customer as a user who has:
You can find the Connected Customer KPI in the Goal Intelligence Report. These  metrics come from a Lytics audience that is automatically generated under-the-hood using the criteria described above.

Connected Customers are valuable to your business. This KPI helps you understand how many Connected Customers you have and the impact of your marketing programs on user engagement. Lytics helps you gain more Connected Customers by refining your audience targeting and messaging strategies to improve engagement and ultimately increase the ROI for your marketing efforts.
Track your Connected Customers for a pulse on engagement levels across your active campaigns. Use this KPI to create a stronger base of users who are more likely to convert on current and future campaigns. You can also activate this Connected Customer audience in your downstream marketing tools such as Facebook, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, and more.

Paragraphs:
Lytics Experiences have replaced the legacy Personalize functionality, as such Personalize campaigns are no longer supported by Lytics. If your account has not yet migrated from Personalize to Experiences, you may access our legacy documentationhere.
Experiences allow you to present tailored messaging to specific audiences. These messages can be on your website using Lytics Experiences, appear on a third-party ad platform like Facebook, or emails delivered through an email service provider like SendGrid.
Since you can control the audience being targeted, you can deliver Experiences that make sense for some users but not others. You can even recommend products or content based on each user's unique content affinities and behaviors. Experiences allow you to treat your customers as individuals rather than over-messaging them with generic offers and newsletters.
Common uses of Experiences include:
You can create and import new Experiences as well as browse existing Experiences (including those that are associated with a Goal) by navigating to theExperiencestab
The set up for each Experience is slightly different, so whether you are creating an on-site Lytics Experiences or connecting to one of our out-of-the-box Integrations, the simplest way to get started with experiences is to create a new Experience and allow our Experience Editor to navigate you through each of the steps.
Within theExperiencestab in the Lytics app, you will find a list of all of your Experiences. From this view you can
See below for more information around each of these activities.
Create a new Experience within theExperiencestab by clicking theAdd Experiencesbutton near the top of the page. Selecting theNewoption will guide you through the Experience Editor steps for any Experience (Lytics,Out-of-the-Box Integrations, orGeneric)
TheNewoption allows you to select from the full list of providers.
If you want to import external marketing initiativesfrom out-of-the-box integrations that support Experiences, you can do so within theExperiencestab as well. Click theAdd Experiencesbutton near the top of the page and select theImportoption to be guided through the Experience Editor steps for these supported integrations.
TheImportoption navigates you to directly to a list of the out-of-the-box integration providers.

To the right of the Experience list you can filter Experiences based on their...
Imported Experiences that haven't been activated yet will be tagged as Externally Managed
Sort:
By default, the list of Experiences is sorted byName. If you choose to sort by dateLast modifiedinstead, your preferences will be saved for the next time you visit.
An Experience status indicates what life-cycle the Experience is in and the health of whether it is exporting a Lytics audience to a third-party tool in real-time.
Below is a complete list of Experience statuses:
Draft:A complete, or partially complete Experience that has not yet been activated.
Active:An Experience that can be seen by your users (and has not passes its end date).
Paused:An Experience that was activated but has been paused. To edit an Experience that has been running, you must pause it first.
Scheduled:An Experience that will be activated at a start date set in the future.
Externally Managed:Animported Experiencefrom a third party tool that hasn't been configured with a Lytics audience. Complete the configuration by editing the Experience in the Experience editor.
Ended:An Active Experience that has passed its end date.
Error:An Experience that failed to export audience data to the appropriate tool.
Warning:An Experience that encountered issues when attempting to export audience data to a third party tool. It may recover on its own, or proceed to an error status after a number of failed attempts to export data.
Once you have created or imported Experiences they will be populated as a list within theExperiencestab. Click on an Experiences from the list to enter the Experiences summary. From this summary page you can...
See below for more information about each of these activities.
Within the Experience summary you will find important information about your Experience. The summary includes:
From the Experience summary page you are able manage the activation of individual Experiences using the following buttons on the righthand side of the summary page.
Within theExperiencessection of the Lytics app, you can edit an existing Experience by clicking on the desired Experience. This will navigate you to the Experience summary page. Here you can click on theEditbutton to enter the Experience Editor for this Experience.
You cannot edit an Experience while it is activated, so you will not be able to enter the Experience editor at that point. If you need to edit an Active Experience, you canPauseit from the Experience summary page.
Once you have made and saved your edits, you can thenResumethe experience from the Experience summary page
To delete an experience from Lytics, click on the Experience you wish to delete from within the Experiences list. You will be navigated to the Experience summary page where you can delete the experience from the options menu.
You will be asked to confirm that you wish to delete the experience, click theDelete permanentlybutton to complete the deletion.
The Experience editor is used to create, save, edit, and activate marketing Experiences. Combined with audiences created in theaudience builder, sophisticated Experiences can be built to deliver the right message to your users at the right time.
To enter the Experience editor, you can eitheradd an experienceoredit an experience. The available steps of the Experience editor are dictated bythe Experience provideryou select.
Use Lytics Experiences to personalize a website with modals, slide outs, sticky bars, etc. This does not require connecting to another tool.
If you are creating or importing a new Experience, you will be given a choice of Experience providers - providers are the tools that deliver your Experience. The selection of Lytics as a provider will prompt you to select a tactic from a list of options. The following tactics are available for Lytics Experiences:
Once you've chosen your tactic, the Experience editor will take you though each step.
Choosing a URL to promote is the first step in the Experience editor for a Drive Traffic Experience of theLytics provider. This step does not apply to Experiences of any other tactic or Provider.
This step allows you to enter the destination you want to link as a call to action in your Drive Traffic Experience. The protocol is preset to<https://> but can be changed to<http://>. Enter the rest of the URL into the input field.
Specific to theCollect Leadstactic of Lytics Experiences, this step is for selecting what information you collect on the form.
Here you will configure which form fields will be shown and thus what information you capture about your user.
TheRecommend ContentExperience type is used to surface content (an article, a blog post, a product page) to visitors. Each recommendation is personalized to the individual. This could be used to keep visitors engaged by surfacing what to read next, or assist casual perusers by prompting a starting point.
Furthermore, the Experience can be configured to only a set of pages or a subset of your total audience. This allows you to limit the recommendations from showing up on auxiliary pages like the home page, company page, or checkout page. It can also only be shown to users with high usage. This way low usage visitors can be targeted with a more aggressive campaign.
Choosing content is the first step for a Recommend Content Experience.Lytics provides a variety of filters and options for tailoring what content can be recommended and how the recommendation algorithm should rank the content.
A content collection allows you to limit the scope of documents that can be recommended by your Experience. If you're creating a summer seasonal experience, for example, you wouldn't want articles that are out of season. A content collection is how you define which articles are appropriate to recommend.
Use theSelect a content collectiondropdown to choose an existing collection or to create a new one. Clicking onNew content collectionwill take you to thecollection builder. The state of your Experience will be saved, and after creating your new collection, you will automatically be returned to the Experience editor.
The Lytics content recommendation engine allows you to configure the way in which the Experience will recommend content.
The recommendation settings work within the limits set by the content collection. If your content collection includes articles published six to twelve months ago and you choose theRecently Publishedmethod, then the Experience will begin recommending six-month-old articles, which are the most recently-published articles within the collection.
Recommendation method
The recommendation methods control how the recommendation engine ranks the content.
New content only
TheOnly recommend content the user has not seen?checkbox controls whether previously viewed content will be included among the recommendations. Leave this setting checked to ensure that a user won't be recommended content they have viewed in the past.
Shuffle content
TheShuffle content on each page load?checkbox controls whether a user should be recommended different content if they encounter the Experience again (e.g. after reloading). Check this setting to vary the content that is recommended on subsequent requests or leave it unchecked to show the single best recommendation.
The design step is present in the editor for all Experiences of theLytics provider. It lets you customize the appearance and content of the widget displayed to your users on your website. This step offers layout and position options as well as a custom CSS option.

First, choose your Experience's layout. There are five different layout options, and their availability depends on the tactic you selected.
Different content fields are supported by different Experience layouts or tactics.
Including an image for your Experience is optional, the image will be shown above or beside the messaging of the Experience. Any image you include must be hosted publicly as this input takes a URL but not an upload.
Experience widgets can be displayed in different positions depending on their layout. The available positions will show up as a darker gray while the active position is blue.

There are three ways to theme your Experience.
Choose a theme: Lytics provides Light and Dark themes you can select.
Build a custom theme: There are eight color options available to build a theme in the Experience editor:
Use Custom CSS: Use your own custom CSS to match the Experience's styling with your site's design. Experiences are built using the Pathfora SDK.Read about using custom CSS with Pathfora.
The audience step in the Experience editor allows you to configure the target audience for your Experience. Use the dropdown to select from among your pre-built audiences. ClickNew audienceat the bottom of the dropdown menu if you need to build a new one and you will be directed to theaudience builder.
This step is required for standalone Experiences, such as a one-off email campaign or a seasonal ad promotion. Once you have selected an audience,Potential Reachdisplays how many people will be eligible to receive this Experience.

This step is optional if your Experience is part of aGoal on the Lytics Canvas. Here you can add additional filtering to your Experience. Any audience you choose will be combined with the Stage audience, resulting in a more targeted Experience with a smaller audience. You can also leave this blank if you don't want additional targeting.

ThePotential reachdisplays how many people will be eligible to receive this Experience. TheStage coveragemetric displays what percentage of the stage will be eligible to receive this Experience.
If your Experience is not providing the desired results, you can pause your Experience and target a new audience. Just keep in mind that the metrics are for the Experience and won't explicitly indicate changes you made. You can also make changes directly to the target audience, and the potential reach of the Experience will be adjusted automatically.

When creating a newRecommend ContentExperience, you will see a content alignment score in theTarget Audiencestep of the Experience Editor. Lytics calculates the alignment percentage by comparing the affinities of your target audience to the affinities in your selected content collection.
Use the alignment score information to ensure you are recommending content or products that are relevant for your customers, which can help improve engagement and conversion rates of your marketing campaigns.
For a quick demonstration of using theaffinity alignmentscore while building a content recommendation, watch thisvideo.
The display step is present in the editor for all Experiences of theLytics provider. Use the Display Step to set where and when the Experience will show up for your users. Set rules for which URL(s) an Experience can be displayed on, the triggers for displaying it, the frequency with which it appears, and the date range during which the Experience is available to show.

Prior to activating your Experience, ensure that the display URL is included in yourURL Allowlist for Orchestrateaccount setting.
Appears on rules are anoptionaltool used to specify which webpages within your site the Experience will (or will not) be shown on. This can be a fixed list of pages or expressions that match many pages. There are four URL-matching strategies offered, and rules can be used in combination.
Each of these URL-matching strategies can be used to create a rule determining when the Experience is shown withShow onselected, or to specify the cases where the Experience shouldnotbe displayed withHide on.
Consider the following use cases, and some suggested solutions using the appears on rules.

The Advanced Display Options allow you to respond to the user's interaction with your site, using the state of their active web session to determine when an Experience is displayed. These areall optionaland can be used in combination.

When using triggers in combination, note that the conditions function as an ALL conditions met, not ANY condition met. If you set an Experience toShow after 5 page viewsand toShow after 70% page scroll, when your user scrolls to 70% of the third page, the Experience willnotshow because only one of the two conditions have been met.
If you set an Experience toShow up to 5 times per user, everandShow up to 2 times per user per session, and a user is shown the Experience twice each on their first two sessions, for their third session they will be shown the Experience for the final time.
If you set an Experience's frequency toShow up to 2 times per user per sessionand a trigger ofShow after 5 page views, your user will see the Experience upon reaching the sixth page, again on reaching the seventh page, and not again during their session.
These are the same options as above, but applied to when the user has seen the Experience butnotclicked the CTA.
Pathfora is a very powerful client-side personalization SDK. In addition, it is open-sourced. Because anyone is invited to contribute to Pathfora, providing clear controls for all features is impossible. As a result, we provide a technical but friendly interface for using "overrides." Overrides allow you to leverage the full power of pathfora for functionality such as custom load and callback handlers and advanced customization and styling.
In the coming weeks, we'll extend our documentation to outline several common patterns for leveraging overrides. For those looking for initial information, don't hesitate to contact your primary account contacts. For others that are already leveraging overrides directly via our APIs, you will also see a representation and area for managing those overrides directly within the "Advanced Settings" in the Experience wizard, as pictured below.

Set the date range for when the Experience will be shown to your users. The start date will be populated with the current day, so that your Experience will start immediately without you needing to set anything.
You can set a start date in the future and Activate the Experience ahead of time; it will have a "scheduled" status and then switch automatically to "active" on the start date.
The end date is not required. If you do not set an end date, the Experience will run indefinitely as long as it is active. End dates cannot be in the past, nor can they precede the start date.
The date range is inclusive, so if you set a start date of 3/21/2022 and an end date of 3/23/2022, the experience will run for 3 days. On 3/24/2022, the Experience will switch from "active" status to "ended" on its own and users will no longer see it.
The review step is the final step for all Experiences of theLytics provider. It provides an at-a-glance view of everything you've chosen for your Lytics Experience.

Though there is nothing youneedto do on this step, it does give you an opportunity to check that all your selections are listed as you expect before you activate the Experience.
Use thePreviewbutton in the top right of the screen to see how your experience will look when it's active on your site. Simply enter the URL you want to see the preview on in the modal that appears, and you'll be directed to your site but with the experience running as it will once it becomes activated. From this preview state you can get a better idea of how/when the experience is triggered and see what your users will see.

The URL you entermust matchtheappears onconditions you set in the display step. The target audience, however, is ignored for previewing ease.
When you first enter the Experience editor, you will see aSavebutton in the top right corner which allows you to save your progress at any time.
If you have made it to the final step within the Experience Editor (Review for Lytics Experiences), theNext Stepbutton will now be aSave and Exitbutton. Click on this button to save and exit your Experience. If you have previously saved your Experience and made no other changes this will simply allow you to exit the Experience Editor.
After the Experience has been saved once, the button will become aSavebutton that is only enabled when you make further changes.
If you have not yet named the Experience at the time you save, you will be prompted to do so at this time, and the Experience's tactic will be suggested as a default.
When creating a new Experience within Lytics, name it including the purpose and any categorization (e.g. Drive sales: Holiday). When working with existing Experiences from your third party tools, name the imported experiences on Lytics with the same/similar names as in the external tool.
Unsaved Experiences
At any point you may discard your unsaved Experience by clicking on the Close button (X) in the top left corner of the Experience Editor and then clickingConfirmwhen asked "Are you sure you want to discard unsaved changes?"
You may also select the Delete option from the more options (...) menu in the top right corner of the Experience Editor and click Delete permanently when prompted.
Both methods will remove you from the Experience Editor without saving.
Previously Saved Experiences
If you have previously saved the Experience and have returned to make edits, you may discard all changes you've made since your last save by clicking on the Close button (X) in the top left corner of the Experience Editor (and clickingConfirmwhen prompted) or by selecting theDiscard Changesoption from the more options menu (...) in the top right column.
The former will discard changes and exit the Experience Editor. The latter method will allow you discard changes, but stay within the Experience Editor where you can make new edits.
You may permanently delete previously saved experiences from within the Experience Editor by selecting theDeleteoption from the more options menu (...) in the top right column and clicking Delete permanently when prompted.
Prior to activating your Experience, ensure that the display URL is included in yourURL Allowlist for Orchestrateaccount setting.
Once you have completed the steps in the Experience Editor and saved your Experience you canActivate it from the Experience summary page. You will be directed to this page once you exit the Experience Editor.
You can import existing marketing initiatives currently managed by your channel providers, which enables you to quickly gain insights about the campaigns you’re already running. You can then take action by connecting these Experiences to your Lytics audiences.
To import an experience, click theAdd Experiencebutton in the Manage Experience page. You can select either the New or Import options in order to import experiences from our out-of-the-box integrations. Both options will direct you to the same flow.
You can monitor out-of-the-box Integration experiences and activate audiences for them within Lytics, but the management of external Experiences still happens inside your channel tools. Pausing or deleting imported Experiences in Lytics simply stops the audience syncing process. It does not pause or delete the campaign in your channel tool.
From the provided list, you will choose a provider from the list of out-of-the-box integrations. Each provider has a single tactic selection associated to it.
You will need then need to configure the experience based on that selected provider. Below you will find an overview of the steps for navigating the Experience Editor for out-of-the-box integrations. For more detailed information for specific integrations, use the links below to navigate to the the integration documentation for your selected provider:
After selecting your provider, you will be prompted to select or create an authorization to connect the integration. Existing authorizations will be shown. If you have multiple accounts within a particular channel, you will choose which account to import from.
If you don’t have an authorization, you will be prompted to add one before continuing. To create a new authorization, click theAdd new authorizationbutton, which will take you to a modal where you can enter the appropriate credentials. For provider-specific documentation on creating authorizations, see the below documentation for your selected integration.
After you have selected your Authorization you will then select the campaigns you want to import into Lytics (you may select up to 10 at a time). The total number of Experiences you can bring into Lytics is only limited by the amount in your connected provider. However, to have meaningful and accurate reporting, it's recommended to only import Experiences that will add value to the use cases you are activating within Lytics.
Completed campaigns that have already "ended", will not show on the list of importable Experiences. Those that are saved as drafts, paused, or currently running, those will be available to import.
Once you have imported an Experience, you will activate it by adding a Lytics audience. This lets you enrich your existing campaigns with Lyticsbehavioral audiences,content affinities, andDelivery Optimization.
The Target step in the Experience editor allows you to configure the target audience for your Experience. Use the dropdown to select from among your pre-built audiences. ClickNew audienceat the bottom of the dropdown menu if you need to build a new one and you will be directed to theaudience builder.
The Configure step in the Experience Editor allows you to configure how the audience for your Experience will be exported to the third-party tool you are using. In order to successfully activate and export an Experience to your provider tool, you will need to correctly configure the Experience. See below for links to the configuration documentation for each supported integration.
Delivery Optimization takes the guesswork out of deciding who to send what message, and when. For the third partyExperience providersbuilt-in to the Lytics Canvas, you can use this option to automatically determine when to deliver messages to individual users on those channels.
This step in the Experience editor allows you to toggle Delivery OptimizationOnorOff. If you do nothing, it will remain off. You can turn it on to help prevent over-messaging and let you focus on creating great Experiences, rather than manually building delivery logic rules that are complicated to manage and execute.
Lytics uses data science to determine the optimal delivery time of an Experience for individual audience members. The delivery time is based on when an audience member last interacted with your brand via the channel of the Experience, as well as their behavior when that interaction happened. Experience decisioning also uses the Experience's performance measured by click-through rate (CTR) to estimate engagement likelihood.
The actual delivery of an Experience is always controlled by the downstream tool, where there could be additional logic necessary to deliver the Experience. Lytics Delivery Optimization simply controls when the user data is triggered to send to your third-party tool.
Consider the Experience tactic when determining if you want to turn Delivery Optimization on. For Experiences using real-time delivery such asIterable triggered emails, Delivery Optimization can help improve user engagement by reaching each user at the ideal time.
In other circumstances such as sending a one-time blast email throughSendGridfor a sale promotion, you'll likely want to leave Delivery Optimization off and simply push a list of all current users into the audience so that you can send the campaign as soon as you're ready. If Delivery Optimization was enabled, you may not see users exported to SendGrid until they "need" to receive a message (the most optimal time).
When you first enter the Experience editor, you will see aSavebutton in the top right corner which allows you to save your progress at any time.
If you have made it to the final step within the Experience Editor (Configure Delivery for out-of-the-box integrations), theNext Stepbutton will now be aSave and Exitbutton. Click on this button to save and exit your Experience. If you have previously saved your Experience and made no other changes this will simply allow you to exit the Experience Editor.
After the Experience has been saved once, the button will become aSavebutton that is only enabled when you make further changes.
If you have not yet named the Experience at the time you save, you will be prompted to do so at this time, and the Experience's tactic will be suggested as a default.
When creating a new Experience within Lytics, name it including the purpose and any categorization (e.g. Drive sales: Holiday). When working with existing Experiences from your third party tools, name the imported experiences on Lytics with the same/similar names as in the external tool.
Unsaved Experiences
At any point you may discard your unsaved Experience by clicking on the Close button (X) in the top left corner of the Experience Editor and then clickingConfirmwhen asked "Are you sure you want to discard unsaved changes?"
You may also select the Delete option from the more options (...) menu in the top right corner of the Experience Editor and click Delete permanently when prompted.
Both methods will remove you from the Experience Editor without saving.
Previously Saved Experiences
If you have previously saved the Experience and have returned to make edits, you may discard all changes you've made since your last save by clicking on the Close button (X) in the top left corner of the Experience Editor (and clickingConfirmwhen prompted) or by selecting theDiscard Changesoption from the more options menu (...) in the top right column.
The former will discard changes and exit the Experience Editor. The latter method will allow you discard changes, but stay within the Experience Editor where you can make new edits.
You may permanently delete previously saved experiences from within the Experience Editor by selecting theDeleteoption from the more options menu (...) in the top right column and clicking Delete permanently when prompted.
Once you have completed the steps in the Experience Editor and saved your Experience you canActivate it from the Experience summary page. You will be directed to this page once you exit the Experience Editor.
In addition to tracking default UTM variables when users visit your website, Lytics supports two custom UTM parameters specific to tracking clicks from out-of-the-box Integration Experiences.
You may be recommended by the LyticsExperience Insightsto add UTM parameters to an Experience. The Lytics insights system will check the target URL of your eligible imported Experiences to see if it has these parameters configured and advise you on which Experiences are missing them.
For most email providers click information is collected automatically through webhooks or APIs, but for ads this is the only way of recording user attribution. Lytics highly recommends using these UTM parameters in your ad Experiences as it will not only allow you to build and target audiences of users who have converted on your ad in Lytics, but it will also inform Lytics decisioning and insights as the platform builds a better understanding of which users respond to which Experiences.
Use the following custom UTM parameters in any links coming from your external Experiences.
These variables allow us to link the website visit with a click from the Experience. Thus recording what users clicked on what Experience.
Using these UTMs will only work if the website linked from your ad has the Lytics JavaScript Tag installed.
The steps for adding these parameters may differ by provider, but generally speaking you can add them directly to the target URL of your Experience, for example:
https://www.lytics.com?utm_lytics_source=facebook&utm_lytics_experience=23847
Please refer to the providers that have specific docs on how to add these parameters:
The UTM parameter is recognized by Lytics and mapped to the user fieldConverted on Experience (URL Param)which is available in the audience builder so that you can create audiences of users who have clicked on your Experiences. The key of this map field will contain theExternal IDof your Experience and the value will be the number of times the user clicked on the ad set.

If you find that the number of users in an audience utilizing this field does not match the conversion count you are seeing on your Experience summary page, it is important to rememberthe source of these numbers is different. Usually for ad providers, metrics are aggregate numbers imported directly from the API of the ad tool. If you added the tracking URL parameter to your ad after publishing, you may see a smaller user count when utilizing the user field.
Generic Experiences allow you to export your Lytics audience to any tool you choose. Since you will not be able to monitor the performance of this Experience from Lytics, it's primary use cases are to act as a placeholder for..
Generic Experiences allow you to produce audiences with all the nested targeting rules of a Stage within a Goal to make the audience mutually exclusive of the other Stages.As such, Generic Experiences should only be used for Experiences included in a Stage of a Goal.
Unlike out-of-the-box integration Experiences, Delivery Optimization and Experience reporting is not available for Generic Experiences, so Generic Experiences should only be used for Experiences included in a Stage of a Goal.
From the provided list, you will choose a Generic as the provider. Generic Experiences only support one tactic:
The Target step in the Experience editor allows you to configure the target audience for your Experience. Use the dropdown to select from among your pre-built audiences. ClickNew audienceat the bottom of the dropdown menu if you need to build a new one and you will be directed to theaudience builder.
This step offers a quick overview of the additional steps you will need to take to activate your Audience for this Experience

Upon saving and naming you Experience, an audience will be generated.
If you are still within the Experience Editor the Tutorial screen will be updated to provide a link to the generated audience.
If you have exited the Experience Editor you can find this link by clicking the Help link in the Experience summary page.
When you first enter the Experience editor, you will see aSavebutton in the top right corner which allows you to save your progress at any time.
If you have made it to the final step within the Experience Editor (Tutorial for Generic Experiences), theNext Stepbutton will now be aSave and Exitbutton. Click on this button to save and exit your Experience. If you have previously saved your Experience and made no other changes this will simply allow you to exit the Experience Editor.
After the Experience has been saved once, the button will become aSavebutton that is only enabled when you make further changes.
If you have not yet named the Experience at the time you save, you will be prompted to do so at this time, and the Experience's tactic will be suggested as a default.

You may permanently delete previously saved experiences from within the Experience Editor by selecting theDeleteoption from the more options menu (...) in the top right column and clicking Delete permanently when prompted.
Once you have completed the steps in the Experience Editor and saved your Experience you will need to navigate to the created audience and export it to the integration of your choice.
Navigate to the created audience in the Experience summary page by clicking on Help and then the link found within theFinish setting up your Generic Experiencesection.
Export the audience from the Audience summary page.
On the Experience summary page, you will find Experience performance reporting. This reporting contains three metrics for the campaigns you’ve created or imported into Lytics. Use these metrics to establish a baseline of your campaign performance and measure growth over time.
In addition to the Experience Performance Reporting, the Lytics View feature can be enabled in your account to give you additional information about your Experiences via an Experience Intelligence Report. The Experience Intelligence Report, once enabled, will add the following modules to your Experience summary page (as well as in the Goal Intelligence Report for Experiences within Goals):
Your account must have Lytics View feature enabled in order to see this module. Reach out to your Customer Success Manager to have this feature enabled.
The Insights module displays how many Insights have been generated for your account in the last week. Lytics Experience Insights are the combination of a fact and an action. The fact is a metric about your audience or campaign data, and the action is a recommendation on how to improve engagement and conversions.
Leverage Insights while evaluating and planning your campaigns to make data-driven iterations and achieve your goals more efficiently.
SeeInsights Introductionto learn more.
The Goal Attribution module displays metrics around how conversions on your Experience relate to conversions on your Goal. The percentage compares the total number of people reached by the Experience and those who converted. ForFacebook Ads with UTM parametersincluded, Lytics will capture conversion data at the user level.
Use this metric to determine which campaigns to invest more or less in based on how they contribute toward your larger marketing Goal.
The Content Recommendation module surfaces content that is likely to resonate with your users based on their past behavior. Lytics analyzes and classifies the content on your website through the Lytics JavaScript Tag. The relevancy percentage is calculated by determining the total number of users with various content affinities and comparing this to the total number of users within the audience that visited your site.
Create and deliver more content that aligns with your users’ interests to drive engagement and conversions.
SeeContent Affinity IntroductionandContent Recommendationto learn more.
The Data Science Performance Simulator module displays “simulated” conversion rate metrics that compare how your campaign audience performed against Lytics out-of-the-box,behavioral audiences. This gives a risk-free preview of how effective your campaigns could be when leveraging behavioral scores and custom models powered by Lytics data science.
You can activate Lytics data science audiences and custom models in your campaigns by upgrading from the free trial.

Paragraphs:
Learn about Lytics' Behavioral Scores
Lytics uses data to create more data through a suite of data science techniques. The purpose is to synthesize raw, impenetrable data into something insightful that can be utilized effectively in campaigns.
This synthesis, like all data in Lytics, is applied at the user level. While aggregated analysis may be helpful for looking at trends in customer behavior, user-level analysis can be utilized for one-to-one marketing. Much like how the Lytics Content Affinity Engine allows for immediate targeting and execution using content affinity audiences, Lytics descriptive and predictive modeling allows for immediate targeting and execution using behavioral analysis.
Lytics constantly tracks events from many data sources: web, email, Salesforce, and custom sources as well. Looking at this data directly is not useful; it needs to be summarized. Lytics allows for simple summaries by means of user fields and for use in audiences, but there is more to be learned from all this behavioral data.
Behavioral analysis asks many questions and computes the answer. Questions such as:
After finding the answers to these questions, for every user, Lytics uses these answers to inform nine low-level scores that get assigned to every user who has shown enough behavior for a confident assessment.
These scores are computed automatically, they are kept up to date continuously, and they are assigned relative to other users in the account.
There is a lot to learn looking at user-level behavioral data. Lytics evaluates behavioral data automatically in real-time and reports nine scores for each user.

These scores each represent a distinct behavioral quality and can be composed to build rich audiences. Please note, users must have behavioral data to make confident measurements before they have scores. If a user was added to Lytics via email upload, for instance, they would have no scores.
Note:If you are already a customer of Lytics, you can see the following explanation of each score alongside your own data in the app on the Scoring page.
Quantitymeasures a user's cumulative activity over their lifetime of brand engagement. The more activity the user registers, the higher the score. This score measures the user relative to all other users.
It is a common tactic to target a user based on the number of times the user has visited a website or has performed some other behavior. This becomes increasingly difficult as marketers add more data sources to their stack, and the user continues to engage over time.
Quantity takes into account a user's behavior on all data sources and measures that relative to how the most and least active users are engaging — so a user's score will always be between 0 and 100. You can think of this as a test score.
What is the point of scoring between 0 and 100? This is how we can ensure that any audience created with a score will always stay relevant. Perhaps 1,000 page visits seems like a lot for a user now, but the number will only grow larger as your site grows older and the amount of content you have increases. Another benefit of having a bounded score range is the ability to see the complete distribution of all users.

This is an example of how scores look like across an entire audience. The x-axis is the score (ranging from 0 to 100; 5 to 95 in the example for clarity) and the y-axis is the number of people who have that value as their score.
Frequencymeasures how consistent a user is interacting with your brand over time. More frequent interactions means a higher score. This score measures the user relative to all other users.
This serves as a measurement of user regularity. Do they visit once a week? Once a day? Once a lifetime?
Since this score is relative to all your users, you can easily target your most frequent users, rather than something like "users who visited in the last week", which will vary wildly in size.
Again, this score has a fixed range of 0 to 100. All the scores are like this. It is how we can continuously update user profiles without having to update audience definitions.
Recencymeasures how recently the user's general interaction has been. More recent activity means a higher score. This score measures the user's recent activity relative to the user's past activity.
Without scoring, this would be achieved by looking at the last time a user visited. Although better than nothing, that approach is kind of crude. Maybe an at-risk user opened your email by accident? It'd be an expensive oversight to assume that the user had recent activity and didn't need any nurturing.
Intensitymeasures the depth of a user's typical interaction with your brand. More sustained intense/deep usage means a higher score. This score measures the user relative to all other users.
The behavior a user exhibits during a single session is very telling of them as a consumer. If they have high interaction in a session (high intensity) they are more likely to be a deeper researcher or more curious. If they have low interaction in a session (low intensity) they are more likely to be casually browsing or engaged with a certain piece of content, but not your overall brand.
Momentummeasures the rate at which users are interacting with your brand. Users who are interacting more than usual with your brand will have a higher score. This score measures the user's recent activity relative to the user's past activity.
It's easy to confuse how momentum and recency differ, but they are actually very different. Universally speaking, we've found them to have a 5% correlation. Recency measures absolute recency of activity, but just because a user has recent activity, doesn't mean they're not at risk of churning.
If a user maintains a constant rate of activity, their momentum score will be 50. If they are more active than they used to be, their momentum will be greater than 50 and might warrant a loyalty offer. If they are less active than they used to be, their momentum will be less than 50 and might warrant a win-back campaign.
Propensitypredicts how likely a user is to return with subsequent activity. Users exhibiting positive interaction patterns are more likely to return and have higher scores. This score measures the user relative to all other users.
There are many reasons why users churn — changing interests, competition from competitors, bad experience, etc. — but from a data perspective, attrition of any kind starts to look similar.
Propensity employs an ensemble of statistical models to identify any patterns it can find for detecting how and when attrition starts to occur. With time, it's able to find more patterns in your data and become increasingly accurate in identifying when users start to exhibit those behaviors.
Consistencymeasures the regularity or stability of a user's engagement pattern. Users who engage with your brand at a regular cadence will have higher scores. For example, a user that registers behavior every 7 days will have high consistency, and would have the same consistency as a user who registers behavior every 30 days. As users' behavior starts to vary — sometimes every 7 days, sometimes every 30 — the users' consistency score will decrease.
Consistency scores can be paired with propensity scores to build more accurate Lookalike Models to predict customer churn and target users with win-back programs before they bounce. Learn more about how to reduce churn using Lytics Lookalike Models.
Maturityis a normalized measure of how long a user has registered behavior. This indicates how "old" a customer is relative to your other users. A user who has registered behavior over 5 years will likely have high maturity. A user who registered behavior over 3 years, but hasn't registered any in 2 years will have less maturity. A user who registered behavior over the most recent 3 years will have the same maturity as the user previously mentioned.
As an example, you could target users with high maturity scores inviting them into a loyalty rewards program via ads, emails, and in-app notifications. You may also want to consider suppressing engaged users who are likely to make their next purchase without additional advertising. Low maturity users, on the other hand, could be served more onboarding or educational content to nurture them into high-value, long-term users.
Volatilitymeasures how stable vs. sporadic a user is interacting with your brand. It represents the stability of the volume of data that a user is generating, and serves as a slightly more nuanced version of the intensity score.
Consider a user where 100% of their daily sessions are considered "intense". Their intensity score would be 100, but the score doesn't yield any information regarding the volatility of a typical session.
Each Lytics score is accessible as a Custom Rule in the Audience Builder. They can be added to any audience definition as an intelligent filter when the size of the audience is larger than desired.
For example, when crafting an audience to be used to buy ads against, the size of the audience is critical. The size can be arbitrarily shrunk by taking 10% of the matching users, or it can be intelligently shrunk by creating a threshold with a Lytics score such as Propensity or Momentum. This way, the best fit users remain.
Interfacing with scores directly can be difficult. They are low-level building blocks that require expertise to use to their fullest. To make these scores more readily usable, Lytics offers out-of-the-box Behavioral Audiences that use scoring under-the-hood.
Lytics scores work best on behavioral data — that is, data that was generated by a user, like a web view or email open, rather than on list imports or other non-behavioral data.
Every supported 3rd party integration is already configured to include only behavioral data in user scores. By default, any custom integration is assumed to be non-behavioral. If you're using a custom integration that you want to contribute to behavioral scores, contact your account manager to update the setting.
Since using Lytics behavioral scores directly requires a level of understanding of the data science at play, Lytics also offers out-of-the-box behavioral audiences.
These audiences are essentially blends of scores that can be used alone or as a rule in a custom audience. For example, Casual Visitors describes users who come and go without showing much activity per session. The definition using Lytics scores isUsers with an intensity score less than 25. Now, instead of needing to know exactly what "intensity" means in this context, or what the significance of the number 25 is, the audience Casual Visitors can be used as a building block.

In this example audience, the Casual Visitors characteristic is being used to filter the users who have a high affinity for "Computing". Note that the number of people who have a high affinity for "Computing" is 276,046, but the number of people who have a high affinity for "Computing"andqualify as a Casual Visitor is 185,747.
Reducing the size of an audience is a great way to make a campaign more efficient. Additionally, splitting an audience based on behavioral properties is a great way to introduce different modes of communication for different archetypes of users. For instance, Casual Visitors may not stick around long enough to answer their own questions, try engaging them with a slideout on early page visits. The opposite of Casual Visitors, Deeply Engaged Visitors, are probably determined to find that information on their own and would find a popup to be annoying. Splitting the audience keeps both archetypes engaged without accidentally detering anyone.

The follow out-of-the-box audiences are prefixed with "Lytics" and can be found in the Audiences list.
Remember that each of these out-of-the-box behavioral audiences can be recreated with the audience builder using Lytics scores user fields. Mastering Lytics scores will open up the possibility of new combinations of score thresholds that result in new behavioral audiences to be used as building blocks in campaigns.

Leveraging User Profiles
Crawling: https://docs.lytics.com/docs/accessing-data-from-javascript
Paragraphs:
Once user fields have been surfaced, they can be used to personalize a user's experience. For example, a theoretical car buying site has surfaced some basic info about a user's last vehicle search results in the following data available in the browser.
Create a JavaScript function that populates form fields.
Initialize the callback handler.
Create a callback: This will execute an action via JavaScript once the visitor has been identified and the profile has been loaded (using the function outlined above).
Once the profile has loaded, Lytics will call the JavaScript function and populate the form on the site. Once all the above steps are completed, the final code is as follows:
This is one basic example of leveraging the current visitor's profile information. The personalization powered by Lytics builds from here. Using a similar pattern, you could surface new listings on the site's index page that match a user's last search or present other vehicles that user may be interested in.

Crawling: https://docs.lytics.com/docs/accessing-profiles-server-side
Paragraphs:
By default, Lytics returns a user's profile and any surfaced fields to the browser. This, however, is not always sufficient when it comes to marketing use cases. An alternative approach is to do the lookup based on the user cookie, utilizing the server side language of your choice. First, read the browser's cookies to get the visitor's_uidin order to identify them, make a request to thePersonalizationto get the visitors current profile, and then surface the profile as a JavaScript object.
Identifying the user can be done in a variety of ways. By default, Lytics sets a cookieseeridthat is used to identify a user. This is then surfaced in a user profile as_uid. The_uidfield is what the Lytics JavaScript tag uses for web based identity resolution. That said, if users are logged in or identified by another known key this can be used in place ofseeridin the following examples.
Since we already have a cookie, all we need to do is read those to get the user profile from the Lytics API.
Once you have an identifier, make a GET request to our personalization API. In this example, the cookie value is used to build a call to the personalization API for three fields:last_make,last_model,last_color. If you are using a custom key value pair for identification, replace the$fieldnameparameter with the field name of your identifier in Lytics and$valuewith the value of that key.
Next, parse the response and either inject the variables directly into your template or surface the profile as a JavaScript object.

Crawling: https://docs.lytics.com/docs/anonymous-visitors
Paragraphs:
Lytics considers anonymous visitors to be users identified only by a_uid. A_uidis a Lytics tracking value assigned to a cookie. Since cookies can be cleared, aren’t shared across browsers or computers, and aren’t strictly associated with an individual, they are unreliable. For these reasons, Lytics considers these visitors to be anonymous.
Anonymous visitors can still have rich behavioral data. Every page they visited, the number of times theyvisited, the time they visited, and behavior patterns for data science models. A User Profile is nothing morethan the set of known User Field values associated with the_uidof the Anonymous Visitor.
Since all information about anonymous visitors relies on the continued use of a cookie, it is in a marketer'sbest interest to convert these unknown users to known users. Cookies are temporary, but email addresses are not.
Note that when a user converts from anonymous to known, all information we knew about them carries with them.When their_uidbecomes associated with an email address (or any other By Field), both Profiles (the_uidprofile andthe email address profile) merge through a process called Identity Resolution.

Paragraphs:
Lets take an in-depth look at Lytics segments. We'll cover how to define a segment with SegmentQL or SegmentAST, as well as the Segment API endpoints to create, read, update, delete, scan, and list the segments in your account.
Note that throughout this guide we use the term segment and audience interchangably. Specifically, the term audience refers to a segment on the user table. In your Lytics account there is also a separate table and schema for content. A segment on this table is often called a content collection.
DifficultyBeginner
TLDR:Checkout the Segment API documentation.
Other resources:
If you haven't yet, take a minute to check out theaudience builderin your account. This can be accessed from the Audience tab in the Lytics UI and then by selecting tocreate a new audience.
The audience builder is a visual interface for what we will cover in the first section of this guide - defining a segment. A segment definition at its core is really just a conditional statement. If the data we have collected on a user meets the conditions of the segment than they are considered a member. We have two different syntaxes for these conditional segment definitions: SegmentQL, and SegmentAST.
SegmentQL is simple Query Language using filter statements. Before we dive too deep into the syntax, lets look at a segment built in the segment builder UI side by side with its SegmentQL definition.

In this examplecm_statusrefers to the subscriber status in Campaign Monitor, an email provider. So a marketer might build this audience as a target for all users who are active across their email and web channels in the last 7 days.
For us developers, this simple query language is probably quite intuitive! Our UI exists for marketers to build audiences, but you might find it quicker to write SegmentQL, and create a segment through the API. Just to cover all our bases lets take an in depth look at the anatomy of a filter statement:
SegmentAST expressions look very similar to SegmentQL but instead of having its own filter syntax it is formatted in JSON. It's perhaps less readable for a human, but if you're writing a program which creates or updates segment definitions it might be easier to format the bodies of your requests using SegmentAST. Lets look at the same example from above in SegmentAST.

Definitely not as easy to look at as SegmentQL, but if you spend a second scanning the JSON that you'll see it's generally the same expressions. Here is a breakdown of the key components:
The segment validate endpoint accepts a plain text SegmentQL statement and ensures that the definition is valid. This can be especially useful when creating a segment. Before sending a request to build the segment via the API you might want to validate it first.
Note that this endpoint does not validate field names in your account. It simply checks the syntax of the SegmentQL statement.
The segment create endpoint accepts plain text (containing SegmentQL) or a JSON body (SegmentQL or AST).
You must know the segment ID or slug name to fetch the segment via the read endpoint.
You must know the ID or the slug of the segment to update.
You must know the ID or the slug of the segment to delete.
For many of the CRUD operations we just talked about you need to know the ID or slug name of the segment. It may help to have access to a list of all existing segments in your account to use as a reference. The list endpoint will return a list of all segments for your account including id, slug, and the QL and/or AST definition of the segment.
The scan endpoint provides a list of all entities in a segment. For audiences (segments on the user table) the entities returned are user profiles. The scan endpoint can accept a number of different query parameters, we won't cover all of them here, but as always you can check outour docsfor the full details on this API.
You can use this endpoint to scan an existing, saved segment in which case you'll need the segment ID or slug. You can also scan an ad-hoc segment by passing SegmentQL to the endpoint.
If the total number of entities in the segment exceeds the limit provided in the request (the default value is 20) then we will paginate the results. In the JSON body, there will be a token value with the keynext. To get the next page of results in the scan, make a subsequent request with the query paramstartequal to thenexttoken from the prior request. The API will continue to returnnexttokens in each response until you've fully scaned the segment.
The endpoints we covered here will get you started with Lytics segments. We do have a couple segment APIs that were not covered in this guide, primarily around segment size. The API for this is quite simple, check outour docsif you're interested. It also may help to look at thecatalog schemaand/or thequeryAPI if you're unfamiliar with the fields in your Lytics account. Keep in mind that everything you see in the Lytics web UI is built off of our APIs. It is never "necessary" to use the UI to complete a task with Lytics. If you have the time and resources you can build many different custom applications to interface with your Lytics account through our APIs. We're excited to work with developers to tackle exciting new use cases. If our docs aren't enough you can alwaysreach out to us.

Paragraphs:
Learn how to add seamless content recommendations to your website fueled by Lytics' Content Affinity Engine; all it takes is an API request and a little HTML.
Difficulty:Beginner
TLDR:Here's some docs instead.
Other resources:
Before we go crazy adding recommendations to your website we should think about what kind of content we want to allow for recommendation. Lets create a dynamic set of content that will be the target pool of documents for this content recommendation block.
To do this, we can use theLytics Segment APIcreate endpoint.
In the command above, we made a POST request to create a new segment on the content table, or as we call it - a content collection. We usedSegment QLto define the filter on the content in your account. In the example above, we're only accepting urls that contain the pathfroyo/flavors. Simple enough, right? If you've used theAudience builderyou may notice that the logic for building a segment is essentially the same format.
Here's a more complex example:
You're probably wondering where these field names are coming from! These are the standard fields used in our content table. Here's a list of relevant fields you might use in building a content collection:
Also if you have access to your queries in the Data tab of the Lytics UI you can see how the raw data from thelytics_content_enrichstream is parsed.
To add inline content recommendations to your website all we have to do is draft some simple HTML. Pathfora will look for appropriately named data attributes, and replace the contents of these elements with recommendations from our APIs.
First lets look at a simple, quick example, then we'll break down what these attributes mean:
Here's a quick rundown of the relevant data attributes:
imagedata-pftype attributes will set thesrcvalue if applied to animgelement (as with the example above) or if used on adivor some other type of element it will set thebackground-imageto be the primary image from the document.
Similarly, theurldata-pftype attribute will set thehrefvalue to the url of the document if applied to anatag, but otheriwse will set the innerHTML of the element.
You may have seen a section on blogs  "If you liked this, you may also like..." with a list of three or more related articles. This is a common use case for content recommendations. We repeat the same HTML pattern to create multiple recommendations in a set, just remember to change thedata-pfblockvalue. If we have multiple recommendations using the same content collection then we will ensure that the same piece of content is not shown twice on one page.
Here's a more in depth example, with a little CSS this can be easily styled to match your website:
This exact CSS gets loaded by Pathfora, but adding it to your CSS ensures that elements are hidden as the document is loaded.
Since this is primarily a developer use case we don't provide any native reporting of inline recommendations at the moment, however it is super simple to link this up to send interaction data to Lytics or Google Analytics. Check out ourLytics Javascript Tag documentationfor more.
If you'd like a "pre-baked" version of inline recommendations, we also have a version that's built from our personalize modules. You can find the documentation for thishere.

Data Collection & Onboarding
Crawling: https://docs.lytics.com/docs/custom-data-ingestion
Paragraphs:
Lytics can onboard and process data from custom data sources, helping to build out furtherUser Profileswith data specific to your company. Custom data is often the most valuable for your marketing efforts as itallows you to personalize web experiences and build meaningful audiences using data unique to your users.
Unlike data collected from web activity and integrated marketing tools which automatically map data to Lytics user fields, custom data sources require an evaluation, planning, and implementation process. The Lytics team will assist in identifying use cases and the data fields needed to achieve them. Our CE team will then produce a data dictionary that describes the structure, format, location and relationship of your data. The data dictionary is used to writequerieswhich map custom data fields to Lytics user fields as it is ingested. Finally your custom data is uploaded to the Lytics and made available for use to build audiences, personalize web experiences, or export to marketing tools.
Data can be uploaded to Lytics via CSV SFTP upload or ourcollection APIs. Lytics can ingest both large, bulk uploads of user data and smaller, real-time uploads of event data. Before uploading data to Lytics, ensure all necessary LQL queries are in place or it will not be mapped to Lytics user fields, preventing identity resolution. When considering large uploads to the Lytics platform, be aware that this may cause an event backlog on your account. This occurs as our platform queues incoming information as it processes the content of the upload. Processing begins when the upload completes and can last considerably longer than the initial upload. This can result in a delay in seeing information from other sources in your account as well as delays in any outbound, trigger-based workflows.
Getting your custom data ready to be properly ingested is crucial during your onboarding process with Lytics. This document gives an overview of the formatting requirements for custom data sources sent to Lytics via batch CSV or JSON, utilizingS3orSFTPimport workflows, as well as batch or real-time imports using ourcollection APIs.
When you have a recurring bulk import, fromS3orSFTPfor example, you must consistently follow naming conventions to ensure your data is ingested and displayed correctly.
If needed, files may be compressed using the zip format prior to ingestion. The zip file will be decompressed and deleted after the content has been ingestied.
For more, reference thebasic rulesfor CSV files.
Lytics is able to ingest data in a different order than the events described in that data transpired. For this to work, individual JSON or CSV records must have a timestamp associated with them. For workflow-based imports, select the key/column which contains the event timestamp when import workflows are configured. For Collection API imports, use the timestamp field URL parameter.
All imports require the following format:YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:S. If an explicit timestamp is not specified, the data will be timestamped by Lytics upon ingestion.
When Lytics looks for new files, it will choose first based on the file'slast modified date. If multiple files have the same last modified date, the date stamp in the file name is used to select the next file to import.
JSON file formatting varies slightly depending on the method and nature of the data to import. See examples for bulk and real-time imports below.
Files imported via S3, SFTP, or bulk collection should benewline delimited, meaning each object represents a single record/event, and there is a newline separating them.
Files sent to collection should be formatted as regular JSON, where each record/event is an object in an array of objects:
Lytics has a limited ability to parse nested data. Objects may contain other objects and arrays, but objects may not contain nested arrays of objects therein.

Paragraphs:
Lytics provides two ways to onboard data from your website, email marketing, and online advertising. The Lytics JavaScript tag, once installed on your website, will send user activity data. The Lytics pixel can be embedded in email or ads and configured to send user data back to Lytics on load.
The Lytics JavaScript tag sends page views and any custom events you have configured to thedefaultstream (unless configured otherwise). This event data will be translated into user fields in the Lytics schema with predefined or custom mappings. For example, the following request would send a user's email address, first name, and last name to Lytics:
Our tag can be installed manually or with a tag manager such as Google Tag Manager. If the Lytics JavaScript tag is installed using a tag manager, thejstag.sendcommand may not be the correct function to call.
When the Lytics JavaScript tag cannot be installed, the Lytics Image Pixel can be used to onboard user data from any source that allows an image to be loaded, such as email and online ads.
There are three key variables that need to be defined when sending information to Lytics using the Lytics Image Pixel. The account ID, the name of the receiving data stream, and the event data in the form of query parameters. For example, this pixel will send the user’s email address and Google Universal Tag Manager (UTM) medium and source variables to thedefaultstream of account24546133b65465413w9.
This image tag can be inserted into any HTML document including advertisements and emails and will send the event data on load.
Lytics does not have a fixed schema, any key-value pair can be passed using the JavaScript tag or pixel. However, only data which has been mapped to user fields will be available for use in audiences. Out of the box, the Lytics JavaScript Tag and Image Pixel have the ability to onboard the following information when using the default data stream:
Events regarding specific user actions such as a CTA click can also be sent to Lytics. In addition to any of the parameters identified above you can append event specific data to the send request resulting in a few more fields on the profile:
Google UTM campaign parameters are automatically pulled in and added to profiles as well. For more details on Google UTM parameters and how to use them visit theGoogle help docs. The following fields will be added to the profile when UTM parameters are received:
In order to collect data entered on a form, you will need to use jstag.send() when a user submits that form. The fields below will be available as user fields if the form name is sent asform_name, and any fields in the form need to start withformdata_, for exampleformdata_country.
As a convenience, a standard conversion event has been defined in order to surface some useful conversion related aggregates such as most recent conversion value or the oldest conversion time. When passing conversion events, the event name must be "conversion" for the following mapping to occur:

Paragraphs:
The following tutorial provides step-by-step guidance for setting up, configuring, and testing data collection from a mobile device in real-time using Firebase Analytics (FA) & Google Tag Manager (GTM). This is an excellent alternative for minimizing the number of SDKs that must be deployed from your mobile app by leveraging a robust and well-tested analytics solution in Firebase Analytics using GA4.
In this tutorial, we’ll cover the following steps:
This solution leveragesFirebase Analyticswhich Google Analytics powers under the hood. This means that in addition to getting data delivered to Lytics, you’ll also be able to leverage Google Analytics and its direct integrations to other Google products such as BigQuery as an automatic value add.
Google providesthorough documentationfor getting a Firebase project set up and installed in your platform of choice.
Once you have completed the setup and made it to theStart logging eventssection of the documentation, you are ready to move to the next step. Feel free to log some sample events per the documentation, either way, we’ll come back here further down in this tutorial.
Next, we’ll leverage Google Tag Manager, which offers seamless integration with Firebase Analytics to forward events collected by Firebase to Lytics. Like Firebase, Google hasexcellent documentationfor getting a Google Tag Manager account set up and the iOS or Android SDKs configured.
Now that we have configured Firebase and Google Tag Manager, we are ready to start configuring and sending our events. Firebase makes both setting user properties as well as passing interaction-based events easy. For more details on the power of Firebase, you can revisit theStart Logging Eventssection of the getting started documentation.
The above represents an example of a custom event nameddid_something. For that event, we also include two parameters_uidandlytics_test_key. These parameters are entirely up to you and should be in support of your use case. Keep a record of the parameters used, as you will need to explicitly define those in Google Tag Manager to pass them to Lytics.
That said, including an identifier of some for every event is essential to your identity resolution strategy. In the above example, we use_uid, which is one of the default identifiers. Consult your account manager or solutions team for the optimal approach here. Regardless of the approach, it is essential that the ID(s) passed persist. There are various ways to generate and store a value on the device. For this step, it is best to consult your app development team.
One example would be to use Swift'sUUIDto generate a unique user identifier and store it usingUserDefaults. The method used to generate, store, and access this value has no impact on the results. It is only essential to include that value in all events and have it persist for as long as possible. On that note, whenever possible, it is a best practice to include multiple identifiers such as email, or IDFA, to maximize the match rate.
The final step in getting user details from your app to Lytics is configuring your Google Tag Manager Container. We’ll start by definingVariablesfor each of the parameters you pass in your events from your app. Based on our example, we’ll define two variables: _uid and lytics_test_key.
From the Google Tag Manager dashboard, navigate toVariablesin the left-hand menu.
Create a new variable, one for each parameter, using theNewbutton. In the new window that loads, clickChoose a variabletype and selectEvent Parameter. This is just an example, you can use any variable type based on your needs.Event Namemay also prove helpful in adding more context to the event data delivered to Lytics.
Finish your variable configuration by selectingCustom Parameter, followed by inputting one of the parameter names we defined above. In our case, we’ll use_uidwith a default value of an empty string. Save your settings and move to the next parameter until you have created a variable for all parameters being passed to Lytics.
With your variables defined, we’ll move on to creating a newTagwithin our container. SelectTagsfrom the left-hand menu andNewtag once the list of tags has loaded. On the following window, clickChoose a tag typeand selectCustom Image.
With your tag type selected, we’ll configure theImage URLas well as theTriggeringrules. The Image URL will leverage theLytics Image Pixelcollection method. To configure, you’ll need to know yourAccount ID.
For simplicity, we’ll break the full URL into two parts that will be joined together in actual execution.
Focusing first on the path, everything fromhttpsup to the?you will need to replace theYOUR-AIDportion of the path with your actualaccount IDand theSTREAMportion of the path to your desired ingest stream.
The query parameters will contain the field name you’d like to pass to Lytics, as well as a value that is populated by referencing the GTM variables.
Putting those two parts together results in the final value of theImage URLin our config.
Last we’ll configure the event that triggers our forward by selectingAll Events.
With our tag defined, the final step is publishing the Google Tag Manager container and storing the config that is generated in the proper directory of our App. Once again,Google provides instructionsfor doing so.
With our implementation all configured, the final step is to test and debug. Each of the steps defined above supports testing and debugging. We’ve added quick links to those resources below.

Data Management
Crawling: https://docs.lytics.com/docs/stitching-user-profiles
Paragraphs:
This guide gives context on Lytics user profiles and helps illustrate the most common ways to combine orstitchprofiles based on shared identifiers. While it is geared for marketers, you will likely need a developer on your team to implement some of these tactics.
“How do I know that an anonymous user browsing my website is the same user that just opened my email?”
“How can I make sure I am not over-marketing to the same user because I can’t tell who they are across all my data sources and tools?”
“How do I achieve 1:1 personalization without a single source of truth for my users?”
Lytics aims to solve these problems by creating a holistic customer view through data unification. Lytics is based on user profiles - meaning any and all data ingested needs to be tied to a user. A user profile is generated and defined by anidentifier:
Foranonymous users, this identifier can be the Lytics cookie placed after you install the Lytics JavaScript tag.
Forknown users, this is most commonly an email, but can also be various forms of user IDs across your data sources.
Richer profiles that include attributes from various data sources allow marketers to run their campaigns more efficiently, resulting in better targeting and remarketing, personalization, cost per action (CPA), among other results. Therefore, profile stitching early on in your journey with Lytics will be important and impactful for your success with the platform.
But how does Lytics actually stitch your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) users, to your web browsers, to your email subscribers? The answer is through common identifiers shared between tools.
A common identifier is used by Lytics to create a user profile, but it’s one that also exists in another source. Some examples include:
User 1: Imported from email toolIdentifier: email address ([email protected])
User 2: Imported from CRMIdentifier: email address ([email protected]), user ID (0101010)
User 3: Imported from data warehouseIdentifier: user ID (0101010)
All of these users will merge into one profile in Lytics because they share identifiers. This will happen automatically as soon as these data points are imported. The import is themerge event.
But how would you merge an anonymous profile that ONLY has a cookie ID with a profile that has a known identifier like email? This is one of the most common use cases for Lytics users, and one that will set you up for success.
To do this, you’ll need to identify or create potential merge events. Again, more details can be found in the Profiles and Identity Resolution document, but here we’ll provide examples of common scenarios that you may consider when planning your strategy.
You can build Email Capture Modal Experiences directly in Lytics that prompt users to sign up for an e-newsletter, or receive a coupon, for example. As soon as a user fills in their email, Lytics will tie the anonymous cookie profile to the email they submitted.
If their email was already in our system under a different profile, Lytics will merge the two profiles into one. For information on building email capture Experiences, see the Experience Editor documentation.
Any of your website forms where a user submits an email are great places to create a merge event of a Lytics cookie to email. By using thejstag.send()event or setting up a Google Tag Manager Trigger, Lytics can attach an email to an anonymous profile. Some types of commonly used forms include:
Note that you can submit other data using this method. For example, if users fill in their name, profession, address, etc. in the form, you can send this as well and Lytics will append it to their profile.
Tip: You can also send Lytics a form name and timestamp using this method, which could be helpful if you’d like to retarget people who submitted certain forms, during a certain time period.
Keep in mind this will only work for forms living on your website. For forms populated in an iframe or hosted in a different way, you may need to use the Lytics pixel or an API call to capture this information.
See the documentSending Data to Lyticsfor more information on using the JavaScript tag and other methods.
Many email service providers (ESPs) have a unique user ID within their system, separate from email. It's encouraged to pass this identifier, hashed email, or any other non-PII identifier as a query string parameter within links you include in any email communication. If you are familiar with UTM parameters, this is similar.
Once you set this up in your ESP, Lytics can associate this additional identifier as another merge rule. So moving forward, whenever a user clicks on an email link that drives them to your website with the Lytics tag, Lytics will be able to stitch the email to a cookie.
Examples:
Next, you can create an audience in Lytics to track the growth of profiles that have stitched a cookie to an email. An example of what this could look like in the Lytics audience builder is shown below:
On the Audience Summary page, you can view how your audience of unknown to known users has grown over time.

Paragraphs:
TL;DR:Many things you liked about LQL are still here, and many things you didn't like are out.  Migrating your schema management to Lytics' Schema API within Conductor can simplify your workflows.
Lytics' profile pipeline processes your customer data in real-time to perform data cleansing, data transformation, data deduplication, and identity resolution.
Historically, these functions were performed in an expressive SQL-like scripting language calledLQL.  After listening to how our customers used LQL and the operational scaffolding they developed to ensure reliability while enabling process scalability, we introduced a new Schema API. Conductor provides a UI-based flow for interacting with Schema AP.
Longtime Lytics users who are comfortable with LQL have appreciated:
Longtime Lytics users who were uncomfortable with LQL didn't appreciate:
Lytics' newSchemaAPI allows you to use LQL expressions within a JSON framework with native version control.
An LQL statement combines features of datadefinitionand datamanipulation.  In the Schema API, data definition is expressed through fields, and data manipulation is expressed through mappings.

Imagine we had the following simple LQL Select statement processing data from a "purchases" data stream.  This statement is designed to accumulate the total amount that a customer has been refunded over their lifetime.
Instead of providing these definitions and transformations in a single statement, we would first create the fields into which we would like to direct this data.  The definitions for theemailandrefundedfields would look like the following.
Once we've defined the fields, we would define the mappings for both, which would look like the following.
After creating fields and mappings for the desired schema changes, simply publish your changes to see their effect immediately in your data processing.
Getting started is simple.  All of your queries have been automatically translated into appropriate fields and mapping objects.
It is recommended to immediately publish your default schemabeforemaking any changes to it.  After it has been published, any changes can be published in batches to ensure better visibility on what changes go out.
While you're not required to immediately start using Lytics' new Schema API, the classic Query API will be deprecated starting February 1, 2024

Paragraphs:
Let's take an in-depth look at Lytics Query Language (LQL) and custom data imports. We'll cover a basic overview of LQL itself, how data identities are resolved across streams, how you can map custom data and finally a few of the different ways to import custom data into your account.
Difficulty: Intermediate
TLDR:Checkout thedata upload documentationand thequery documentation.
Due to the intermediate nature of this course it is important that you already possess a strong understanding of segmentation, user fields and data streams. For those new to the Lytics data pipeline we recommend reviewing the following documentation before proceeding with the rest of the steps:
When the Lytics JavaScript tag is installed we will automatically begin collecting standard data. This includes page-view level information such as URL, browser, Lytics Cookie Id, etc. In addition to the standard page-view event the Lytics tag empowers marketers to push more sophisticated data related to the end user's behavior or identity.
An example of such data to a custom stream calledcustom_datamight look something like:
While visiting your site that has the Lytics JavaScript tag installed you can leverage Chrome's developer tools, specifically the console, to manually fire this "send" request and pass the payload above to Lytics. Keep in mind, all data sent from your browser will automatically be associated with your current cookie. When testing and playing it is best practice to always use a fresh incognito browser. Chrome tools has greatdocumentationif they are new to you as well.
Check out our JavaScript tagdata collection docsfor more details on the power of the Lytics tag.
Lytics Query Language(LQL) is the transformation layer that makes passing arbitrary, non-schema specific data to Lytics. For the most basic implementations it is simply the translation of raw event data to user field data, the Lytics schema. In more advanced implementations complex calculations can be performed on events across streams to create sums, maps, and more. An example might be rolling allpurchase_totalvalues for individual conversions into apurchase_total_over_timefield that holds the total revenue for that particular profile.
LQL is very powerful and we recommend working directly with our services team to get the most out of it. We also have some greatdocsto give you some more detail on the pre-built power.
As mentioned in our documentation, LQL can be broken down into 6 key components:
Select data to be added to user profiles. Including Maps, Counts, and other complex data types. As an example from the above event we sent from the browser you might mapstatusto the custom fieldcurrent_statusin order to unify data across streams. In that case your select statement would be something like:
wherestatusis the key name from the event stream andcurrent_statusis the field name that is used across multiple streams. TheSHORTDESCallows you to add more context around that particular field in order to simplify working with the data inside the Lytics admin.
The stream to select from. In our example case this would simply be:
This is USER for all user profiles. (technically you could create other types, such as “account”).
Filters out entire records to not be included/analyzed. Bots, Employees, Test data. In our example we might want to exclude anyone not from Winterfell.
What field are we going to identify this entity by. This is among the most important aspects of LQL. This defines which fields can be used as keys to merge data fragments together into a user profile. For instance:
Means that anytime an email address or userid matches, regardless of its origin, we can assume that is the same user, thus merging all data associated with that key.
The alias is primarily an internal value of how to reference this particular LQL statement. When accessing LQL through the UI it would be referenced by this alias:
Now that we know the basics of LQL we can put it all together in such a way that our sample data sent can be mapped into user fields. Though this can be totally customized to your liking the end product might look something like:
All that is left once we have completed writing is to save our LQL file. This file name is completely up to you but should end with.lql. This will simplify the next step when we test our LQL before uploading it to our account.
Now that we have our LQL saved locally using the.lqlextension we are ready to test. To test we will use the Lytics CLI tool. The CLI tool and installation instructions can be found onGithub.
Once we have installed the CLI tool lets verify it is working properly. In the terminal of your choice run the following command(s):
If you are presented with a help menu you are good to go, if an error comes back or something was not found we recommend going through the CLI tools docs again to get it properly configured.
The Lytics CLI can test LQL in two ways. First, it will read some of the recent events from the target stream and show you the processed output. This is valuable when it comes to altering existing LQL but may present challenges when you are writing net new LQL on data that has not been sent to Lytics yet. For that use case we'll generate a CSV file to read from locally. In addition, though not demonstrated here, Lytics watch can also use a JSON file locally in addition to the CSV.
CSV's can be created using a variety of tools. When creating your own CSV from scratch just ensure that the first row in the CSV is used to define your field keys(headers) and then each following row represents an individual user's data.
When saving your CSV ensure the file name matches that of your lql with.csvin place of.lql. For instance if your LQL file is namedmy_sample_file.lqlyour CSV should be namedmy_sample_file.csvand be located in the same directory. The Lytics CLI will look for CSVs with the same file name as your LQL file.
Lytics watch will listen for changes to your LQL file. When that happens it will take the CSV or recent data from your stream and process it using that newly altered LQL. This translation is then output into your terminal in order to validate that all mappings are working properly.
NOTE:Please be sure you are using the correct API token when performing the next operation. To check which API you currently have set simply run the following in your terminal:
The value output should match the API token pulled from your account. If this is not the case please revisit the prerequisites section above for setting up you API token.
To upload the query you will make a simple POST request to our API. Upon a successful upload you will get a response of200. Lytics handles everything else from there.
Finally we can import our CSV using a standard cURL command. Be sure to update your file and stream name in the example below:
We've covered a basic example of getting custom data into Lytics. This is very much just the beginning of how LQL can help improve your marketing teams efficiency. We invite you to explore all of our technical docs and reach out to our services team for more in-depth training on LQL and data management!

Paragraphs:
Customer acquisition is a core focus for all marketing departments.  Traditionally, B2C marketers have relied upon specialist teams and agencies to drive strategy and spend money on ad placements. However, these teams often do not have access to key customer data, and thus have to rely upon third-party data and contextual guesswork.  Additionally, these teams and agencies typically do not have access to personalize the customer experience on site.
There is a better way. First-party data can be extremely valuable for ad targeting on certain networks, and marketers with the right tools can personalize their landing page experiences.
The following is the Lytics Playbook for acquiring new customers.
There are two important concepts within acquisition marketing as it pertains to Lytics:
Lytics helps marketers to drive quality traffic by unleashing streams of powerful first-party data to ad platforms such as Google, Facebook, and Yahoo, which can leverage that data for building lookalike audiences.
How effective is this?  Most companies see their return on ad spend (ROAS) of campaigns on these platforms improve by 10-80%. 30-40% improvements are typical.
Using your first-party data, Lytics helps to improve the retargeting of your past visitors in two main ways: by identifying theirAffinities, and calculatingBehavioral Scoresof who is most likely to return.
You can then use Lytics to target personalized experiences on site to encourage the right visitors to sign up for your lists. Finally, Lytics can help to identify the subscribers and visitors who could/should be targeted with offers and content to drive a first purchase.
Why would you want to throw valuable acquisition dollars on a wasteful audience of existing customers? The answer, you don’t. But your teams are probably doing this today (almost everyone is) because they don’t have a good source for this audience.  With Lytics, you can send all customers to Facebook, Google, Verizon (Yahoo) and other platforms for suppression from lead generating advertising.
Building the audience
The key to building the right audience is to include all the customers and/or free subscribers you don't want to spend money on. If you are new to using Lytics, see ourAudiences documentationto get started. The following examples skip the first few steps and jump right into building custom audiences.
For most companies, an audience to suppress would resemble something like this:
Be sure to suppress active users on all your lists and products. This will give the most comprehensive set of customers to limit from targeting.
Export a continuously updated file
Export these audiences to the key ad platforms:Google Ads,Facebookand,Yahoo Ads.
Build suppression in your ad campaigns
And then create suppression lists in your ad campaigns. See the respective help docs for more information onFacebookorGoogle Ads.
If you’re using lookalikes of your customer file as a targeting audience, it’s likely already the best performing audience in your ad campaigns.  Have you heard of thePareto principleor the 80/20 Rule?  80% of your revenue comes from 20% of your customers.  For most companies, it’s more like 90/10.
If you can build lookalikes off your absolute best customers, you’ll help Google, Facebook, and Verizon Media to identify the absolute best audiences for your advertising.
Building the audience
In order to help train the big ad platforms as to who your best users are, send the audience over that most resembles your goal audience.  For many companies, this is likely to be people with a high lifetime value (LTV) or multiple purchases.  For example, your audiences might look like this:

Note that there are several ways to determine high LTV, so feel free to customize to your specific requirements.  The important concept is that you should be targeting lookalikes of your best customers, not lookalikes of all customers.
Export a continuously updated file
Export these audiences to the key ad platforms:Google Ads,Facebookand,Yahoo Ads.
Build lookalikes in your campaigns
Build a lookalike inFacebookor a “similar audience” (lookalike) inGoogle Ads.
The next step is to route audiences to the most impactful remarketing campaigns.  For example, you may have certain creative stored in Google and Facebook that better address one content affinity over another.  Additionally, you probably want to consider engagement-based suppressions for remarketing over carpet bombing all of your site visitors.
Building the audience
Think through which content affinities best align to your creatives. For example, break out your core audiences based on content affinity.  At Lytics, our customers tend to look like the following:

...or the user might belong to this group:

You can and should use “Any Affinity” to start.  You’ll note that users with any affinity for a topic show above-average interest in that affinity.  To narrow your focus, you might try limiting to “High Affinity.”
Also, be thinking about the likelihood of a user to re-engage.  Typically, your time window of attention is very short.  Consider filtering for users with highRecency.Descriptive & Predictive Modelingof interactions may also play a role.  Your audience might look something like the following:
Exporting the audience
Anonymous audiences are continuously exported from the LyticsJavaScript TagtoFacebookandGoogle Analyticstags.
Continue with step-by-step instructions topromote relevant content to users based on their interests.
As we mentioned at the start of this playbook, acquisition marketers seldom have the ability to personalize web landing page experiences.  With Lytics, they can.  The next step in upping your acquisition marketing game is to extend the lead generating efforts to your site with targeted email collection.
Building the audience
Don’t taint the user experience with untargeted email collection.  For known users, suppress your email collection experiences:
Building email collection campaigns
See theExperience editor docfor how to set up this type of campaign in Lytics. ThePathfora SDKallows easy customization of the look and feel such as the example below.
Continue with step-by-step instructions on how togrow your email marketing list.
Many prospective customers will need an additional nudge to make a first purchase.  The big advantage of using Lytics is the ability to target an offer consistently between site, email, and ads.  This consistent approach between channels frequently provides up to a 10% lift in conversion rates.
Building the audience
Your audience can be limited to non-customers for special incentives, and may include engagement filters or price sensitivity (e.g. if you’re trying to sell to a known cheapskate). This is a common starting audience:

As a final note, keep in mind there are many other areas to cover including copy choices, optimizations, and common pitfalls to avoid. These are beyond the scope of this playbook, but should be taken into consideration while developing your marketing strategy to acquire new customers.

Paragraphs:
Today's most popular ad platforms, such as Google and Facebook, care a great deal about the overall user experience from the time they are shown an ad through their consumption of the landing page or associated content. It is imperative that both the content and overall experience be considered when attempting to get the highest return from these platforms.
Personalized modals are no exception to this rule. In fact, when not approached strategically, modals may negatively impact both conversion rates as well as overall impressions. In the simplest of terms, an auction occurs to determine which ad(s) are served to any given user. Ads with bad experiences are penalized by either requiring a higher cost to serve or being eliminated entirely from the candidate pool to make room for ads with more potential.
There is, however, a silver lining. Gone are the days of blanket marketing initiatives which force an experience that may be optimal for the few while sacrificing the experience of the many. With Lytics, you gain an understanding of each individual's past behavior or lack thereof in real-time. This knowledge can and should be leveraged to deliver an experience that is relevant, personalized and positive. Which in turn is the best way to get the highest return from your ad and search initiatives.
The topic of ad and landing page optimization is broad. We simply could not cover all important aspects here. Rather, we've pulled together a handful of important considerations to keep in mind as you develop your marketing and personalization strategies. In addition, some may find the following content useful when attempting to triage a recent decline in impressions or other anomalies in performance.
Though it may be obvious, considering who you're targeting with modals is extremely important and often overlooked. Put yourselves in the visitor's shoes. If, for example, you are visiting a site for the very first time, it is unlikely your experience will be positive if the vast majority of the site that you are visiting is covered with a giant offer modal as soon as the page loads.
Example of full page takeover on the second click of a user's first visit before they had a chance to explore the brand.
Example of half page takeover on user's first visit.
Added for comedic value. First page view popup on article talking about discussion one of Google's many announcements to penalize such experiences.
Because Lytics allows you to target users based onprofile details, audience membership and behavior in real-time, perhaps you take a more subtle approach for new customers while being a bit more bold with visitors showing strong signs of conversion or history with your brand.
It is all too common on the web today to see companies take a "spray and pray" marketing approach where all visitors get blasted by intrusive data collection or offer modals at the beginning of their experience. This is seen as a negative for nearly all search and ad providers, many of which addressed this particular topic publicly.
To build onTargeting, there may be cases where delivering a message at the beginning of a visit is important and actually improves the experience. Consider the size and position of where that message is delivered. Does it cover prime real estate requiring the user to alter their patterns in order to see the content they want? Does it leverage a small slide-out and offer a more efficient path to value while not restricting consumption? There is no silver bullet here but testing various applications to determine the right balance can yield great results.
The device being used is often not considered when attempting to locate the root cause of a negative change. Keep in mind that modals and the site experience in general can be drastically different from device to device. A modal that is not intrusive on desktop may cover the entire canvas on mobile. Be sure to leverage your analytics tools to determine what devices are suffering from a drop off. Follow up by altering the targeting and presentation based on device or consider shutting web personalization modals off entirely in the case of mobile.
Example of cookie acceptance modal on desktop - small and not disruptive.
Example of cookie acceptance modal on mobile - much larger and more disruptive.
As we mentioned in our first example where the visitor received an offer immediately upon their first page view, one thing to consider and test is when a modal is shown. Lytics offers a variety ofdisplay optionswhich allow you to only show the modal after a set amount of seconds, after some amount of scrolling, etc. All of these levers can ensure a message is delivered after a visitor has made a connection and consumed enough content in order to make the modal experience positive.
The Lyticsweb personalization SDKis one method for delivering personalized communications on site. It was designed to offer a light lift and quick time to value but may not meet the needs of every use case. As such, theLytics JavaScript tagand variousPersonalizationAPIs can be leveraged in more custom applications to offer hyper targeting and personalized content in virtually any situation.
At the end of the day, the user experience is everything and this should be a core focus of all marketing applications when looking to get the most out of ad and search related tools.

Paragraphs:
Converting a user from unknown to known is a key part of many marketing journeys. You can use Lyticsweb Experiencesto capture user information. While email is a great starting point, you may want to collect a bit more information from your user when they subscribe to your brand.
In this guide, you will learn how to create a widget with a custom form component. The example will offer users to subscribe to an newsletter email, and will include an email input field as well as list of checkboxes that can be used to select which topics to subscribe to.

You can download the complete JavaScript configuration, CSS, andAPI overridecommand for this example from theGithub examples repository.
Currently in the Lytics UI, you may only choose to include the following fields in your capture leads form:
However, with the Pathfora SDK, or using API overrides, you can include any custom field of the following types:
Begin with a configuration for aform widget. Without defining any field customizations, Pathfora will default to using legacy form elements. However, you will be usingcustom form elementsin this guide.
This config will generate a simple slideout with a form containing some default fields.

Once you have an idea of what form elements you want to include in your widget, you may use theform builder drag and drop UIprovided in the Pathfora documentation to construct the form you wish to display. Each field can be marked as required and may have a label and name (used for as the primary key for tracking the field in Lytics and other external systems). Text fields may also include placeholder text, and for fields with multiple options you may define the display text and value of each option.

Once you clickSave, the builder will output theformElementsfield that you can simply copy and paste into your widget config. This UI is intended to help you save time when constructing configurations with custom forms.

You may style the form usingcustom CSS. The example in this guide applies some small CSS changes to adjust the size and spacing of elements within the widget.
Remember you candownload the code for this exampleto get the complete JavaScript, CSS, and API override. This can act as a starting point for your own custom form widget

Once you've tested and are happy with the look and feel of your form slideout, it's time for the most important step: defining the Lytics audience that should receive this experience.
The example widget in this guide will be targeted at an audience of anonymous users with ahigh intensity. Remember toupdate your config with the audience slugyou wish to serve the widget to.
Alternatively, you may build your widget as aweb personalize Experiencewith theCapture Leadstactic in the Lytics UI and apply theformElementssetting with an API override.

Paragraphs:
Running a complex nurture program can be difficult to manage, especially if you're using countless static email templates. Luckily most email service providers (ESPs) offer a templating language to allow for dynamic user data to be embedded in an email. Dynamic templates are not only useful for transactional emails, but you can build them to use valuable Lytics user data such as audience membership and other user profile fields to simplify your email marketing programs all while personalizing the emails to increase user engagement.
This guide will walk through how to modularize major components of an email based on Lytics audience membership using Lytics and a singleCampaign Monitortemplate. This technique is applicable to most ESPs that Lytics integrates with, just be sure to refer to the your ESP's documentation for dynamic templating.

You should have a generic HTML email template set up in your ESP. This guide uses an email template promoting new products of a shoes retailer and personalizes it based on the types of shoes the user is interested in. Think about what parts of the email you would like to change based on audience membership.
In Lytics you'll need a target audience - the group of users to send the email to - and one or more additional audiences that the email can be personalized for. In this guide we havePromotional Listas the target audience, and two audiences built withcontent affinity,Interested in Dress ShoesandInterested in Athletic Shoeswhich we will build out separate content pieces for.

Once you have your audiences ready, you will sync your target audience to an ESP. This can be done with a Lytics export integration. In this guide we willexport to Campaign Monitor. If you're using another ESP browse our list ofintegrationsand the read the instructions for exporting an audience.
SelectPromotional Listas the target audience to sync. For Campaign Monitor the other two audiences will be recorded in a custom field calledLyticsAudiences. This is the field we will use in the template to determine what to show and hide for the user.

Regardless of the provider you choose you should see the Lytics users in your email tool not long after you click theStart Exportbutton.
In this example the header of the email will change based on audience membership. For every element we want to personalize we need to have three versions of the content:
If a user is interested in both dress shoes and athletic shoes we can prioritize which to show based on the order of the conditionals we will set up in the template. We will opt to promote dress shoes in this example for that case.

Follow these steps to personalize your email template in this manor:
Open your template in an HTML editor, locate the text, image or HTML element you want to change based on audience membership.
Use the customLyticsAudiencefield and conditional logic to bind your HTML content in if/else statements. Take a look at the following example, which the example template uses to change the text on the banner of the example email:
Continue to edit your template to modularize the content of your email. In our example, we also switch out the image in the banner as well as the CTA link and text based on audience membership:
In the next step you will be able to see the rendering of the templates in each of the three contexts.
Create a new campaign in Campaign Monitor. On theContentstep upload the HTML template you've created that includes your conditionals. After you've successfully uploaded, you can preview the email and toggle between theLyticsAudiencedynamic content options to view each of the expected outputs.

On theRecipientsstep be sure to select the audience you exported to Campaign Monitor from Lytics.

Continue on to theDeliverystep. You can send a test email to yourself and/or schedule your campaign for delivery.
This guide has demonstrated how you can send three distinct, personalized emails to users based on their interests in a single campaign. Instead of sending a generic email to all your customers, you can send an email that speaks to a user's interests.
This is just the tip of iceberg, think of how you can personalize and modularize your email templates for more advanced use cases. Conditionals can be used for any number of audiences, and you can show and hide entire content sections in an email based on audience membership. Your Lytics representative can help!

Paragraphs:
A well designed Experience can really capture a user's attention, and often images are a key component to design. Lytics web Experience allow for a single image to be included, but out of the box there is not much flexibility - that's where custom CSS can help.
In this guide, you will learn how to create a widget with a stylized image component. Images are anatively supported featureof the Pathfora SDK andLytics web Experiences, however the default styles for images are rigid. This guide will explore a few different methods on how to customize images for your web Experiences.

You can download the complete JavaScript configuration and CSS, for this example from theGitHub examples repository.
There are three ways you might approach adding an image to a web Experience or Pathfora widget:
This guide will discuss the implementation of options 2 and 3. Note that option 3 is only available for widgets built directly through the SDK. Inlineimgelements can not be added in theLytics Experience editor.
To use the native image capability in Pathfora, simply add thevariantandimagesettings to a basic widget configuration to get started.
This config will generate a simple slideout, with a headline, message and CTA, and a small, circular image above the text.

Adding an image in this way is natively supported for web Experiences in thedesign stepof the editor.
You could also present an image within the text content of the widget by adding animgHTML element in the headline or message of the widget:
You may want to add a custom class name to this element to help style it with CSS later.
Note:As mentioned above using HTML inline images in this manor is not compatible withweb Experiencescreated through the Lytics UI, not even withAPI overrides. This approach only works if you are implementing widgets with the SDK directly.
The complete code example in this guide will contain both a large feature image using the native Pathfora setting, and a small inline image.

With some additional CSS work, you can style images of both types to fit the slideout.
The image generated by theimagesetting in the config has the class namepf-widget-img. In the CSS, to select this element you will also need an additional level of specificity to ensure that your styles will override the default Pathfora styles for images. The example below specifies thepf-widget-variant-2class name in addition the the standard custom class name of your widget.
These styles make the image span the full width of the widget, and position it at the top.
Next you can adjust the text to appear below the image, by applying a margin to the headline. Remember that CSS specificity may be important here as well.
Lastly, we'll need to adjust the "x" button in the corner of the modal to display prominently above the image.

Now to style the inline image, select the custom class name you defined. The example in this guide floats the image left of the text of the widget:

Remember you candownload the code for this exampleto get the completed JavaScript and CSS. This can act as a starting point for your own custom image widget.
Once you've tested and are happy with the look and feel of your image slideout, it's time for the most important step: defining the Lytics audience that should receive this Experience.
The example widget in this guide is targeted at an audience of users with ahigh momentumandsome affinityfor iPhones, the featured product of the slideout. Remember toupdate your config with the audience IDyou wish to serve the widget to.
Alternatively, as mentioned above, the image feature is natively supported by theLytics web Experiences. You would simply need to add the CSS to your website to customize the image of your widget.

You can create aRecommend ContentExperience by following thesestepsbut the keys to creating an effective recommended content campaign are building an audience and content collection.
You can use theContent Affinitytab of the audience builder to build an audience of users who show interest in a particular group of Topics (what Lytics calls an Affinity). Then, that audience can be used to target users with the desired Affinity in a personalized Experience.
Audience with any affinity for articles about "data science"
This audience can now be used in aRecommend Content(or any other) campaign to target users who have the desired level of interest for your chosen Affinity. You can combinemultiple rules and rulesetsto create highly refined audiences. You are also not limited to audiences based on content affinity, see theAudiencessection for other options.
Content collections give you the ability to group content together that you can then recommend in your campaigns. Collections can be a group of articles related by Affinities, Topics, recently published, author, hand picked by you, or a combination of any of these criteria. In addition, these collections can be dynamic. Content in a dynamic collection will be added to or removed automatically when they match or fail to match your criteria. For more information, seeContent Collections.

Next, you’ll need to navigate to the Experiences tab and pick the "Recommend Content" tactic for Lytics. The first step will be to choose the content collection you want to feature:
Next, select whether you want this to be based on a user's interests ("Highest Affinity"), content or product freshness ("Freshness"), or what a user has engaged with most recently ("Last Interaction"):

Paragraphs:
Content recommendations are a powerful, direct method for driving engagement of anonymous users with the goal of capturing their email address. Using Lytics, you can create audiences to present personalized ad sets through marketing platforms like Google Ads and Facebook. You can take the personalization one step further. Lytics can power inline content that serve content based on each user’s personal audience membership and content affinity.
Lytics usesdata science scoresto move users into preconfigured audiences based on their behavior. This use case relies on a user’sfrequency,recency, andintensityscores to identify those who are highly engaged with your content generally and, through further refining, individual content items, topics, or collections.
Users can be members of preconfigured audiences determined by  a combination of**characteristics.
For this use case we want to combine thecharacteristicEmail Capture Status: Unknown emailwith thebehavioral audienceLytics Deeply Engagedusing the “AND” rule. This new audience will target users without email addresses, i.e. anonymous users, who are deeply engaged with your content. What content that user is engaged with will vary and each user can receive different ads or emails based off the content they engage with the most.

While all the users in yourAnonymous Deeply Engagedaudience are engaged with your content different behaviors have led to this outcome. Some may have consistently engaged over a long time period while others may have consumed content over a relatively short period of time. Using thefrequencyscore, you could present message or recommend content specific to longtime anonymous, engaged users in effort to convert them to know users. Similarly, therecencyscore can be used to target new, but engaged users with a specific experience to convert them.
YourAnonymous Deeply Engagedaudience is a great target audience for site personalizations, content recommendations, and well-timed email capture forms.
To deliver the content most relevant to a user’s interest you can build additional audiences based onAnonymous Deeply Engagedwith added content affinity filters. SeeBuilding Audiences: Content Affinityto learn how to add content affinity rules to new and existing audiences.
YourAnonymous Deeply Engagedaudience is an excellent target to capture email address and convert users to a known status. See our buildCollect Leads Campaigndocumentation to learn how.

Paragraphs:
Using Lytics audiences you can identify anonymous traffic with higher potential to engage and/or convert. A powerful marketing use case is to retarget these users with Facebook and Google Ads, driving them to further interact with your brand.
This use case will provide a few suggested audience definitions to support your retargeting effort. These audiences will leverage the following building blocks:
Note:The Lytics StartSmart data schema supports a standard set of commerce fields including the two used in this use case. If you aren't using the StartSmart schema these fields may also be mapped to your account, for example if you've imported data fromSalesforceyou should have access to the fieldSalesforce: Most Recent Lead Status.
Using the building blocks mentioned above you can build one or more of these suggested audience to use in ad campaigns.
This audience combines the characteristicEmail Capture Status: Unknown emailwith the behavioral audienceLytics Deeply Engagedusing the “AND” rule. The deeply engaged characteristic uses theintensityscore, and is a great way to qualify anonymous traffic for targeting.

Combine theEmail Capture Status: Known emailwith theUser's Lifetime Valuefield using the "AND" rule to create a target audience of just your best customers. This audience would be a great source audience to generate a lookalike audience.

For B2B marketing you can substitute LTV with a field likeLead Statusto build an audience of open leads for retargeting or for use in a lookalike audience.

Want to further narrow your audience to only the most qualified users? Try experimenting with additional rules using thefrequency scoreto bring in more consistent users, or therecency scoreto target users who recently interacted with your brand. These qualifiers can help you create a further refined audience of users who are more likely to convert.
Once you've built your audience(s) you can export them to your ads platform for use using Lytics' build in integrations.
Anonymous users can be advertised to directly in Facebook. You can access theAnonymous Deeply Engagedyou built in Facebook with theCreate Web Traffic Audiences workflow. You can also target anonymous users in Google platforms such as Adwords through ourJavaScript integrationwith Google Analytics.
Known users can be targeted across both Facebook and Google, as well as drive lookalike audiences. You can export yourKnown High LTVandKnown Leadsaudiences viaFacebook custom audiencesandGoogle Adwords remarketing lists.

Paragraphs:
Targeting Lytics audiences with web Experiences allows you to achieve a level of personalized messaging to a group of users based on their common behaviors or interests. However, you can further personalize your Experiences at a one-to-one level by including specific user profile fields in the messaging for your widgets.
In this guide, you will create a bar widget containing a coupon code unique to the user usingentity field templates. This code must be a field on the Lytics user profile to display it in the widget.

This technique can be used to include any user field inline within a widget in the headline, message, or CTA link of an experience. Another common example may be to greet the user by their first and/or last name if the data is available in Lytics.
You can download the complete JavaScript configuration andAPI overridecommand for this example from theGithub examples repository. User field templates are also natively supported byweb personalize Experiencesin the Lytics UI.
Begin with a generic widget configuration containing a static coupon code in the message field.
This config will generate a bar widget with a CTA. You can use theconfirmActioncallbackto redirect the user to a checkout page with the static coupon code applied via a query parameter.

To customize this coupon code per user, you can access a field by the field name (in this example,offer_code) from the current user's Lytics profile using the bracket notation.
Fields that you wish to use in the template of your widget must besurfacedfirst.

You may use this bracket notation in theChoose URLstep of the Experience editor. So there is no need to make API overrides for this use case.
You may be wondering, what happens when the current user does not have the fieldoffer_codeon their profile? There are a couple ways to handle this:
Simplyensure that the targeting audiencerequires that the field in question exist.
You can define afallback value. This is a default static value to be shown ifoffer_codedoes not exist on the user profile, use the following notation:{{offer_code | FREE2019}}
Alternately, you may set the display conditionshowOnMissingFieldsvia the JavaScript configuration if you are using the SDK, or via anAPI overrideif you are using the Lytics UI.
Testing widgets that contain user profile fields can be tricky. If you are using the Pathfora SDK, it may help to use thepathfora.customDataobjectto simulate the user field data during the development process.
Alternatively, add theoffer_codefield to your current profile by sending an API request to the data stream which contains the raw data for the field with the appropriate identifier (usually_uid).
You can use thejstag.getid()function in the developer console of your website which has the Lytics JStag loaded to get your_uid.
Here is an example API call to add theoffer_codefield via thedefaultstream.
This example makes a request to the Lytics collector API for your account. Ifoffer_codeis mapped in the LQL for the streamdefault, and_uidis a unique identifier for the stream, it should add the valueFREE324234234to the user profile. Once you see it show up in your user profile in the Lytics UI, refresh your website to ensure that the widget is populated with the new field value.

The example widget in this guide will be targeted at an audience of high LTV customers who have the user profile fieldoffer_code. Remember toupdate your config with the audience IDyou wish to serve the widget to if you are using the Pathfora SDK.

Email newsletters are a valuable tool to share content, product features, or announcements with your customers. Readers of these daily or weekly newsletters are often the most engaged and valuable customers your brand has. A Lytics personalizecollect lead campaigncan assist in growing your email list by targeting valuable audiences made up of users likely to engage.
Effective campaigns begin with an effective audience. The goal here is to collect email addresses of visitors to your site that are not already signed for your email list. The following audience combinesmultiple rulesto target users with aquantity score of at least onewhoseemail is not known. Users with a quantity score less than 1 have little to no activity on your site and are not great candidates for engagement with an email mailing list. You also don't want to present a message to users who already receiving your newsletter. You are not limited to this criteria. You can target any audience who you think would be valuable to engage with via email.

Once you have an audience of users you would like to target use it when building yourcollect lead campaign. The key step is where, when, and how often you want your messagedisplayedto your users. You may only want to solict email addresses from a particular section of your site and only display the message after the user has spend at certain amount of time on your site.

Once your new campaign collects email addresses you canuse your campaign to build a new audience. A user who enters an email address will be considered converted, these users can be exported to to your ESP and added to your email list.

In general, audiences should be created in Lytics using the audiences builder, then pushed to actioning platforms via built-in integrations. These audiences update in real-time and can be automated to keep downstream tools in sync.
However, in some cases, there are more narrow and targeted audiences of users who you need to target for one-off campaigns or pushes to downstream tools.  In these cases, we recommend creating the audience in your data warehouse then pushing that group of users to Lytics.
Examples of audiences to build in Lytics:
Examples of one-off audiences to push from an external querying tool:

Crawling: https://docs.lytics.com/docs/improve-ad-campaign-metrics-with-predictive-targeting
Paragraphs:
Lytics predictive audiences can be leveraged in advertising tools to make intelligent targeting and bid strategy decisions within remarketing campaigns. While Lytics can populate audiences in your ad tools as seed audiences for lookalike modeling, this use case specifically uses Lyticsdata science scoresagainst your own first-party data to optimize remarketing efforts around users most likely to complete an action instead of anyone who may be eligible for a remarketing experience.
There are several ways to build your audience in Lytics that you can utilize in your ad platform for targeting. To begin testing this strategy, Lytics recommends defining and building the deterministic rule for who you’d like to retarget in your ad strategy. This most commonly looks like:
It’s likely that you have rules like this already set up in your ad tools. To improve the performance metrics of these campaigns, you can use Lytics to decrease the overall audience size available for targeting but increase the likelihood of conversion against your business goal. This will impact your ad KPIs by potentially decreasing the total number of unique impressions but increasing conversion rate and/or decreasing cost per acquisition.
To do this, layer in one of the Lytics out-of-the-boxbehavioral audiencesthat use data science, such asEngagement: Deeply Engaged Users.
*This rule set includes all deeply engaged users who haven’t made a purchase.
By passing this audience directly into an ad channel, your remarketing efforts will be more refined to only include users who are deeply engaged and more likely to convert than your total user base.
Lytics can also create data-science based audiences specific to a topic of interest for an individual user. This logic is more robust than retargeting users around a site category that they have shown past interest in because it evaluates changes in topics in real-time and assesses a user’s interest in a topic in relation to all existing users within your account and their actions. Read more aboutuser-level topic affinities here.
You can utilize acontent-affinity audiencefor remarketing as a single rule for an audience, or as part of a rule set as demonstrated below.
This rule set includes users with a high affinity for ‘Chicken’ and who have their membership on pause.
By using content affinity-based audiences for remarketing in ad channels, your ad copy and creative can be strategically paired to be more relevant to your customers based on what they have previously shown an interest in.
The last strategy for predictive audiences within Lytics is to rely on our proprietarySegmentMLproduct to do lookalike modeling across your own first-party data. Most advertisers are familiar with lookalike modeling within ad channels to extend your reach. You can also mine your own first-party data for more relevant lookalikes to offer your products and services to within an ad channel.
Your Lytics Account Manager or Services team can help you create predictive audiences within your account, which can then be exported into downstream ad tools the same way as any other audience built within Lytics. See theIntegrations documentationfor provider-specific information.

This summary report shows the growth of a custom predictive audience over a week.
While these audiences may be smaller than the lookalikes you’ll get back fromFacebookorGoogle Adsdirectly, because these users have interacted with your brand previously, and are showing signals towards behaving like your seed audience, they will have a higher conversion rate that can be influenced by additional ad campaigns with the right strategy and messaging.

Paragraphs:
Lyticscontent recommendationsare a powerful tool for personalization. They enable you to engage your visitors with the most relevant content based on their interests. Lytics web personalize Experiences support content recommendations natively, but withAPI overridesor thePathfora SDK, you can further customize the look and feel of recommendations in your widget.
In this guide, you will build a recommendation modal to reel users back in when they are thinking about leaving your website. You'll learn how to customize such a widget with custom CSS and additional display fields such as the name of the author and the publication date.

You can download the complete JavaScript configuration, CSS, and  API override command for this example from theGitHub examples repository.
Start with a basic message modal configuration. The goal of this Experience is to entice users to stay on your website, so you may want to use theshowOnExitIntentdisplay conditionto only show the modal when the user is about to leave the page.

Before you proceed, you will need to create a content collection. See the documentation oncontent collectionsto learn how to build a collection and the documentation onusing content collections for recommendationsfor instructions on how to get the ID of the collection, which you will need in the next step. The collection in this example contains blog posts that have been published within the last year.
Now to set up the recommendations in the config. Add therecommendandvariantsettings to your config. Then add the collection ID and set thevisitedsetting tofalse. This setting ensures that Lytics recommendations only return content that the user has not already visited.

Now you will have a basic modal with content recommendations displaying on exit intent. Since the example displays blog content, you may also want to show the date that the article was published and the author name. To do so, you can add thedisplayobject to your configuration.
You can even add some additional settings to style the date, and extend the amount of text shown in the article description.

Check out thePathfora content recommendations documentationto see the full list of settings you can apply to customize your content recommendation widget.
In this example, we will make some small adjustments to soften the look of the content recommendations. You can download the styles for this example fromGitHub.

When writing your own custom styles, remember that different users will see a different pieces of content based on interests. Be careful when adjusting the size of things like the image in relation to the text. Images from different articles may be of a different size, and text descriptions may vary in length if not controlled by thedescriptionLimitsetting.
Be sure to test your modal with multiple different content items. You can do this by adding theshufflesettingto your config, which will change the content every time you see the modal. You may also want to ensure that all content in your collection has similar image sizes if you do want to adjust its styles in the modal.

The example widget in this guide will be targeted at users in theLikely to Reengage characteristic. Remember to update your config with the audience slug you wish to serve the widget to.
Alternatively, you may build your widget as aweb personalize Experiencein the Lytics UI with theRecommend Contenttactic and apply therecommend.displaysetting with an API override. See theGithub Repositoryfor the exact override command.

Paragraphs:
When you need to reach new users that look like your best customers, create Predictive Audiences powered by LyticsLookalike Models. Campaigns run with Predictive Audiences improve customer engagement, drive higher conversion rates, and reduce ad spend.

Using Predictive Audiences can benefit marketers in a number of ways:
Predictive Audiences simplify your targeting strategies by eliminating the need to manually define parameters to sort your customers. Lytics gives you direct insight to help answer the question, "how do I know what to target users on?" Each Lookalike Model in Lytics has a Feature Importance chart that shows the mostimportant attributes that predict user conversionsfor your source and target audiences. These attributes include Lyticsbehavioral scores,content affinities, and otheruser fields.

In the example above, Lytics created a Lookalike Model to understand which of our documentation site users are mostly likely to move from "Casual Visitors" to "Deeply Engaged Users". As you can see in the chart, our model determined that "Total Pageview Count", "Quantity", and an affinity for "marketing" are the top three attributes of users mostly likely to become deeply engaged. Your Lookalike Models may simply confirm assumptions, but in others cases, they can offer a new understanding of your customers' behaviors and which factors really influence desired actions.
Once a Lookalike Model is built, you can easily create different Predictive Audiences to optimize the balance between reaching more people and targeting your best customers for each campaign. When reach is a priority, you can build Predictive Audiences with higher reach but lower accuracy to target more users. When Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) is a priority, you can build Predictive Audiences with higher accuracy but lower reach to target only the users mostly likely to convert.

For example, if you're targeting single purchasers to encourage them to become repeat purchasers, accuracy may be more important than reach. Learn more about how to optimize the trade-off betweenaccuracy vs. reach.
Predictive Audiences help you engage and convert customers across their lifecycle, from anonymous users visiting your website for the first time, to high lifetime value (LTV) customers that are brand advocates. Below are common examples of how to build Lookalike Models that power Predictive Audiences through different stages of your marketing funnel.

Depending on the sizes of your source and target audiences, your Lookalike Model may take a few minutes up to a few hours to build. On yourModel Dashboard, you'll see a "Building" status until the model is complete.
Once your model is built, view theModel Summaryto determine if it's ready for use in your targeting. You mustActivatea Lookalike Model before creating a Predictive Audience, which will evaluate users and write the model's prediction scores to user profiles. This process can take up to three days for large audiences.
On the summary page, clickCreate Predictive Audiencein the Model Usage section, which will open the audience builder pre-populated with your model's predictions. The default model decision threshold of 0.5 is used, but you canadjust the decision thresholdas needed to reach more users or be more accurate to only target users who are most likely to churn.

After creating a Predictive Audience, you may want to target this audience with emails to help them re-engage with your brand. For more information, check out our playbook onretaining customers.

Paragraphs:
Lytics webhooks paired with serverless functions are a great way to build custom workflows to power your marketing campaigns. This workflow is very flexible and can be configured as a trigger for a variety of platforms to send emails, push notifications, and alerts. This example uses a serverless cloud function to send a text message to a non-subscribed user when they become highly engaged viaTwilio.
In this example, you’re going to send a personalized text message to a user when they become highly engaged determined byLytics behavioral scores. Additionally, you only want to send messages to non-subscribed users who have a phone number. Therefore, you are going to need to create an audience with three criteria. First, only users who are (or become) deeply engaged based on Lytics data-science scores. Second, their profile has a phone number. And third, they are not yet a subscriber as the text message will include a sign up link.
In the audience builder, you're going to use anexisting audiencefor highly engaged users and twocustom rulesfor subscribers and phone numbers. For additional instructions on building audiences, check outthe audience builder docs.
NOTE:Twilio's API requires phone numbers with a country code (e.g. +11234567890). If phone numbers are not stored in this format in the user's Lytics profile the cloud function can be used to correctly format the number.

This example uses Google Cloud Functions to power this custom workflow, however this will work just as well with other serverless tools like AWS Lambda or Azure Functions. For a quickstart on Google Cloud Functions seeQuickstart: Using the gcloud Command-Line Tool.
The Lytics webhook sends the full profile of a user when they enter or exit the audience. The code below receives the profile in the body of the request, then uses the Twilio API to send a custom text message to the user.
Note:You'll also need aTwilio account. When using a Twilio free trial, you can only send text messages to the numbers in yourVerified Phone Number list.
Next, deploy the function. You can get your account_sid and auth_token from the Twilio dashboard.
After deploying the cloud function, you will be provided with an endpoint that triggers the function. You can also find this in the Cloud Functions console:

Next, you need to export the audience previously created. Return toLyticsand navigate toData>Integrationsand selectWebhooks. Next, clickNew WorkflowthenSegment Triggers Webhook, select the audience created previously moving it to the right column, enter the url trigger for your cloud function into theWebhook URLfield, and clickStart Export. You should received a message that your webhook was successfully created. When a user enters or exits the selected audience, the Lytics webhook will send a POST request to the provided URL, triggering the cloud function.

That’s it! You’ve successfully created a webhook trigger that will automatically send a text message to unsubscribed users when they enter the highly engaged audience.

Paragraphs:
Remarketing is considered to be one of the most efficient channels available for return on ad spend. If done correctly, this is a great channel for customer acquisition. However, most advertisers remarket wastefully. If your remarketing partners were more efficient you’d have more dollars to pursue new customers or more dollars to return to the bottom line.
Lytics can quantify recency, depth of visit, likelihood to return, likelihood to transact, and other metrics based on predictive data science and combine those scores with discrete factors such as categories browsed, content affinities, and whether or not someone is a subscriber or customer. Using this data alone can enable most of our clients to pay back their investment in Lytics within days or weeks.
Remarketing to users most likely to transact starts by building an audience that includes the users who show the greatest depth of engagement and have the most recent activity. Advertisers have had success measuring engagement with a semi-arbitrary metrics such as 3 or more pageviews but Lytics has found greater success (up to 60% more efficient) by usingLytics data science scores, in this casequantity. Similarly, usingLytics recency scorehas been more effective than a fixed date range in targeting the most recent users.
Using theLytics audience builder, you can build an audience based on twocustom rules. The goal is to produce an audience that represents the top 10% of your total audience. First, add a custom rule based onscore_quantity, setting the value that includes the top ~15% of your total audience. Second, add a custom rule based onscore_recency, setting a value that leaves ~10% of your total audience. You should play with these numbers to find the audience that makes the most sense for your campaign. A higher quantity score will produce an audience of users who are more deeply engaged while a higher recency score will target users who have been active more recently.

Finally, if you’re really looking to get the extra mile, you can avoid spending on remarketing to users that you can already reach through other channels such as email. Consider removing users for whom you have an email address. To filter users with known email addresses, add aexisting audience rulebased on theEmail Capture Status: Known Emailcharacteristic and toggleExcluded.

Your remarketing audience can be exported toFacebook,Google Ads, or other ad networks for use in your advertising campaign.

Paragraphs:
Lyticsweb Experiencesare a great way to quickly spin up a modal or slideout on your website with personalized messaging. For a deeper personalized experience, you can take it a step further by tailoring inline elements on your web page towards different Lytics audiences using thePathfora SDK.
In this guide, you will learn how to implementinline content modularizationwhich will show and hide different pieces of content on your website based on a user's audience membership. This example will provide content for following audiences: high momentum users, first time visitors, and users who have recently abandoned their cart during checkout.

You can download the complete HTML code for this example from theGithub examples repository. This example could also be implemented using Pathfora widgets with theinline layout. An example JavaScript configuration is included should you wish to try the alternate implementation.However, this guide will focus on the HTML solution, as it is often the preferred method given that the development process is very similar to adding a new section to your website, and there is no pre-defined structure of the content that may be displayed.
In this example you will use three audiences to determine what content should be shown in a section to the right of the main hero for the website. This is a small scale example, but as you can imagine this technique could be applied to multiple, major parts of your website to completely customize the site for your users.
Before your team does any design or copy writing it may help to determine which key Lytics audiences you would like to target. If your organization has the concept of "personas" you may want to think about how your website should communicate and look to each of these personas and then build or use existing audiences that represent these user archetypes. Regardless of the scale of your project, the audiences should inform the messaging.
Audiences used for inline content modularization must beAPI Enabledand have an API ID. You will need to know the IDs of your audiences for the next step.
Once you have finalized the audience definitions, designs, and copy for your inline personalized modules, simply start by building out the content as you normally would with HTML and CSS on your website. Start with the content to be displayed to a single audience. This is the HTML example of content displayed to first time visitors of the website:

Go ahead and build out all the code for each of your audiences. It may help to comment out the options that will be shown to different audiences as you go, so that you can simulate what an end user in each audience will see instead of viewing all personalized content options at once.
When all of your content is good to go it's time to apply the audiences. Consider the following definitions:
In the example code, there is a single group which will control the content displayed to the right of the hero, and four blocks within that group: one for each audience, and a fourth block to be displayed to users who are not a member of any of the audiences associated with the other blocks in the group. These concepts map to code with the followingdata-attributes:
Remember to check out thePathfora documentationfor more information on these attributes and additional code examples. Putting it all together, here's what the full content modularization example code looks like:
Ordering of blocks does matter. For example, you may be wondering what would a user who has a high momentum score and has recently abandoned their cart would see using the example above? Pathfora will select the first item in the group that is applicable to the current user based on audience membership, thus the user would see the block targeted at high momentum users. If you wanted it to be possible for the user to see both content blocks at once you would need to define them in separate groups.

You may notice some flickering of elements when the page loads. This can happen if Pathfora library and is loaded after the DOM itself has loaded. To get around this, you can add the following line of CSS to your website:
This ensures that all blocks are hidden upon page load, and once Pathfora has loaded it will set the proper display settings to show only the appropriate block for each group.

Paragraphs:
Content recommendations are a powerful tool to keep visitors engaged on your website. You can build an even deeper integration with Lytics content recommendations by embedding them directly onto your site.
In this guide, you will learn to implementinline content recommendationsusing the Pathfora SDK.

You can download the complete HTML code for this example from theGithub examples repository.
Before you proceed, you will need to create a content collection. See the documentation oncontent collectionsto learn how to build a collection. And the documentation onusing content collections for recommendationsfor instructions on how to get the ID of the collection, which you will need in the next step. The collection in this example contains product pages, so that the recommendation algorithm can recommend products to users based on their interests.
Start by thinking about how you want your content recommendations to look on the page. Check thePathfora documentationfor the list of available fields that you may include in the presentation of your content. This example will include an image, title, description and a link to the product page.

Next determine how many recommendations you want to show on the page. Similar tocontent modularization, Pathfora uses the concept of groups and blocks, but this time in a slightly different context:
This example has four blocks in the group. These concepts map to the followdata-HTML attributes:
There is an additional attributedata-pftypewhich is applied to multiple elements within the block. This identifies what field Pathfora should use fill in the value of the element. See thedocumentationfor in in-depth breakdown of what fields are available and how they should be named.
Now consider this HTML example for a single recommendation block:
These appear to be empty elements, however once Pathfora makes the call to the Lytics content recommendation API it will fill in the elements accordingly. Setting thesrcattribute for theimg, thehrefvalue for theaelement, and the inner text of the title and description elements.
That's really all there is to it. You can repeat this code to include multiple blocks for multiple recommendations, and then style your recommendations accordingly.

Remember that the recommendation API will return different content for different users based on their affinities in Lytics. Be sure to test the style of your recommendation block with different pieces of content in your collection to ensure that it will work for content with or without an image, descriptions of varying size, etc. Or, you may choose to adjust your content collection accordingly.
As mentioned in thecontent modularlization guide, you may notice some flickering of elements when the page loads. This can happen if Pathfora library and subsequent requests it makes to the Lytics recommendation API is loaded after the DOM itself has loaded. To get around this, you can add the following line of CSS to your website:
This ensures that all recommendation blocks are hidden upon page load, and once Pathfora has loaded it will populate the block with the content before showing it to the user.

Paragraphs:
Lytics audiences usingAffinitiesin combination withFacebook custom audiencesallows you to target known users with content based on topics they are interested in. You can use this to promote an upcoming event, product launch, or a new piece of content for your brand. You can also use the same Lytics content affinity audience withlookalike audiencesto serve relevant content to new users.
The Lyticscontent affinity enginebuilds atopic taxonomyfrom content on your website. Lytics will use this taxonomy and user activity data to determine a user's affinity for a topic. These content affinity scores are available in the audience builder, and will be core to building your target audience.
Select the piece of content you wish to promote. Then take some time to familiarize yourself with the topics in your Lytics account and try to identify the Lytics topics that are relevant to your content. You can sort by the average level of affinity on the topic list view to ensure you are using a popular topic for targeting criteria. You may choose one or more of these topics to include in anAffinity, which you can then use to create audiences.
Clicking on a topic displays a summary page which shows a full distribution of user interest.

For most marketing use cases, it's useful to target users based on their interests in a group of related topics. For this reason, Lytics enables you to create your own, brand-specific Affinities. You can also target users based on their interest in an individual topic. See ourAudience Builder documentationfor more information.
Once you have your Affinity rules included, verify that the user count of your audience looks correct. If you plan to use this as a source audience for a lookalike, Facebook expects anywhere from1,000 to 50,000 users. For a simple retargeting audience, you'll want to reach a broad number of users. You may adjust the sliders on your affinity rules accordingly.

Paragraphs:
Isolated, channel-centric events, like website clicks or email opens, don’t provide a comprehensive view of your customers or their intentions. Using this  kind of event data to drive the audience lists for your marketing ad campaigns can lead to your ad dollars being spent inefficiently by either targeting too many people with a generic message or targeting individuals who are unlikely to convert.
Lytics helps you improve your ROI by advertising to the right people based on the content they are interested in and how they behave across your communication channels.
Using the LyticsJavaScript Tag, Lytics will catalog your website content in real-time and group individuals based on their interest levels for particular topics or products. Additionally, using behavioral algorithms, the platform will analyze and score your customers by their overall engagement level across your communication channels, for example 'highly engaged'.

As your audiences change over time, use Lytics as a centralized hub for automatically syncing them with your connected advertising tools such as, Facebook Ads, AdRoll, Google Ads, or DoubleClick for Publishers, for an up-to-date view of your target customers.
TheLytics Query Language (LQL)allows you to refine your target audience and remove customers with certain profile attributes or behaviors, enabling further efficiencies in your ad spend.
